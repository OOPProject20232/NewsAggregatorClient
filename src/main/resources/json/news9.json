Kristofer McGuire, Keith Williamson, and Karla Walker face multiple charges, including fraud by false representation and fraudulent trading, for their alleged roles in persuading victims to invest in contracts for difference (CFDs). FCA Charges Three Individuals over CFD Trading Pension Fraud According to the FCA, victims were encouraged to invest their pensions in CFDs, which were then traded to generate large commissions for the accused, resulting in the near-total loss of the victims\u2019 pension funds. The FCA alleges that McGuire, Williamson, and Walker falsely represented their clients as professional investors to a trading platform. \u201cThe total known loss to victims is over £8 million,\u201d the FCA commented. The FCA's allegations cover activities between January 2015 and February 2023. Specifically, from January 2015 to June 2017, the three individuals allegedly made misleading representations to a CFD trading platform about their clients' qualifications as professional investors. Additionally, between January 2015 and June 2016, Williamson and McGuire are accused of using detrimental trading strategies to generate excessive commissions from CFD trades, at the expense of investors. McGuire faces further charges for allegedly making false statements to five individual investors from April 2016 to February 2023 to persuade them to invest through his firm, K&K Consult LTD. Legal Proceedings and Consumer Guidance The defendants are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on June 7. The charges they face include fraud by false representation, which, under the Fraud Act 2006, can lead to a fine and up to 10 years' imprisonment. Fraudulent trading, as defined under the Companies Act 2006, carries similar penalties. The FCA reminds that CFDs are known for their high risk, and 80% of customers lose money when investing in CFDs due to their leveraged nature. The FCA has implemented restrictions on the sale and marketing of CFDs to retail customers to mitigate consumer harm. The FCA continues its efforts to combat investment and pension fraud as part of the ScamSmart awareness campaign. Last year, it tackled 43 unauthorized debt solution providers, shutting down 30 websites and social media accounts. In 2023, the FCA took action against over 10,000 misleading financial advertisements and promotions.

SoundTalks is the name of this AI-powered device, which is intended to change the way of detecting respiratory diseases in pigs. It will most probably decrease the morbidity and mortality rates while empowering farmers with timely intervention strategies. Cutting-edge technology for early detection By using the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the tool \u2018SoundTalks\u2019 is designed to assist in the health improvement of pigs. The system relies on AI algorithms to \u2018hear\u2019 the frequency and the intensity of coughs in pigs, thus it notifies the producer to the possible onset of problems. The device has already been proven to be able to diagnose respiratory disease in pigs five days earlier than the conventional methods according to Boehringer Ingelheim. In contrast to the traditional means of detection, which are usually based on the visual inspection or the retrospective diagnosis, this new device can detect the respiratory issues up to five days earlier, thus, giving a chance for the intervention. Each SoundTalks covers a 10-meter radius and has a microphone that \u2018hears\u2019 the pigs and humidity and temperature sensors. The monitors send the pig noises to \u2018The Gateway,\u2019 which is connected to the cloud where sounds are analyzed. The devices that can listen and monitor are not new, but what is special about SoundTalks is the data that were used to create the algorithms it uses to compare and detect coughs and the fact that the system is always learning. The sound data is converted into a respiratory health score, which is inversely proportional to the risk of morbidity and mortality and is displayed in an online dashboard and a mobile app. The monitors themselves are also the ones that signal the respiratory health status of the pigs and the traffic-light system will alert the farmers to the anomalies so that they can identify and focus on the right groups of pigs sooner. Empowering farmers with actionable insights Findlay MacBean, head of livestock at Boehringer Ingelheim, stated, \u201cRespiratory diseases can be detrimental not only to the health and wellbeing of livestock but a farmer\u2019s bottom line.\u201d In the face of the general problems British pig farmers encounter nowadays, such as the lack of workers and the increasing costs of production, keeping herd health is becoming more difficult and, above all, more significant. By means of such tools as SoundTalks, Boehringer Ingelheim is determined to come up with new solutions which will make it possible for farmers to forecast, prevent and treat animal health problems, thereby, making them to be more productive. Paul Thompson, a vet at Garth Pig Practice, said that the tool would greatly improve the pigs\u2019 well-being and reduce the farmer\u2019s time and costs. He emphasized the role of tools like SoundTalks in helping farmers look ahead, stop, and cure animal health problems.","article_summary":"Boehringer Ingelheim, the world leader in animal health solutions, has presented an innovation that will change how pigs are managed.

In the past 24 hours, the Ripple token has dipped a fraction, on trading volume that surged 10%. XRP Price Prediction The Ripple price is consolidating sideways as part of a horizontal chop. It is stuck below the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $0.5665. The market is leaning in favor of the downside, with multiple momentum indicators suggesting a possible downside. To begin with, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the mean level of 50. This worsened by the position of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) in negative territory. With this, it is likely that the XRP price could extend the fall before a possible recovery. Based on the Fibonacci retracement indicator, the XRP price could provide another buying opportunity at $0.4228. GeckoTerminal: XRP/USDT 1-day chart A closer look at the RSI reveals that the momentum indicator has managed to record a steady series of higher lows since April. This points to a growing bullish sentiment that could bode well for the Ripple token. If the bulls increase their buying strength, the XRP price could recover. A move above the 50% Fibonacci placeholder of $0.5665 is expected to encourage more buying orders. In a highly bullish case, the Ripple price could extend the climb above the $0.7102 level.

This milestone allows investors to purchase tokens backed by tangible forest assets, promoting ecological sustainability and financial inclusion. Upwood.io has strategically chosen a 16.5-hectare forest plantation for its inaugural tokenization project, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in forest asset trading. By tokenizing these assets, Upwood.io enables fractional ownership, making it possible for a wider range of investors to engage in environmentally responsible investments previously accessible only to large-scale investors or industry specialists. This tokenization not only democratizes investment in forest assets but also aligns with sustainable environmental goals through the generation of carbon credits, derived from the forest\u2019s role in carbon sequestration. These credits, which can be sold on carbon markets or used to offset carbon emissions, provide an additional revenue stream for investors. In addition, Upwood.io plans to integrate agroforestry and carbon removal practices into its operations, testing mixed tree and plant cultivation that promises land value appreciation and increased carbon credit income. This approach aims to produce both long-term capital growth and immediate profit through quicker-growing plant species. \u201cTokenization of forest assets not only democratizes investment but also aligns investor returns with ecological impact,\u201d states Lauris Borodovskis, CEO of Upwood.io. \u201cOur platform ensures that every investor contributes directly to forest conservation and carbon sequestration efforts, driving substantial environmental benefits alongside financial gains.\u201d The security tokens represent ownership shares in the forest asset, with each token corresponding to a specific portion of the forest land. Investors gain a dual advantage: participating in sustainable forest management and earning potential returns from the growth in value of the forest assets and carbon credit sales. Upwood.io is committed to integrating cutting-edge blockchain technology with sustainable forestry practices. Our mission is to provide a platform that facilitates secure, transparent, and accessible investments in real-world forest assets, contributing to global environmental goals. Join us in our journey to reshape the landscape of sustainable investing. Visit www.upwood.io to learn more about our security token offering and how you can participate in making a significant impact on our planet\u2019s future.

The MVRV ratio tracks investor gains/losses. Bitcoin Cash\u2019s 30-day MVRV of -8.1% suggests losses, possibly prompting accumulation. Historically, BCH corrects at MVRV levels of -6% and -24%, labeling it an accumulation opportunity zone. Bitcoin Cash MVRV Ratio.

BCH Price Prediction: Key Level in Support Bitcoin Cash\u2019s price has surpassed the crucial 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level set at $430. This level is pivotal as it serves as the bear market support floor, historically yielding recoveries when tested. The same outcome is anticipated this time, given the altcoin is seeing support from its investors. The potential uptick could push BCH toward $450, right above the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement.

However, a breach has already failed once this month, and another failed breach could send Bitcoin Cash back to $430. If Bitcoin Cash\u2019s price falls below this line, it is likely to experience a drawdown to $410 or $400, thereby invalidating the bullish thesis.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) dips slightly following an increase in the SHIB burn rate. Rebel Satoshi ($RECQ) has emerged as the best ICO investors' pick as it rises by 120%. Elon Musk finally made good on a promise he made to Tesla Employees in Berlin a few weeks back, sparking a surge in DOGE\u2019s price. However, it has been a different tale for SHIB, which has been on the decline despite an increase in its burn rate. As such, experts believe that Rebel Satoshi's $RECQ is a better investment option than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Let's see why $RECQ is considered the best crypto to buy ahead of DOGE and SHIB. Elon Musk Fulfills Dogecoin Pledge As Tesla Formally Adopts Dogecoin As A Payment Method In a May 4 move, major e-car manufacturer Tesla, led by Elon Musk, accepted Dogecoin as an official payment option for its website. The payment page has been updated to support Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency community's favorite meme coin. Following recent events, there has been a noticeable surge in the value of Dogecoin. On May 4, DOGE was valued at $0.1602, but this figure rose to $0.1611 by May 5, indicating a 0.56% increase. Projections from Dogecoin experts hint at potential further growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to approximately $0.2847 by the end of May. Conversely, among DOGE analysts, bearish forecasts have emerged. Some DOGE analysts have expressed apprehensions regarding Dogecoin's recent performance. These DOGE analysts anticipate a potential decline, suggesting that the Dogecoin price action might lead DOGE to dip to around $0.1135 by the end of May. Shiba Inu Burns Over 80 Million SHIB Tokens; Burn Rate Spikes By 4,085% Shiba Inu has seen a significant increase in its burn rate, with more than 81 million tokens moved to dead wallets. Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn reports a burn rate of 4,085.94% since May 5. After this development, Shiba Inu observers have detected a decline in SHIB's value. SHIB experienced a decrease from $0.0000247 on May 5 to $0.0000242 on May 6, marking a 2.06% decline in the coin's price. This downturn has sparked worries among SHIB investors, who anticipate a further drop to $0.0000181 by the end of May. Conversely, certain Shiba Inu experts foresee that increased adoption could lead to a surge in SHIB's value. Thus, they see the coin potentially reaching $0.000038 by the end of the month. Rebel Satoshi's $RECQ Surges, Boosting Investor Confidence! Rebel Satoshi, an emerging meme coin project that aims to usher in a new era of decentralization, has dominated crypto headlines due to the rapid expansion of its dual-token ecosystem. Specifically, Rebel Satoshi completed the public presale of its governance and membership token, $RBLZ, in less than four months. Furthermore, $RBLZ debuted on four exchanges \u2013 CoinGecko, CoinStore, Uniswap, and DEXTools \u2013 following its presale, resulting in a 150% ROI. This amazing growth trajectory paved the way for Rebel Satoshi's foundation currency, $RECQ. $RECQ serves as Rebel Satoshi's base currency, underpinning all transactions, purchases, prizes, and fees. To this purpose, Rebel Satoshi has set the maximum supply of $RECQ coins at 3 billion. In May, $RECQ launched Stage 2 of its public presale at $0.0044, which indicates that Early Bird Round investors who purchased $RECQ at $0.0010 have earned a 120% ROI. Interestingly, when $RECQ achieves its listing price of $0.0125, Early Bird Round investors would profit by 525%. Stage 2 investors, on the other hand, will see their $RECQ holdings increase by 184% when the price reaches $0.0125. This huge growth potential makes $RECQ the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now!

Crypto hacks are news flash events that can have ripple effects and cost millions\u2014in this case, about $44.7 million. The hack resulted in millions of customer funds being lost, but NobleBlocks and Hedgey Finance quickly collaborated to help recover user funds. But how did all of this happen, and can NobleBlocks\u2019 response be something to emulate in the future? NobleBlocks\u2019 response and recovery efforts were open and fast, just like the values they intend to instill in their DeSci scientific publication platform project. How Did the Hedgey Finance Hack Happen? Hedgey Finance is a crypto project that helps other teams create and manage claim portals, on-chain token vesting, and lockups. On 19th April, they announced falling under the hands of malicious elements, resulting in them being exploited across a series of transactions worth $44.7 million. Basically, the attackers used flash loans to exploit the project\u2019s smart contract on Arbitrum and Ethereum blockchains. There was a loss of around $42.6 million on Arbitrum, while only around $2.1 million was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. According to experts, the major contributor to this attack was the lack of proper implementation of the input validation for one of the project\u2019s token-locking contracts. Thus, the attacker exploited this vulnerability, making the smart contract approve a series of token transfers. The vulnerable function in the smart contract is the \u2018createLockedCampaign\u2019 function, which should help create vesting or locked claims campaigns. So, this function had validation for almost all of its parameters besides the claimLockup parameter. This made assets locked in campaigns available for withdrawal, allowing the attackers to withdraw different tokens, including USDC, NOBL, MASA, and BONUS. How Was NobleBlocks Affected by the Hack? Decentralized Science (DeSci) project NobleBlocks was one of the protocols affected by the atrocious hack. Immediately, they took to their X account to announce to their community and provide important safety measures to their users. Hedgey Finance was a token infrastructure platform where many NOBL tokens were vested, and the hacker stole some of them. According to another announcement from Hedgey Finance on X, they specified that around $1.9 million NOBL tokens were stolen from the attack. Hedgey Finance also clarified that only their platform was affected by the attack and not that of NobleBlocks. Thus, all activities on NobleBlocks could continue, including PinkSale token participants. Response and Recovery Efforts Image from Etherscan (Hedgey Finance\u2019s messages to the hacker on Etherscan) NobleBlocks and Hedgey Finance collaborated and are working to ensure that the funds stolen by the hackers are recovered. According to media sources, Hedgey Finance is working closely with Consensys Diligence and SEAL_Org to manage what has happened. Furthermore, they said they sent a message to the hacker on Etherscan as they began fund recovery. NobleBlocks shared updates from their close communication with Hedgey and an MEV bot operator, Coffeebabe, with their community. Their press release stated that efforts to recover NOBL and ETH are ongoing and that the affected balances will soon be restored. Regarding their current token status, NobleBlocks mentioned that they believe it is now safe for their users to trade NOBL tokens again. Furthermore, any other token within token vesting infrastructure like Hedgey Finance is now securely locked, while those stolen by the hacker have been liquidated. The Challenges Facing Scientific Publishing \u2013 Is DeSci the Answer? Moving ahead of the hack, many challenges face the publishing of scientific articles, including timely review processes, high publication fees, and transparency. Scientific progress has enough barriers to overcome, and publishing findings should represent achievement and accomplishment. But those sensations are often dampened by long waiting times for approvals and hefty Article Processing Charges (APCs) charges. Individual researchers and teams not only invest their energy but often provide peer-reviewing services for free as a part of the scientific community. Still, when they themselves publish, the very same community-driven research teams are met with as much as $500 to cover the costs of publishing in a lower-tier journal, a whopping $2,500 for mid-tier journals, and about $6,000 for top-tier journals. Nevertheless, while a number of hybrid cost-sharing journals have emerged, hurdles remain. Enter blockchain technology. By utilizing the benefits of blockchain technology alongside proper incentives and reward mechanisms, the scientific sector can scale more fairly in a system where the pricing structure is highly monopolized. Understanding What NobleBlocks Is and How it Works Image from NobleBlocks NobleBlocks is pushing for change and empowering scientists and knowledge creators alike to join the DeSci (Decentralized Science) revolution. More specifically, NobleBlocks will focus on removing hurdles such as high APCs while setting up mechanisms to help create more fair, qualified, and timely reviews. NobleBlocks creates a public infrastructure built on the blockchain for developing, reviewing, managing, and distributing scientific articles. By introducing DeSci, this crypto project aims to increase community engagement and satisfaction, as well as much-needed incentivization and transparency to manage the growth in scientific research and publication NobleBlocks does this by employing the following: Innovative Scientific Publishing NobleBlocks introduces a couple of innovative and revolutionary processes to ensure they address the inefficiencies of traditional scientific publishing. First, they introduced decentralization, allowing authors of different backgrounds to get their works published. Secondly, the introduction of blockchain technology brought about immutability, subsequently leading to a permanent record of publications. Other important innovations include reduced costs for researchers and an efficient peer-to-peer review process. Community Empowerment NobleBlocks allows interaction and communication among its community members. In fact, through its NOBL token, it recognizes and rewards the efforts of editors and reviewers on its platform. Final Thoughts on NobleBlocks\u2019 Response Although NobleBlocks suffered collateral damage from the attack on the Hedgey Finance token vesting platform, they were the innocent bystander, with more than $1.9 million worth of NOBL tokens stolen. However, NobleBlocks remains undiscouraged and instead swung into action, collaborating with important entities like Hedgey Finance and Coffeebabe to ensure the damages suffered from the hack are addressed. There will always be hurdles when embarking on and building projects with a high risk-to-reward ratio, and while this one incident may be a hurdle beyond NobleBlocks\u2019 control, the team maintains its resilience and commitment to democratizing the scientific publishing landscape.

Sonne Finance exploited Decentralized liquidity provider Sonne Finance fell victim to a $20 million exploit on its Optimism network-based USDC and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) contracts, according to blockchain security firm Cyvers. In a May 15 statement, the DeFi protocol confirmed the incident and attributed the exploit to a donation attack on its Compound v2 forks. It stated: \u201cWe avoided the issue in the past, by adding the markets with 0% collateral factors, adding collateral and burn them, only then increase the c-factors according to the proposals.\u201d However, an integration attempt of VELO into the Optimism market allowed the attacker to exploit the protocol unnoticed, resulting in the loss. Meanwhile, security experts prevented an additional $6.5 million theft by injecting $100 VELO as collateral into the soVELO pool. Sonne Finance has expressed readiness to offer a bounty to the attacker as efforts to recover the funds continue.

This milestone allows investors to purchase tokens backed by tangible forest assets, promoting ecological sustainability and financial inclusion. Upwood.io has strategically chosen a 16.5-hectare forest plantation for its inaugural tokenization project, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in forest asset trading. By tokenizing these assets, Upwood.io enables fractional ownership, making it possible for a wider range of investors to engage in environmentally responsible investments previously accessible only to large-scale investors or industry specialists. This tokenization not only democratizes investment in forest assets but also aligns with sustainable environmental goals through the generation of carbon credits, derived from the forest\u2019s role in carbon sequestration. These credits, which can be sold on carbon markets or used to offset carbon emissions, provide an additional revenue stream for investors. In addition, Upwood.io plans to integrate agroforestry and carbon removal practices into its operations, testing mixed tree and plant cultivation that promises land value appreciation and increased carbon credit income. This approach aims to produce both long-term capital growth and immediate profit through quicker-growing plant species. \u201cTokenization of forest assets not only democratizes investment but also aligns investor returns with ecological impact,\u201d states Lauris Borodovskis, CEO of Upwood.io. \u201cOur platform ensures that every investor contributes directly to forest conservation and carbon sequestration efforts, driving substantial environmental benefits alongside financial gains.\u201d The security tokens represent ownership shares in the forest asset, with each token corresponding to a specific portion of the forest land. Investors gain a dual advantage: participating in sustainable forest management and earning potential returns from the growth in value of the forest assets and carbon credit sales. Upwood.io is committed to integrating cutting-edge blockchain technology with sustainable forestry practices. Our mission is to provide a platform that facilitates secure, transparent, and accessible investments in real-world forest assets, contributing to global environmental goals. Join us in our journey to reshape the landscape of sustainable investing.

The recent addition brings the value of the country\u2019s total Bitcoin portfolio to nearly $354 million at current prices, with the country\u2019s Bitcoin Office holding a total of 5,750 BTC. El Salvador Adds To Bitcoin Holdings El Salvador\u2019s decision to grant Bitcoin the status of legal tender was met with criticism, but it has proven to be a lucrative move. Since the announcement, the country has steadily accumulated BTC. Recent reports reveal that El Salvador has added an additional 473.5 Bitcoins worth $29 million since September 2021. This brings the count of BTC held by El Salvador to 5,750 BTC, worth around $354 million at current prices. These financial gains underscore the potential of Bitcoin mining for the country. The newly mined Bitcoins were made possible thanks to a unique and innovative approach. A small amount of geothermal energy generated by the country\u2019s Tecapa volcano is harnessed, providing a green and eco-friendly way for El Salvador to accumulate Bitcoin. This method sets El Salvador apart in the world of Bitcoin mining, where energy consumption is a major concern. A Green Initiative El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, who was recently re-elected for a second term, had directed his administration to install 300 processors to mine Bitcoins from the volcano. The state-owned power plant produces 102 megawatts of energy, out of which 1.5 megawatts are dedicated to cryptocurrency, namely Bitcoin mining. The mining process requires miners to expend a significant amount of energy for computing and cooling data processing centers. These centers solve complex mathematical equations and mine cryptocurrencies called Bitcoin. The entire mining process is known as Proof-of-Work. Cryptocurrency mining has come under increased scrutiny by governments due to its high power consumption and carbon emissions. However, El Salvador\u2019s innovative green method has the potential to change the game. By amassing Bitcoin while significantly reducing its environmental impact, El Salvador is on the brink of transforming the perception of cryptocurrency mining. This development offers hope for a more sustainable future in the crypto industry. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency miners Foundry USA, ViaBTC, Ant pool, F2Pool, and Binance Pool have pooled their resources to win a reward for opening a blockchain that can verify the last three years of bitcoin transactions from the power plant, according to a statement by the country\u2019s Bitcoin Office.

This straightforward gameplay resonated with users, leading to a peak of six million daily active users and a total player base of 35 million. This article delves into what Notcoin is, how it works, and the exciting opportunities it offers, including staking BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens ($NOT). In Notcoin, players earn in-game currency by tapping on a gold coin within the Telegram app. The energy required to tap the coin depletes and refills over time, preventing continuous gameplay without breaks. Players can invite friends to join the game, enhancing their experience and potentially increasing their earnings. The game features a global leaderboard, divided into tiers from Silver to Diamond, where players can see how they rank against others worldwide. Boosts and Power-ups To increase their earning potential, players can use various boosts or power-ups. These include daily refreshable boosts like \u201cFull Energy\u201d and \u201cTurbo\u201d boosts, as well as permanent boosts purchasable with Notcoin. These power-ups allow players to earn more coins per tap and extend their energy capacity. An Auto-Tap bot is also available, collecting coins on behalf of the player even when they are not actively playing. Cosmetic Upgrades Players can spend their earned Notcoin on cosmetic upgrades, changing the appearance of the game\u2019s background or the coin they are tapping. These customizations add a fun and personalized element to the game. The NOT Token The excitement around Notcoin isn\u2019t just about the game itself but also the upcoming launch of the $NOT token. The NOT token will be listed on The Open Network (TON), which was originally founded by Telegram. The total supply of $NOT is 102,719,221,714, with the entire supply expected to be in circulation upon listing. Token Distribution and Fairness One of the unique aspects of Notcoin is its approach to token distribution. All $NOT tokens will be awarded to players who earned Notcoin through the tap-to-earn game. This method ensures a fair distribution, avoiding the creation of early whales typically seen in other cryptocurrency projects. While 100% circulation upon listing is planned, not all tokens will immediately enter trading, as some may remain unclaimed or locked in allocations. Ecosystem Contributions Notcoin encourages community participation and contribution. Players can earn $NOT by exploring Web3 products, playing new games, and adding value to the ecosystem. Additionally, Web3 builders can offer their products to the community through Notcoin campaigns, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment. Staking BNB and FDUSD to Farm $NOT Binance has announced the listing of $NOT on its platform, providing users with the opportunity to stake BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens. This initiative is part of Binance\u2019s 54th Launchpool project, allowing users to earn rewards by participating in the staking pools. Staking Details Farming Period: 2024-05-13 00:00 (UTC) to 2024-05-15 23:59 (UTC) Listing Date: 2024-05-16 12:00 (UTC) Trading Pairs: NOT/BTC, NOT/USDT, NOT/BNB, NOT/FDUSD, and NOT/TRY Staking Pools and Rewards Stake BNB: 2,619,340,153 NOT in rewards (85%) Stake FDUSD: 462,236,497 NOT in rewards (15%) Users can stake their BNB and FDUSD into separate pools to farm NOT tokens over three days. The webpage for staking will be available 24 hours before the Launchpool starts. To participate in the Notcoin airdrop and staking, visit Binance and stake your BNB or FDUSD. Remember to do your research and ensure the safety of your funds. Regster on Binance Project Announcement: Notcoin on Binance Launchpool Binance Research: Notcoin Project Binance Megadrop In addition to staking BNB and FDUSD to earn $NOT tokens, users can also participate in Binance\u2019s new Megadrop concept. The Binance Megadrop is designed to reward loyal BNB stakers with tokens from future projects listed on Binance Launchpool. By staking BNB for extended periods, preferably 120+ days, users enhance their eligibility for these airdrops, gaining early access to promising new tokens and maximizing their potential rewards. Lockup Duration (Days) BNB Staked Score 30 1 BNB 100 60 1 BNB 110 90 1 BNB 120 120 1 BNB 130 What is Binance Megadrop? The Binance Megadrop allows users to stake BNB for extended periods to increase their chances of receiving airdrops from future projects. This innovative concept is aimed at rewarding loyal Binance users and providing them with early access to new tokens. Increasing Your Chances with Binance Megadrop By staking BNB, users not only earn $NOT tokens but also increase their chances in the Binance Megadrop. This approach allows users to benefit from both immediate rewards and long-term potential through future airdrops. Personal Opinions and Predictions Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project\u2019s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth. Binance will be the first platform to list the $NOT token, with trading starting on May 16, 2024. Players who earned Notcoin in the game will receive an airdrop of the real $NOT token, creating an exciting bridge between the virtual and real-world value. Pre-market Vouchers Before the airdrop, Notcoin introduced an NFT voucher program, allowing players with over 10 million Notcoin to convert their earnings into NFT vouchers. These vouchers can be bought, sold, or traded before the $NOT token launch, providing a speculative market for early adopters. The Future of Notcoin With the mining phase of the game ending on April 1, Notcoin is poised for a significant evolution. The game will return after the token launch with new gameplay mechanics and reduced rewards. Companies looking to gain exposure to Notcoin\u2019s large audience will need to buy $NOT on the open market and use it to activate features within the game. Potential Additions and Changes Open Builders, the creators of Notcoin, plan to enhance the game with additional features, such as a trading bot for buying and selling crypto tokens via Telegram. The goal is to create a more visual and user-friendly interface compared to existing text-based trading bots. Community and Ecosystem Growth Notcoin\u2019s model emphasizes community involvement and ecosystem growth. By allowing users to earn $NOT through various activities and encouraging Web3 builders to engage with the community, Notcoin aims to create a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem. Opinions and Predictions Given the innovative nature of Notcoin and its fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant potential. The project\u2019s engagement strategy and large user base provide a solid foundation for future growth. Price Predictions: Listing ATH Price: $0.002 \u2013 $0.003 Market Cap: $400M \u2013 $500M As the ecosystem develops and more use cases for $NOT emerge, the token could see substantial appreciation in value.","article_summary":"","publisher":{"name":"NewsBTC","logo":"https://t1.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=https://www.newsbtc.com/&size=64"},"creation_date":"2024-05-15T09:52:34Z","categories":["bnb","fdusd","web3","token","ton","cryptocurrency","nft","crypto"],"article_link":"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/notcoin-stake-bnb-and-fdusd-to-farm-not-tokens/","thumbnail_image":"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/binance-launchpool-notcoin.jpeg?fit=460%2C259"},{"article_title":"XRP Price Dips 4% In A Week As This Green AI Crypto Presale Races Towards $4 Million","author":"Lockridge Okoth","article_detailed_content":"The XRP price has dropped 4% in the last seven days to trade for $0.5011 as of 02:32 a.m. EST.
