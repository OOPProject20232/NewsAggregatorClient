During his keynote speech at Google\u2019s I/O 2024 developer conference on May 14, CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted several upcoming deployments of the AI model, emphasizing the importance of AI, he mentioned AI 121 times during his 110-minute presentation, with Gemini taking the spotlight. Launched in December, Gemini is set to become a central component of Google\u2019s services. Google is integrating this large language model (LLM) into nearly all of its products, including Android, Search, and Gmail. Users can expect the following in the future. Gemini A year ago, at the I/O stage, plans for Gemini were unveiled \u2014 a frontier model designed to be natively multimodal, capable of reasoning across various inputs. Since then, Gemini models have been introduced, showcasing top-notch performance on multimodal benchmarks. Gemini 1.5 Pro followed, offering a significant advancement in processing long context. With over 1.5 million developers now using Gemini across various tools, its capabilities are being utilized for debugging, gaining insights, and creating the next generation of AI applications. Product Progress and App Interactions Gemini\u2019s functionality is expanding to include seamless interaction with applications. In the upcoming update, users will enjoy the convenience of asking Gemini to perform tasks like effortlessly dragging and dropping AI-generated images into messages. Additionally, YouTube users will have the ability to prompt Gemini to extract specific information directly from videos by selecting the \u201cAsk this video\u201d option. Gemini Live and Gemini in Gmail Gmail is incorporating AI integration through a new feature called Gemini. With Gemini, users will have the ability to search, summarize, and compose emails using advanced AI assistance. Moreover, the AI assistant will handle more intricate tasks like aiding in e-commerce returns by searching for relevant emails, locating receipts, and completing online forms. Google recently introduced an innovative feature named Gemini Live, offering users the opportunity to engage in extensive voice conversations with AI directly on their smartphones. This chatbot is designed to seamlessly accommodate interruptions for further clarification during responses, while also dynamically adjusting to users\u2019 speech nuances in real-time. Moreover, Gemini possesses the capability to interpret and respond to the physical environment by analyzing photos or videos captured by the device. Multimodality Developments Google is currently engaged in the development of advanced AI agents capable of sophisticated reasoning, planning, and execution of complex tasks with user oversight. These agents are designed to handle various input modalities such as text, images, audio, and video, expanding their capabilities beyond traditional text-based interactions. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google & Alphabet stated, \u201cThe power of Gemini \u2014 with multimodality, long context, and agents \u2014 brings us closer to our ultimate goal: making AI helpful for everyone.\u201d A notable addition is the \u201cAsk Photos\u201d feature, enabling users to search their photo libraries using natural language queries. Powered by Gemini, this feature leverages contextual understanding, object and facial recognition, and summarization capabilities to provide relevant responses to user inquiries about their photo memories.

This number is twice the total created on the Ethereum blockchain from 2015 to 2023. These developments underscore the volatile and often precarious nature of investing in new crypto ventures. New Meme Coins Take Over Crypto Market Grogan highlighted these figures through the Dune dashboard chat, indicating a significant expansion in the crypto sector. The bulk of this surge in token creation occurred on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Specifically, Ethereum saw 376,642 new tokens, while Solana experienced an average daily creation of over 20,000 tokens. Notably, 886% of the new tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, amounting to 327,553, debuted on Coinbase\u2019s layer-2 network, Base. This platform has attracted many developers, especially those focusing on meme coins, due to its reduced operational costs.

Source: Dune Furthermore, the total value locked (TVL) on Base has soared by 627% since the beginning of the year, now reaching a remarkable $5.4 billion, according to L2beat. Meme coins are the primary reason for this increase. However, the crypto community has also criticized the rapid proliferation of meme coins. Many in the community view these tokens as high-risk, pointing out that they are often scams to exploit trading bots and inexperienced investors. \u201cMost of them are just spam to farm sniper bots. I saw a guy launching tokens with gibberish names on base just to rug-pull bots that auto-bought,\u201d an X user commented on Grogan\u2019s post. Moreover, the regulatory environment has been less stringent for meme coins compared to more traditional or innovative crypto projects. Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz has criticized this regulatory approach, arguing that it fosters an ecosystem rife with trivial projects at the expense of more meaningful, blockchain-based solutions. Investing in this market involves substantial risks. Crypto Koryo, a data scientist, emphasizes the high-risk, low-reward nature of meme coin investments. The barrier to creating new coins has significantly lowered, leading to market saturation. \u201cBack then, deploying an ERC-20 token wasn\u2019t something the average Joe could easily do. But today, anybody can do it,\u201d Koryo states. Koryo advises investors to diversify substantially if they choose to engage with meme coins. He warns that without adequate diversification, an investor\u2019s portfolio could drop to zero.

As a community token, $NOT aims to foster engagement, play, and contribution within its ecosystem. With the upcoming launch on Binance Launchpool, users can stake BNB and FDUSD to farm Notcoin tokens, making it an exciting opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. This article will explore the origins, mechanics, and future prospects of Notcoin, as well as the specifics of the staking process on Binance. Origins of Notcoin Notcoin emerged as a simple yet addictive game within the Telegram messaging app. Developed by Open Builders, the game invited users to tap a golden coin displayed on their screens to earn an in-game currency called Notcoin. This tap-to-earn mechanism quickly gained traction, attracting 35 million total players and peaking at six million daily active users. The game\u2019s success can be attributed to its straightforward gameplay, community engagement, and the promise of future crypto rewards. Gameplay Mechanics Players begin by opening the Telegram app and tapping the Notcoin bot. A golden coin appears on the screen, which players tap to earn Notcoin. Energy depletes with each tap and refills slowly over time, preventing endless clicking. Players can boost their earnings through daily \u201cFull Energy\u201d and \u201cTurbo\u201d boosts or by purchasing permanent boosts with Notcoin. Additionally, players climb a global leaderboard divided into tiers, from Silver to Diamond league. Completing quests, such as following a Twitter account or joining a Telegram community, also earns extra tokens. Cosmetic upgrades, like changing the game\u2019s background or the appearance of the coin, can be purchased with Notcoin, enhancing the user experience. Transition to $NOT Token The culmination of Notcoin\u2019s in-game efforts is the transition to the $NOT token, set to launch on The Open Network (TON). Unlike many crypto projects with early whales, Notcoin aims for fair distribution by airdropping 100% of the $NOT tokens to the community. The total supply of $NOT is 102,719,221,714, with an equal circulating supply upon listing. However, this does not mean all tokens will immediately enter trading; unclaimed airdrops and other allocations will gradually enter the secondary market. Staking BNB and FDUSD to Farm Notcoin Tokens As part of the Binance Launchpool, users can stake BNB and FDUSD to farm $NOT tokens. The staking process is simple and rewards participants with a significant portion of the total token supply. Here are the details: Staking Period and Rewards Farming Period: May 13, 2024, 00:00 (UTC) to May 15, 2024, 23:59 (UTC). Total Rewards: 3,081,576,650 NOT tokens. Stake BNB: 2,619,340,153 NOT (85% of rewards). Stake FDUSD: 462,236,497 NOT (15% of rewards). How to Participate Register on Binance: Create an account on Binance using the referral link: Binance Registration. Stake BNB or FDUSD: Visit the Launchpool webpage (available 24 hours before the farming starts) and stake your BNB or FDUSD. Earn Rewards: Tokens will be distributed daily based on the amount of BNB or FDUSD staked. Listing on Binance After the farming period, $NOT will be listed on Binance on May 16, 2024, at 12:00 (UTC). Trading pairs will include NOT/BTC, NOT/USDT, NOT/BNB, NOT/FDUSD, and NOT/TRY. The Seed Tag will be applied to $NOT, indicating its potential for significant growth. The Broader Ecosystem and Future Prospects Explore, Play, Contribute, and Offer Notcoin\u2019s ecosystem revolves around four key pillars: Explore: Users earn rewards by discovering new web3 products. Play: Participation in games yields additional rewards. Contribute: Adding value to the ecosystem through various means also earns rewards. Offer: Web3 builders can promote their products through Notcoin campaigns. Integration with Other Projects Notcoin plans to integrate with other web3 projects, allowing users to earn rewards by engaging with different content. These projects will need to purchase NOT tokens on the open market and deposit them into a smart contract to activate these features. Pre-Market Vouchers Before the $NOT token launch, Notcoin introduced NFT vouchers. Players with over 10 million Notcoin could convert their coins into vouchers, which can be traded before the token launch. This system allows high-level players to speculate on the future value of $NOT. Future Developments Post-launch, Notcoin\u2019s gameplay will resume with some changes. While no new tokens will be minted, companies can sponsor in-game rewards to gain exposure to Notcoin\u2019s vast audience. Additionally, Open Builders plans to introduce trading bot functionality, enabling users to buy and sell crypto tokens directly within Telegram. Personal Opinions and Price Predictions Given Notcoin\u2019s massive user base and the fair distribution model, the $NOT token has significant growth potential. The token\u2019s price could initially range between $0.002 to $0.003, with an all-time high (ATH) around $0.004. With a market cap potentially between $400 million to $500 million, $NOT presents an exciting investment opportunity. Conclusion Notcoin\u2019s journey from a viral Telegram game to a community-driven token on Binance Launchpool exemplifies the innovative potential of web3 projects. By staking BNB and FDUSD, users can farm $NOT tokens and participate in a dynamic ecosystem that rewards exploration, play, and contribution. With its upcoming listing on Binance and plans for future integrations, Notcoin is poised to become a significant player in the crypto space.

Prior to holding a dual role as Concordium\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer, Stiebar-Bang worked at Spotify, where she was in charge of managing its cross-functional teams. It\u2019s clear then that she brings a wealth of experience to Brillion, which is one of the most ambitious smart wallet projects around. What Is Brillion? For the uninitiated, Brillion is the official crypto wallet for the Nexera ecosystem, and it provides unfettered access to that project\u2019s extensive range of Web3 tools, including a decentralized identity service known as Nexera ID and Arkefi, which is an investment platform centered on real-world assets or RWAs, such as tokenized art, real estate and luxury goods. While focused on AllianceBlock\u2019s ecosystem, Brillion is an extremely capable smart crypto wallet in its own right, with support for multiple DeFi protocols and hundreds of crypto tokens, enabling activities such as trading, gaming and more from directly within its app. As a smart wallet, it also supports next-generation features such as social login and recovery, doing away with the need to remember a seed phrase, plus verifiable credentials to enhance user security and give them more control over their identity-related information. Perhaps the most intriguing feature of Brillion is its ability to integrate directly with users\u2019 traditional bank accounts to simplify crypto onboarding. With this unique capability, it supports seamless fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat exchanges, giving users the ability to easily move funds between their bank account and Web3 with some of the lowest fees in the business. The integrated bank accounts also makes Brillion the perfect platform for sending remittances, with its fees said to be six-times cheaper than traditional services. Users can send fiat to any country in the world, exchanging their money for crypto to perform the swap instantly, before exchanging it back to fiat again in the recipient\u2019s favored currency. From Web2 To Web3 With Stiebar-Bang at the helm, Brillion is now looking to strengthen its already comprehensive smart wallet offering and further tighten the integration between traditional finance and digital assets. The new CEO will oversee every aspect of Brillion\u2019s growth strategy, keeping a watchful eye on innovation, product development and day-to-day operations, while heading up talent management. Stiebar-Bang said Brillon is committed to simplifying the transition of users from Web2 to Web3 by making it more accessible and intuitive. \u201cOur focus on extending into RWAs, DePIN and Autonomous Agents signifies our dedication to innovation and user-centric design,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to seamlessly connect the digital world with the real world by providing billions of users with the UX standards they now expect from online financial services.\u201d Joining her in this mission will be the company\u2019s new Chief Product Officer Gantavya Sharma and Chief Marketing Officer Sunny Sian. Sharma has accumulated experience working in both Web3 and traditional finance, having previously held leading roles at Bitstamp, Fiserv and Barclays Bank, with a focus on the development of crypto, banking and payments products. At Brillion, he\u2019ll help to pioneer yet more innovations that extend its usefulness as a portal for digital, real-world assets. \u201cOur vision at Brillion is to be the platform that allows our partners to develop experiences that shape this future,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Brillion\u2019s marketing team will be bolstered by its new leader Sian, who previously worked at Polkadot and ConsenSys on Web3 products and services such as MetaMask, Diligence, Infura and Linea. In his new role, he will head up Brillion\u2019s marketing strategy in order to grow its customer base and accelerate brand engagement. Sian said what attracted him to Brillion is its smart capabilities that dramatically simplify the Web3 experience for users, making modern finance accessible without barriers. \"Web3 Wallets are here to stay, but they often feel unnecessarily complex, almost to a fault,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWith the rise of smart wallets and this category's exciting use cases coupled with improved automation, security and UX, we should embrace these innovations alongside today's behavioral patterns. Stiebar-Bang, Sharma and Sian were given a warm reception by Brillion\u2019s board members Rachid Ajaja and Matthjis De Vries. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that under their leadership Brillion will bring the next billion users to web3 by bridging the gap between its digital and real world applications,\u201d they said in a statement. The executive trio\u2019s immediate focus will be on transforming Brillion into a smart wallet that brings digital assets closer to real-world use cases in areas such as compliance, ease of use, security and integration with traditional banking services.

North Korea Caught Laundering Millions Via Shady Crypto Mixer","author":"Christian Encila","article_detailed_content":"Once more, North Korea has demonstrated its cyber prowess, possibly undermining international sanctions by using cryptocurrencies. According to a recent assessment by UN sanctions monitors, North Korea is suspected of using the Tornado Cash platform to launder a whopping $148 million that was taken from a cryptocurrency exchange in March. This event highlights how difficult it is becoming to enforce sanctions in the digital era, when illegal actors can hide their identities behind cryptocurrencies. Mixing Up The Rules: How Tornado Cash Facilitated Money Laundering According to the UN report, the stolen funds, believed to be from the HTX exchange hacked in late 2023, were funneled through Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. These platforms obfuscate the origin of transactions by essentially pooling funds together and then distributing them to new addresses. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to track the original source of the money. NORTH KOREA LAUNDERED $147.5 MILLION IN STOLEN CRYPTO IN MARCH, SAY UN EXPERTS North Korea laundered $147.5 million through virtual currency platform Tornado Cash in March after stealing it last year from a cryptocurrency exchange, according to confidential work by United\u2026 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) May 14, 2024 North Korea Making Big Bucks On Cyberattacks The UN monitors, citing data from blockchain research firms, further revealed that North Korea has likely conducted a total of 97 cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies since 2017, netting an estimated $4 billion. This year alone, North Korean hackers are suspected to be behind a dozen crypto thefts worth around $55 million. Experts believe these attacks are often carried out by skilled DPRK (Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea) IT workers employed by unsuspecting small crypto firms, granting them insider access to exploit vulnerabilities. Global Crackdown On Tornado Cash: A Step In The Right Direction? The international community has not turned a blind eye to these illicit activities. The US government sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, labeling it a money-laundering tool frequently used by North Korean cybercriminals. This action complemented broader efforts to regulate digital platforms susceptible to financial fraud. The recent sentencing of Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev to 64 months in prison by a Dutch court further highlights the tightening grip on such platforms. However, the case also exposes the complexities of regulating cryptocurrencies, a decentralized technology that transcends national borders. International cooperation and coordinated efforts are crucial to tackle this challenge effectively. Looking Ahead: Securing The Future Of Crypto The North Korean cryptocurrency laundering case serves as a wake-up call. It underscores the urgent need for a multi-pronged approach to tackle the issue.

Malaysia-based digital business solutions provider Cuscapi announced the move that its associate company MX Global received the approval on May 9, to facilitate trading of WLD token. In March 2022, MX Global had obtained an unspecified equity investment from cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Some of the permitted cryptos include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL). The news arrives a month after Worldcoin executives met with top Malaysian officials, discussing the token\u2019s strategic expansion. Alex Blania, the lead developer of Worldcoin and the co-founder and CEO of Tools of Humanity attended the meeting with key Malaysian government leaders. Before the physical meeting, both Blania and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had a 30-minute virtual discussion via video conference with the Malaysian government.

ChatGPT sets XRP price for late December 2024 Upon analyzing the recent crypto market trends and XRP-related happenings, ChatGPT concluded that the token is likely to see a significant rise in value through the rest of 2024. According to the AI, the facts that a victory for Ripple is in the cards and that the company has actively been working on developing its ecosystem and partnerships are likely to help drive positive market action. ChatGPT, however, also reflected on mixed results of technical Analysis (TA) assessing XRP\u2019s recent performance and thus concluded that, between the likely positive developments and the current struggles, the token is likely to rise to $0.80 by the end of the year. ChatGPT summarizes its assessment of XRP. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT When challenged that its Analysis appears low given that the AI assumed a legal victory for Ripple, ChatGPT pushed back, stating that the current market conditions \u2013 while allowing for a greater long-term surge \u2013 would still limit how much XRP can rise before 2024 is out and described its target of $0.80 as a \u2018conservative but realistic estimate.\u2019 ChatGPT defends its original estimate. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT ChatGPT presents a bullish scenario ChatGPT was also willing to indulge in a more bullish sequence of events. In this scenario, a legal victory against the SEC would have a ripple effect that would cause wider user and institutional adoption across the globe, facilitate an unprecedented pace of innovation, and turn the market highly bullish. Should such regulatory clarity be achieved, and should the stars align \u2013 a scenario the AI considers plausible, if not the most likely \u2013 XRP could soar to $3 per token by the end of 2024. ChatGPT outlines its bullish case for XRP. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT ChatGPT presents a bearish scenario ChatGPT, however, also estimates a bearish scenario in which Ripple suffers a major legal defeat against the SEC is plausible. Under these circumstances, the AI assesses, regulators across the world would feel emboldened to besiege the crypto industry and investors could, spooked by the developments, turn sour on cryptocurrencies.

The DOGE price drop comes after a meme coin market surge ignited by the reappearance of Roaring Kitty, a personality at the center of the meme stock craze and GameStop short squeeze back in 2021. pic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS \u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024 After an almost 3-year hiatus, he reappeared online and posted a cryptic tweet yesterday. Many believe the post signaled the analyst\u2019s return and led to speculation of a possible GameStop 2.0. The Dogecoin Price Loses Key Support 4-hour chart for DOGE/USD (Source: GeckoTerminal) The Dogecoin price lost the key support at $0.1470 over the past 24 hours. As such, bulls are trying their best to push the meme coin\u2019s price back above this key point. Should DOGE close a 4-hour candle above $0.1470 within the next 8 hours, traders might enter into a long position for the crypto. The crypto could subsequently climb to the major $0.1575 resistance level. Traders and investors will want to keep an eye on how the Dogecoin price behaves should it reach the $0.1575 barrier. In the last couple of days, the meme coin has been rejected by this technical obstacle twice already, and history could repeat itself. However, a break above $0.1575 could lead to DOGE climbing in the short term, with bulls potentially looking to capitalize on the break above this threshold. On the other hand, the Dogecoin price failing to close a 4-hour candle above $0.1470 within the next 8 hours might invalidate the bullish thesis. In this alternative scenario, the altcoin could test the immediate $0.1344 support. It might even drop below this technical crutch to $0.1224 if the sell pressure persists. Technicals Point To A Continued Drop For The Dogecoin Price Technical indicators on DOGE\u2019s 4-hour chart warn that the Dogecoin price might enter a negative cycle in the next 24 hours. There is also a major bearish technical flag that is on the verge of being triggered by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. With the MACD line collapsing towards the MACD Signal line, it seems DOGE\u2019s positive momentum during the past 24 hours has hit a peak. Should the MACD cross below the Signal line, it will most likely indicate that the meme coin\u2019s bullish phase has ended and DOGE has started a new bearish cycle. In addition to this, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator shows that bulls\u2019 strength against sellers has dropped substantially. In the last 24 hours, the RSI line has fallen from 59 to just above 50. Although this signals that DOGE can still go either way, this coupled with the MACD suggests the Dogecoin price might drop in the next 24 hours. As DOGE\u2019s momentum seems to be fizzling out, investors are shifting focus to Dogeverse, one of the best performing ICOs this year that\u2019s already raised more than $15 million. Now it\u2019s giving investors one last chance to buy before launch. Modernizing The Meme Coin Sector There is a big push in the blockchain space to find a way to make networks seamlessly communicate with each other and share information with other blockchains regardless of their differing protocols. Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) is the first meme coin to reside on multiple blockchains. This aligns the crypto perfectly with the broader industry\u2019s aim to increase interoperability within the Web3 sector. By holding Dogeverse, investors can shift value across the most liquid and active networks with ease, allowing them to participate in high yield generating opportunities as soon as they appear. What\u2019s more, Dogeverse holders won\u2019t even have to swap out their tokens to start earning passive rewards on-chain, because the project is offering ICO investors a lucrative staking program with a 57% APY. Given Dogeverse\u2019s unprecedented levels of utility, it\u2019s easy to see why an analyst from the CryptoNews YouTube channel recently said the meme coin has 100X potential on launch. One small step for man, one giant leap for multi-chain. 🌕#Memecoins #Solana #Altcoins #Ethereum #Crypto #MemeCoinSeason2024 #Web3 pic.twitter.com/bbKMU5qtA4 \u2014 DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) May 14, 2024 To acquire the token before it\u2019s too late, investors can navigate to the project\u2019s website and make use of the simple buy widget embedded on the page. Due to its multi-chain nature, investors can purchase DOGEVERSE using either ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, SOL, or BASE. USDT and bank cards can also be used. But anyone that wants to stake their tokens for the 57% APY will need to use ETH to buy the crypto, since the staking contract is on the Ethereum blockchain.

When Veo was unveiled at the Google I/O developer conference, it was recognized as a strong rival to OpenAI\u2019s Sora, the advantages of which include the expansion of creative control and the generation of stunning visual output. Veo creativity in video generation Unlike past AI video generators, Veo has an unbeatable feature, creative control; the users can make a video with finer details and the effect of the movie. With the use of its sophisticated natural language understanding, Veo can easily understand longer prompts and the meaning of cinematic terms, including \u201ctimelapse\u201d and \u201caerial shots. This deeper understanding of the concept helps users to describe their ideas in a way that is accurate and precise; thus, the videos created have a better chance of being more impressive than their counterparts. One of the most remarkable elements of Veo\u2019s is the guarantee of the continuity and the authenticity of the scenes being generated. In video generation, the problem of the inconsistency of the shots is being tackled by Veo, and it manages to produce the shots with natural movements, be it of people, animals, or objects. This note-worthy skill improves the total viewing experience, and thus, the audience feels that they are in the reality that is completely and authentically rendered scenes. Google\u2019s continuous innovation in AI video generation The Veo, Google\u2019s video generation, results from the past years of research and development in the field. The basics of the project are already being developed by the projects before Veo, such as Imagen-Video, VideoPoet, and Lumiere. Veo will go further than previously possible with AI\u2019s help in visual storytelling. By combining the lessons learned and the new ideas from these projects, Veo will become an example of Google\u2019s dedication to the best AI technology. Although the Veo presentation has already been done, it is not yet presented to the public. On the contrary, Google is providing the Veo video assistant to a limited number of VideoFX creators in VideoFX, its video editing platform. Those who are really into this can sign up for the waitlist and get a chance to be a part of the Veo experience and use its revolutionary potential. Next to Veo, Google has also presented Imagen 3, its newest text-to-image model known for its excellent image quality and fewer visual artifacts.,. The creators who are keen to know the possibilities of Imagen 3 can register for the waitlist and thus get access to this latest technology.","article_summary":"Google has announced its latest breakthrough in artificial intelligence: See, a new, innovative text-to-video generator that is about to change the video generator industry.

According to Shibariumscan, the gas fees, paid using BONE\u2014the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem\u2014escalated from 11.57 to 30.98 BONE. This increase is primarily due to a surge in network activity, likely driven by a growing interest in Shiba Inu tokens following recent market shifts. The Shiba Inu ecosystem, which uses BONE for transaction fees, is experiencing heightened transaction volumes. As a result, the cost for users has significantly increased. BONE not only facilitates transaction payments on Shibarium but also plays a key role in the ecosystem\u2019s tokenomics. READ MORE: SEC Denies Coinbase\u2019s Appeal in Ongoing Securities Lawsuit, Citing Manipulation of Legal Queries Each transaction using BONE helps in burning SHIB tokens, as a portion of the BONE fee is converted into SHIB and sent to a dead wallet. This process reduces the total SHIB supply, potentially enhancing its scarcity and value. This notable increase in fees raises several questions about the future of the Shiba Inu network and its tokens. Stakeholders are now contemplating whether the spike is indicative of a long-term trend of increased activity or if it\u2019s a temporary surge. The sustainability of such high fees is also in question, as is Shibarium\u2019s strategy to manage demand while maintaining network efficiency and scalability. Additionally, the broader context includes recent integrations that have enabled Shiba Inu (SHIB) payments with major brands like Airbnb and Nike, expanding the token\u2019s utility and exposure. However, the overall market sentiment remains bearish, creating an uncertain environment for SHIB and BONE investors. These developments suggest critical times ahead for Shibarium, as it must navigate through market fluctuations and user expectations to sustain growth and retain user engagement.

If sellers manage to breach the lower end of DOT\u2019s trading range, the bearish trend could persist for the foreseeable future, a scenario that investors should be cautious about. Polkadot (DOT) Continues To See Red Looking at the Polkadot (DOT) price chart, we observe a bullish trend at the beginning of the month that saw the price rise to $7.27 and sit above the 20 and 200-day SMAs. However, the price faced consistent rejections at this level and dropped below the 200-day SMA on May 6. A further drop on May 7 saw the DOT price drop to $6.99, a level where the 20-day SMA acted as support. After a brief recovery that saw DOT climb back above $7, before bearish sentiment saw the price tumble by 4.43% on May 10, and drop below the 20-day SMA. While DOT\u2019s lateral movement was indicative of an ongoing consolidation, the recent drop (May 10) indicates a strengthening of the bearish sentiment. Since this drop, DOT has remained in the red on May 11 and 12, settling at $6.62. The current week began with a volatile day, which saw DOT drop to a low of $6.41 before recovering and rising to $6.67. Tuesday saw a significant drop as sellers pushed DOT to its support level but were unable to push the price any lower. The current session has seen DOT rebound from its support level, with buyers entering the market at this point. Currently, the price is up by 1.70% and sits at $6.59. Looking Ahead Looking at the chart, we can see that DOT has strong support at $6.40, a level from where the price has shown resilience during the ongoing session. The 20-day SMA is currently acting as resistance at the $6.90 level. Despite being trapped between the $6.40 and $7 levels for over a week, there is still potential for a significant bullish movement. If DOT manages to break past the 20-day SMA, we could see the price surge to the $7.50 mark, offering a glimmer of hope for a potential recovery. However, if sellers are able to push the price below DOT\u2019s current support levels, it could unleash a cascading effect and see the price drop to $6 or even $5.5.

This view comes after analysts uncovered details from a March filing with the SEC that seem to suggest the regulator is considering labeling the largest altcoin by market cap a security. SEC Asks Public If BlackRock\u2019s Ethereum ETF Can Be Filed As A Commodity Davis Polk and Wardwell Associate Scott Johnsson analyzed a March 4 filing from leading asset manager BlackRock to list its spot ETH ETF on Nasdaq. In addition to delaying the deadline for the SEC to deliver a decision on BlackRock\u2019s application until June, it also called for public feedback on whether the fund could be filed as a commodity. I'm aware this is widely considered a possibility, but this is your official notice that the SEC is considering the security question for ETH in this upcoming spot ETF order. Note that this question was never (afaict) asked regarding a spot/futures BTC ETF product. pic.twitter.com/TwhqmTnJfC \u2014 Scott Johnsson (@SGJohnsson) May 14, 2024 The question was never asked in the run up to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to Johnsson. The regulator can \u201cdeny on the basis that these spot filings are improperly filed as commodity based trust shares,\u201d Johnsson said on X. This would mean that the funds \u201cdo not qualify if they are holding a security.\u201d The SEC is perhaps considering Ethereum as \u201ca security in their denial,\u201d added senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in a May 14 X post. \u201cIt was literally buried 50 feet deep in a pile of legalese.\u201d SEC Likely Considering Labeling ETH A Security Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the filing increases the odds of a denial, adding that the request for public feedback \u201calmost guarantees\u201d that the regulator is considering labeling ETH a security. Looks like odds just went up for SEC to deny Ethereum ETFs by claiming #Ethereum is a security. Not a guarantee that they will do this but i think this almost guarantees that the SEC is at least considering it.
