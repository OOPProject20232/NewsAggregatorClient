    "article_detailed_content": "Equation is a decentralized perpetual contract built on Arbitrum. It implies a BRMM model and allows up to 200x leverage to traders and Liquidity Providers Equation is the new term in decentralized finance (DeFi), leading to significant development in perpetual trading. DeFi has experienced remarkable growth since the emergence of automated market makers (AMMs) like Uniswap in the spot market. The trading volume for the spot market is much less than that of centralized exchanges for perpetual contracts. There is no equivalent growth for AMMs tailored for perpetual. To overcome this difference, Equation introduced the innovative Balance Rate Market Maker (BRMM) model, building a new structure of perpetual trading to reduce the gap between spot and perpetual markets. It is a revolutionary model that offers liquidity providers and traders a significant leverage limit of 200x. It redefines the possibilities for traders while improving capital efficiency for liquidity providers. Equation shapes the future of DeFi with its trailblazing approach to perpetual trading through fairness, security, and community-driven innovation. Equation V2, launched in December 2023, refines this algorithm, further improving market-making efficiency and the risk-hedging capabilities for liquidity providers (LPs) while eliminating the Risk Buffer Fund. Improvements in Equation V2 Precise Passive Position for Liquidity Providers LPs added liquidity corresponds one-to-one with passively held positions. It allows every liquidity provider to know the size of their holdings and the risks in real time. This development will enable LPs to hedge risks more accurately and support their expansion into various market-making strategies. As a result of this upgrade, Equation can theoretically support any asset with an Oracle price. Multiple fees and leverage tiers The beginning setup introduced three default fee levels, which include 0.02% for 100x leverage, 0.04% for 50x leverage, and 0.01% for 20x leverage. This default fee structure ensures liquidity providers (LPs) are adequately compensated for assuming different levels of risk. Moreover, it sets the groundwork for future market creation for any token. The risk Buffer Fund (RBF) is eliminated. RBF was introduced in Equation v1 to protect LPs from substantial losses. However, it had significant drawbacks, such as contributing to the RBF’s liquidity; it could not hedge risks, and LPs were highly protected. LPs mainly were from the highest leverage state. It led to an imbalance in the overall system of risk control. Now, Equation V2 significantly improves the risk control ability of LPs. The additional protection. The risk buffer fund offered was no longer needed. They have also made some adjustments and optimized other aspects of the algorithm to complement the achievement of the upgrade goals. Importance of Liquidity Providers In the BRMM model, liquidity providers act as temporary parties to traders: When users liquidate, open, or close positions, LPs open or close positions of the same size as those in the opposite direction. The proportions of LPs held in passive positions are relative to the total positions of all LPs, and the proportion of liquidity they provide about the local liquidity of all LPs is always maintained in equivalence. Sources of income for LPs include: A part of the users’ trading fees. LPs consistently earn funding fees from the passive positions they hold. Liquidity mining. If the LPs’ held passive positions have a positive PnL, the LPs earn additional profits in addition to the above-mentioned fixed income sources. Risks for Liquidity providers They face risk in their net position when they hold passive positions.

    "article_detailed_content": "Looking to capitalize on your investment in crypto this year? You are at the right place. Read further to see six cryptos you should consider for your investment portfolio. Six Cryptos That Could Turn $5,000 into $500,000 in 2024 – Overview – Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20) – Slothana ($SLOTH) – Sponge V2 ($SPONGEV2) – SMOG Token ($SMOG) – 5th Space ($5SPACE) – Bitcoin ($BTC) Here is more about them. >>>Buy the Best Crypto Now!<<< Dogecoin20 is the best crypto to buy now! If you want to invest in only one crypto project this year, let it be Dogecoin20. This crypto meme project is a greener and more eco-friendly version of Dogecoin. The project is on Ethereum, offering faster transactions and less energy consumption. Dogecoin20 is on presale and has so far raised over $10 million in funding. On April 20th, Dogecoin will go live, and investors will claim their tokens. As you probably know, April 20th is Doge Day, and this way, Dogecoin20 pays homage to the project. Moreover, Dogecoin20 wants to celebrate this day with investors. Dogecoin20 uses the power of Ethereum smart contracts, breaking away from traditional meme norms and bringing utility to investors. Thanks to the staking platform, you get an APY of 63% when you keep your coins. The project encourages community engagement, wanting them to contribute to the network’s stability, security, and growth. Further, while Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, Dogecoin20 has a limited supply of 140 million tokens. It means the $DOGE20 price is controlled, paving the way for massive upward price movements. Since its release, Dogecoin20 has been praised by the whole crypto community. The project is at the 5th place among the most anticipated crypto launches. Jacob Bury says Dogeoin20 is the next 100x potential meme coin. Dogecoin20 price predictions say this meme crypto will hit $0.000412 by the end of the year. By 2025, $DOGE20 could trade at $0.001 and $0.005 by 2030. Dogecoin20 could follow the path of Bonk, dogwifhat, and Bome and become the top-trading meme project. So, if you want to get $50,000 from your $5,000 investment, hurry and buy Dogecoin20 now. >>>Buy Dogecoin20 Now<<< Slothana is the best Solana-based meme crypto Slothana, a new Solana meme coin, has been smashing through its presale. In the first eight hours of the presale, $SLOTH raised $500k in funding. Slothana raised over $2.1 million in funding in the first three days. The project is now over the $7.5 million threshold, rapidly moving through the presale stages. Slothana’s presale is different from ICOs of any other crypto. To join and get $SLOTH, you must send Solana coins to a designated wallet address. For every $SOL coin you send, you receive 10,000 $SLOTH coins. The tokens will land in your wallet when the presale ends. Keep an eye on Slothana’s X account for more updates. According to analysts, Slothana is poised for a 1200% surge, following the footsteps of other Solana meme coins, $BOME and $SLERF. Solana meme coins have surged recently, becoming among the most successful meme projects. Slothana presents a compelling investment opportunity for investors, offering the potential for substantial returns. Experts await 100x from Slothana after the CEX listings. This meme crypto eyes the CEX listings. However, the Slothana community wants to see the project on both CEXs and DEXs. Slothana price predictions say this meme crypto will trade at $0.16 in 2024, $0.35 in 2025, and $0.8 by 2030. Analysts expect Slothana to follow $BOME’s success and create new millionaires. X account LookOnChain says many Book of Meme investors made between seven and eight figures from their five-figure investments. However, $BOME ICO raised only $2 million, while the $SLOTH’s already hit $6 million. So, if you want $50,000 from a $5,000 investment, Slothana could be a great pick. >>>Buy Slothana Now!<<< Sponge V2 could bring you 100x ROI Since its release, Sponge V2 has become among the best Polygon projects of the year. The upgraded version of SpongeBob Token made headlines when it pumped 50% in 24 hours in March. That is when the project hit its all-time high price of $0.0034. This top community crypto brings utility to the game, offering lucrative rewards to investors. When you stake your tokens, you earn an APY of 168% on Ethereum and 371% on Polygon. Further, Sponge V2 will offer investors a Play 2 Earn game. The game will give investors a chance to earn additional $SPONGE tokens. If you are not ready to commit, Sponge V2 will offer the free version of the game. You can test it before investing. Sponge V2 has collected over 9.6 billion staked coins, with over $20 million in value. Compared with SpongeBob Token, Sponge V2 will launch at better exchanges. Names like Binance and OKX are often mentioned as exchanges that will offer Sponge V2. That, combined with utility, should push $SPONGEV2 to new heights. According to the price predictions, $SPONGEV2 will hit $0.0035 in 2024. The project is already near this price, which means $SPONGEV2 could go even further. Mid-term and long-term predictions show that $SPONGEV2 could hit $0.0075 in 2025 and $0.011 by 2030. If this were to happen, Sponge V2 could gain 75x compared to today’s price. Further, ChatGPT predicts a 500% gain for Sponge V2 in 2024. Its prediction says $SPONGEV2 could hit $0.1 this year! According to many experts, Sponge V2 has a strong potential to turn $5,000 into $50,000 in 2024. Jacob Bury thinks this could be the top altcoin to invest in, while Oscar Ramos predicts 100x yields for early $SPONGEV2 investors. So, if you want to invest in this top community token, hurry and get it before it’s too late. >>> Buy $SPONGEV2 Now<< SMOG Token is the highlight of the year After finalizing the first season of its airdrop, SMOG Token is ready to list on the first exchanges. This Solana meme coin will list on MEXC on April 4th, but experts suggest new listings should come soon. The date coincided with the start of the Season 2 of the largest Solana airdrop ever. The project recently hit some crucial milestones. The SMOG community has over 110,000 holders who have completed over 8.2 million quests. Since its launch, SMOG Token has been listed among the best projects to buy. The project attracted thousands of investors who wanted to join the biggest airdrop on the network and earn massive ROI. If you stake your $SMOG coins, you can earn 42% gains. Further, you can earn massively with the price changes. SMOG Token price predictions are terrific, saying $SMOG will reach $0.15 by the end of the year. In 2025, $SMOG could go up and trade at $0.3. By the decade’s end, SMOG Token should trade at $0.7. The recovery of meme coins in 2024 will play a crucial role in $SMOG’s growth. So, if you want to invest in this project, hurry. You can still get it with a 10% discount when you buy $SMOG from the official website. That’s your chance to join the biggest airdrop on the Solana network and earn massively. CoinMarketCap claims SMOG Token will go up by 10x after the CEX listings. Crypto expert Franklin Emmanuel also names it among the best meme coins ever. Lastly, Jacob Bury thinks this is the next meme coin to explode in 2024. And your $5,000 could turn to $50,000 easily if you buy SMOG Token now! >>>Buy SMOG Token Now!<<< 5th Scape could take the world by storm 5th Scape is a VR project with a massive potential to overcome Bitcoin, Ripple, and Solana in 2024, per CoinMarketCap. It is the combination of VR and AR, reshaping Web3. The project prioritizes gaming instead of hype, delivering a gaming experience like no other. 5th Scape brings you games, movies, education, and devices in virtual reality. The games vary from battles and archery to racing while offering better visuals, audio, themes, motion, transactions, and payments. The project includes equipment. In particular, the VR ultra headset is among the best innovations on the market. It is offering an immersive experience while gaming, exploring, or learning. Further, the SwiftScape VR Chair lets you stay comfortable while exploring the 5th Scape. Beyond this, 5th Scape also offers lucrative staking rewards. You can stake your $5SCAPE coins and earn rewards through active participation in the project. All presale purchases will stay locked and have a vesting schedule. Out of the sum, 40% of tokens will be released at the 5SCAPE token generation event. The remaining 60% will stay locked for eight weeks. 5th Scape price predictions predict a terrific future for this crypto. The forecasts say $5SCAPE will trade at $0.0135 in 2024, $0.0225 in 2025, and $0.028 by the end of the decade. 5th Scape ICO also sees massive support. The project has so far raised over $3.7 million in its presale. If you decide to invest now, you can get this project at a 303% lower price than the scheduled listing price! Famous crypto analyst Michael Vrubel says massive gains could be at play for all 5th Scape investors. Decrypt Crypto also claims the 5th Scape could be the next 100x crypto. So, if you want to invest, hurry to the website and get 5th Scape now! >>>Buy 5th Scape Now<<< Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024 If you ask us, Bitcoin is always a clever investment decision, especially in 2024. The long-awaited halving could push the $BTC price up massively. Since the start of this year, Bitcoin has been on an upward trajectory. It looks ready to set a new all-time high record. Although Bitcoin recently dipped $5,000, analysts suggest April could be the best month for Bitcoin ever. Historically, the highest demand for $BTC happens nine months after the halving. It means $BTC could surge toward the end of the year. Bitcoin price predictions say $BTC could hit $100k in 2024. According to the data from Coincodex, Bitcoin could hit as high as $158,983 in 2025. By the decade’s end, the largest crypto could cross the $300k mark and trade at $305,028. Bitcoin is, however, known for its volatility and massive dips, which caused multiple losses for investors before. Despite this, it is still a terrific investment and a popular choice for investors who want to turn $5,000 to $50,000. Final Thoughts. What are the best investment options for $50,000 in 2024? You will agree that Bitcoin is always a good investment choice. But big investments and potential gains often mean huge risks, especially in $BTC’s case. The truth is, investing $1 in Bitcoin will not make any difference because you need to invest more to gain more. But when you invest lots of money, there is a chance you could also lose a lot. That is, however, not the case with smaller projects like Dogecoin20, Slothana, Sponge V2, SMOG Token, or 5th Scape. A smaller investment, in this case, could mean terrific ROI for you and smaller risks of losing your money. So, we suggest you invest in these five cryptos if you want to get $50,000 from your $5,000 investment.

    "article_detailed_content": "Established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to hold significant weight in the crypto sphere. However, innovative projects are emerging and showing the potential to disrupt entire industries. This month, we’ll explore two promising contenders – Scorpion Casino (SCORP) and Pepe Fork (PORK). We will delve into their potential for high returns on investment (ROI). The Integration of Blockchain Technology in Scorpion Casino’s Online Gaming Platform Scorpion Casino distinguishes itself through its innovative approach to online gaming. The platform integrates blockchain technology and utilizes its native token, SCORP, to facilitate secure and transparent gameplay. In contrast to meme coins focused primarily on hype, SCORP offers tangible benefits within the Scorpion Casino ecosystem. Players leverage SCORP for in-game transactions, participate in provably fair games, and receive transparent payouts. This focus on real-world applications positions Scorpion Casino for sustained growth. Early investors have the potential to benefit significantly from the project’s success. The ongoing presale provides an opportunity to acquire SCORP tokens at a potentially discounted price. Their price can increase with listing on major exchanges. This early investment could result in substantial returns if the project experiences widespread adoption. Scorpion Casino’s dedication to continuous improvement extends to its offerings. Along with daily passive staking income and collaborations with leading iGaming developers, the platform aims to create an unparalleled gaming experience. The platform’s unique buy-back, burn, and reward distribution system exemplifies its focus on maximizing benefits for $SCORP holders. Its generous prizes for players are already drawing gaming enthusiasts. Furthermore, the upcoming listing on the LBank exchange signifies a significant step towards greater exposure and user accessibility. It is solidifying Scorpion Casino’s appeal to investors seeking high returns. PepeFork (PORK): A New Meme Token Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is currently the fifth-largest meme coin, with a market capitalization exceeding $380 million. The well-known Pepe the Frog meme Inspired PEPE name coin creators. A new meme token, Pepe Fork, has emerged as a fork of that world-famous Pepe meme coin. Despite its recent launch, PORK has sparked considerable interest. It reached a market capitalization of $200 million within two days. This accomplishment positions PORK as the ninth-largest meme coin, surpassing Baby DogeCoin. PepeFork (PORK) stands out for its expedited listings on major platforms. These include Coin Market Cap, CoinGecko, LBank, and MEXC. Thus signifying a record-breaking pace for new project recognition. This strategic move emphasizes PepeFork’s focus on transparency and user accessibility, a stark contrast to the controversies that led to its launch. Furthermore, PepeFork offers direct integration with the Pond0x ecosystem. What Distinguishes Scorpion Casino From Pepe Fork? A key advantage of investing in Scorpion Casino lies in its profit-sharing model. This unique approach allows token holders to receive a daily share of the platform’s profits. They get a novel method for generating passive income. As the token launch nears on April 15th and the presale shows promise of selling out entirely, SCORP positions itself as an attractive investment for those seeking to merge gaming enjoyment with potential financial gains. Scorpion Casino and Pepe Fork offer contrasting approaches to the cryptocurrency landscape. Scorpion Casino prioritizes real-world utility within the online gaming industry, while Pepe Fork caters to meme coin enthusiasts. Both projects have the potential for high ROIs. Given its reputation, robust features, and valuable partnerships, Scorpion Casino stands out as a frontrunner. It has the potential to deliver massive ROIs this month.

Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR stands as the eco-friendly digital currency of the Hedera public ledger. Utilized for settling app-related fees and fortifying the network via a stake-based validation system, HBAR’s total circulation is capped at 50 billion units, with availability across multiple trading platforms. Its symbol is represented by a stylized lowercase ‘ℏ’. Within the network, HBAR facilitates various operations, including HBAR transfers, creation of both fungible and unique digital assets, execution of smart contracts, and data storage. Hedera’s network, anchored by the hashgraph consensus, delivers top-tier security (ABFT), exceptional speed in transactions, and minimal bandwidth usage. Transactions with HBAR are confirmed on the ledger in just 3 to 5 seconds. The network boasts a capacity of 10,000 HBAR transactions each second, at nominal costs of roughly $0.0001. By staking HBAR on a Hedera node, users can potentially earn up to 6.5% APY, contributing to the robustness of Hedera’s operational security. Technical Analysis of Hedera Hashgraph Crypto Track all markets on TradingView Hedera Hashgraph crypto price has been on a downtrend for the past three weeks, as it faced resistance from the higher levels and formed lower lows. This shows that the bears have been in control and the crypto has lost momentum. The crypto has also broken below the key moving averages, indicating weakness. The cryptocurrency market has seen a recent downturn, with Hedera Hashgraph’s USD value (HBAR) falling back to its previous breakout level. This level may serve as a support, as technical analysis suggests that the crypto is currently oversold and could rebound from this low point. However, it is important to note that the crypto must demonstrate signs of strength and reversal before confirming any upward trend. Until then, it remains to be seen whether there will be a rally or a continued decline. Hedera Hashgraph crypto (USD:HBAR) price is in a correction phase but is trading near crucial support levels.

Summary Hedera Hashgraph crypto has shown sellers’ strength on the technical charts. Moreover, the price traded below the key EMAs, which shows further weakness in the crypto. The RSI curve is near the neutral region at 44, and a negative outlook was noted, indicating bearishness in the crypto.

    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin’s subtle dip to $67,800 on Saturday stirs speculation, spotlighting our Bitcoin price prediction: could we see it soar to $70,000 soon? This question gains weight as Genesis injects $2.1 billion into Bitcoin, counterbalancing market tremors and signaling robust confidence in its future. With major financial players like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs now navigating the Bitcoin ETF sphere, the stage is set for an intriguing market trajectory. Genesis Acquires $2.1 Billion in Bitcoin Amid Market Shake-Up Genesis, a cryptocurrency lending firm facing insolvency, sold approximately 36 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to buy $2.1 billion in Bitcoin, aiming to settle debts with creditors. This transaction occurred on April 2, coinciding with Bitcoin’s value at $65,685 each. Despite initially impacting market prices negatively, this move and the use of Bitcoin for creditor repayment have likely contributed to market stabilization. Big Move in the Crypto World: Genesis Sells $GBTC Shares for Bitcoin #Genesis Trading has taken a major step in their bankruptcy process by converting GBTC shares into 32,041 BTC (yes, you read that right!), valued at $2.1 billion over the past three weeks. Here's the… pic.twitter.com/wnXC377725 — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) April 6, 2024 Coinbase assured that much of the funds would remain in the crypto ecosystem, mitigating potential adverse market effects. Genesis trades GBTC shares for Bitcoin to pay creditors. Market impact leads to temporary Bitcoin price drop. Coinbase ensures most funds stay in the crypto market, aiding stability. India Expands Digital Rupee Reach: Central Bank’s Digital Wallets Through Non-Bank Operators The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to enhance digital currency accessibility by allowing non-bank payment system operators to offer wallets for the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Detailed in the “Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,” this initiative aims to broaden CBDC distribution through pilot programs in retail and wholesale sectors, signaling India’s commitment to digital currency evolution and public CBDC adoption. India retail CBDC Digital Rupee (e₹) scale-up through non-banking institutions.#rbipolicy #RBI #rbigovernor #CBDCs #india @RBI @rbinnovationhub @NPCI_NPCI @_DigitalIndia @Ind_Block_Forum @LoharPrasanna @spydra_io pic.twitter.com/JKh5T5bSUw — Kamlesh Nagware (@KNagware) April 6, 2024 Despite the ongoing regulatory ambiguities surrounding cryptocurrencies, as highlighted by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s stance that they are not legal tender, this move towards establishing CBDC infrastructure suggests a proactive shift in the government’s digital asset strategy. However, the rise of CBDCs could introduce competition for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s adoption and market behavior in India. Major Financial Firms Dive into Bitcoin ETF as Blackrock’s IBIT Grows Blackrock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now includes nine approved participants like JPMorgan Securities, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup, showcasing growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. The ability to manage 40,000 share baskets in IBIT signifies a bullish trend. Since its inception in January, IBIT has accumulated about 260,000 BTC. Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s optimistic view on Bitcoin underscores institutional confidence, potentially boosting BTC’s market presence and price stability. Key institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs back IBIT. Blackrock holds approximately 260,000 BTC, indicating strong market interest. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin’s pivot point stands at $67,700, with potential resistance levels at $69,850, $71,600, and $73,765. Conversely, support is identified at $65,585, descending to $63,500 and $61,530. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 53, coupled with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) closely aligned at $67,804, suggests a balanced but vigilant market stance. Bitcoin’s current trajectory is bullish above $67,700, yet a fall below this crucial juncture could precipitate a notable sell-off.

    "article_detailed_content": "Bonk (BONK) has seen a notable decline of 4% overnight, stirring interest in its market dynamics and leading to speculations about potential dip-buying opportunities. This Bonk price prediction hinges on its current trading status at $0.000023 and recent activities, including a 4.20% increase in the last 24 hours and a hefty trading volume that positions it 71st on CoinMarketCap, with a robust market cap of $1.475 billion. Bonk Price Prediction The technical landscape for Bonk shows a pivot point at $0.000021, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. Immediate resistance levels are identified at $0.000024, $0.000026, and $0.000028, with support levels at $0.000020, $0.000018, and $0.000016 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44 suggests that Bonk is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for upward movement. Further technical analysis reveals a double bottom pattern, offering strong support around $0.000021. This pattern, coupled with bullish candlestick formations, hints at a potential uptick in buying activity. The 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), currently at $0.000024, aligns with this bullish sentiment, reinforcing the support level. The conclusion from these technical indicators is that Bonk exhibits a bullish trend above the $0.000021 level. However, traders should be cautious, as a drop below this threshold could lead to a sharp decline in price. The interplay between the RSI and 50 EMA suggests a buying trend might be underway, supported by the chart patterns and current price movement. In summary, while Bonk’s current performance indicates a bullish stance, market participants should monitor these key price levels and technical indicators closely.

    "article_detailed_content": "Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, have been found guilty of fraud in a civil case brought against them by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The jury in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York delivered the verdict in federal court after a two-week trial after hearing closing arguments earlier in the day, according to an official announcement. The SEC alleged that Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Kwon, deceived investors regarding the stability of their crypto asset security and algorithmic stablecoin called Terra USD. Furthermore, they were accused of misleading investors about whether Terraform’s blockchain was used by a popular payment application for processing and settling payments. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud,” said SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal. “Terraform Labs and Kwon, its former CEO, deceived investors about the stability of the crypto asset security and so-called algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD, and they further misled investors about whether a popular payment application used Terraform’s blockchain to process and settle payments.” SEC Attorneys Liken Terraform Labs to “House of Cards” Throughout the trial, SEC attorneys likened the platform to a “house of cards” and alleged that the company and Kwon had lied to investors. According to the verdict filed on April 5, the jury found Kwon and Terraform Labs liable for six charges. Additionally, they determined that the platform had acted recklessly by making false or misleading statements regarding the offer or sale of TerraUSD (UST), Luna, or wLUNA. Today, after a nine-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found Terraform Labs PTE Ltd. & Do Kwon liable for defrauding investors in crypto asset securities. More: https://t.co/dRtq3ITGMG pic.twitter.com/kwlpKXxv6r — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) April 5, 2024 The collapse of Terraform Labs occurred in May 2022, following the instability of its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, and other concerns surrounding the blockchain’s use cases. This collapse had significant implications for the crypto market, contributing to a major downturn and leading to bankruptcy filings from prominent firms such as FTX, BlockFi, and Celsius. The SEC filed its lawsuit against Terraform and Kwon in February 2023, accusing them of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud. In December, Judge Jed Rakoff granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Terraform regarding the unregistered offer and sale of security-based swaps. Do Kwon’s Extradition Case Sent Back To Lower Court Meanwhile, the impact of the verdict on Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro remains uncertain. Just recently, Montenegro’s Supreme Court said it had approved the protection of legality of a prior decision from a lower court approving Kwon’s extradition to South Korea. Both the United States and South Korea have filed competing claims for Kwon’s extradition, with Montenegro now juggling whose claim to prioritize. Kwon’s legal team is pushing for extradition to South Korea first, where analysts expect he’ll be given a lighter sentence. Prosecutors claimed the appellate court had violated procedure by rejecting an appeal from Kwon’s legal team on the matter, and instead putting the decision in the Supreme Court’s hands. The Supreme Court, however, said decisions of this sort are not its responsibility. The post Terraform Labs and Co-Founder Do Kwon Found Guilty of Fraud in SEC Case appeared first on Cryptonews.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Dogecoin Investors Shift Focus to Exciting New Meme Coin, Hunting for 1000% Returns / Source: Cryptonews As Dogecoin (DOGE) consolidates close to its 21DMA at $0.18 after having pulled back over 20% from last month’s highs, Dogecoin investors are shifting focus to an exciting new meme coin called Sponge (SPONGE) as they hunt for 1,000% returns. Dogecoin remains the undisputed king of the crypto meme coins. But its monstrous market cap of last around $25.58 billion suggests the scope for further gains is somewhat limited. Sure, Dogecoin could 5x still this bull market. But many meme coin investors will be targeting higher gains, of 1,000%, or 20x or more. Such investors should search for exciting new meme coins with much lower market caps, and a lot of viral potential. A meme coin called Sponge ($SPONGE) fits this bill perfectly, after launching its V2 on Polygon earlier this year. The original Sponge token nearly hit a market cap high of $100 million last year. However, the token migrated to Polygon to make use of its lower fees and faster transactions a month ago. And the migration to Polygon has ignited a surge in the $SPONGE price. $SPONGE hit a market cap of as much as $160 million in March. It’s since fallen back to a market cap of around $80 million, offering investors the chance to buy the dip. Buy Sponge Here $SPONGE – Exciting New Meme Coin Aiming for 1000% ROI Sponge isn’t just any old utility-lacking meme coin. The exciting new meme coin offers a passive income opportunity and also functions as the native token of a play-to-earn (P2E) racing game. Sponge buyers who stake their tokens can secure yields of up to 368%, as per the official Sponge website. Milestone alert, #SPONGERS! There are now over 9.5 billion $SPONGE tokens staked with a value of $20,333,984.53! Our holders are enjoying an impressive current APY of +150%.

Meme coins like Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Pepe have shown how an upstart meme coin can reach a multi-billion-dollar market cap. The exciting new meme coin’s website is also teasing that it will soon launch on bigger and better exchanges, which could bring a wave of new buyers to $SPONGE. At just $67 million, Sponge could be looking at 1000% ROI in terms of price upside.

    "article_detailed_content": "Traders use platforms like DEXScreener to find the top crypto gainers today. Source: DEXScreener’s X Account As blue-chip cryptocurrencies nurse losses on a Friday that saw a further hawkish repricing of Fed rate cut expectations, investors looking for top crypto gainers today are turning to the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain markets for quick returns. The latest US jobs report was strong and various Fed policymakers jawboned about it being too soon for rate cuts. Bitcoin swung between $66,000 and $68,500 and was last down close to 5% for the week. Other major cryptos also nursed losses. Solana (SOL) was last down 5.5% in 24 hours, while Dogecoin (DOGE) was down 3%, as per CoinMarketCap. Rather than jumping into the bearish blue-chip market, many would prefer to bet on newly launched on-chain tokens. On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain. For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough. They are often referred to as meme coin (or shitcoin) markets and virtually anyone can issue a token at any time. As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes. But shitcoin markets are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region. Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring, as per DEXScreener. Top Crypto Gainers Today MUFFIN (MUFFIN) A just-launched shitcoin called MUFFIN (MUFFIN) is up 17,000% in 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. Despite those big gains, the token’s market cap is still very small at just $674,000. Its liquidity pool, meanwhile, has $94,000 locked. 24-hour volumes sits at a decent $1.2 million, with nearly 500 unique wallets having traded the token. DEXScreener’s smart contract audit reveals two issues with the token’s smart contract. It’s crucial that shitcoin investors always do their due diligence before investing. Else they could easily fall prey to a scam or rug pull. PRIVAGO (PVGO) A recently launched decentralized VPN protocol called Privago (PVGO) is up 4,583% in 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. The shitcoin last had a market cap of $850,000. It has seen $1.5 million in 24-hour trading volumes and has unlocked liquidity of $213,000. The Quick Intel audit of its smart contract shows a very hefty 25% sell tax on the token. So potential investors should be very careful. Graphitect Token (GPT) A just-launched shitcoin called Graphitect Token (GPT) has pumped up 2,600%, as per DEXScreener. $2.1 million in trading volumes have taken the token’s market cap to $462,000. The token also $160,000 in locked liquidity. GPT has a 5% buy and sell tax and a “whitelist”, as per Go+ Security. Traders should be very cautious investing in this coin, as it could easily still be a rug pull or scam. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

    "article_summary": "The flaw that was causing transaction failures and a delay in block finalisation in the blockchain ecosystem was \"identified and patched,\" according to Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko on April 5. The post Solana Founder Explains Reason For Network Glitch appeared first on Cryptonews.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko revealed on April 5 that the bug causing reduced functionality in the blockchain ecosystem, including transaction failures and a slowdown in block finalization, had been “identified and patched.” Yakovenko added that while the Solana network glitch is fixed, implementing other key updates may not be straightforward. Solana Network Glitch Spurts from Version 1.14 Upgrade In an X post, Yakovenko stated that dealing with bugs was more complex than keeping a network active and operational for users. “Dealing with congestion bugs sucks so much more than total liveness failure. The latter is one and done, bug is identified and patched and chain continues,” the post read. “The former has to go through the full release and test pipeline. Shipping fast is impossible.” Yakovenko’s announcement follows co-founder Raj Gokal’s post on X earlier this month, which addressed the overall concerns of the Solana chain and the deployment of world-class personnel to tackle the issues. world class engineering teams are working around the clock to push fixes to improve the experience of submitting transactions on @solana. I am messaging them multiple times a day asking how it’s going, and they tell me this is a very helpful way to contribute to the solution. — raj (@rajgokal) April 4, 2024 Since the beginning of March, the Solana network has been forced to address growing complaints regarding its ongoing transaction issues, including an estimated 77.4% failure rate. Users, developers, and other services deployed on Solana have been affected by this network glitch. Currently, 77.4 per cent of transactions on the Solana network fail and are not executed – all because of the hype around meme tokens. pic.twitter.com/GdL2B2GsSc — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) April 5, 2024 Dune Analytics data also revealed that over 70% of non-voting transactions had failed since the start of April, a notable increase from the 54% failure rate recorded in March. Meanwhile, the Solana Foundation has announced several measures and recommendations to respond to the widespread network congestion. These include Optimizing Computing Unit (CU) Usage, where developers are encouraged to specify a compute unit budget for their transactions to avoid unnecessary resource allocation and improve efficiency. The Solana team further said that a major update (v1.18) has been scheduled for April to address congestion issues and improve network performance and reliability. Solana Blockchain Network Outages Rises Solana rebounded from the aftermath of FTX’s collapse in 2022, which caused the price of its native token, SOL, to drop below $10. This was due to FTX ex-CEO Sam Bankman’s staunch support for Solana, which elicited controversy. Interestingly, the asset surpassed the $200 level threshold on March 18, 2024, and is predicted to hit its November 2021 all-time high of $260 by the end of 2024. CoinMarketCap data on SOL 1-year Market Trend The resurgence has been primarily driven by its identity as a smart contracts platform that facilitates fast and cost-effective cryptocurrency transactions – a strong alternative to the Ethereum congested ecosystem and high gas fee. Other drivers include projects deployed on the change, such as popular memecoins like Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF), which have broken into the top 50 tokens by market cap and created several crypto millionaires. These factors led to heavy congestion on the Solana network, which greatly affected the processing of crypto transactions, delays in communication between nodes, and the overall performance of the platform. According to data from blockchain expert Dagnum-PI, Solana is currently congested with an average ping time (APT) of 20-40 seconds, signaling delays in node communication. #Solana is currently congested with an Average Ping Time of 20-40s, 30-50% Ping loss, up to 50-80% failed transactions. $SOL Solana's TPS isn't 50k due to vote transactions; it's just marketing. In reality, under full network conditions with 30-50s wait times, Solana maxes out… pic.twitter.com/NJJfZGDBgo — Dagnum P.I. (@Dagnum_PI) March 17, 2024 The analyst noted a ping loss ranging from 30% to 50%, which has contributed to transaction failures and delays, and up to 50% to 80% failed transactions, which highlights critical issues with transaction processing and network stability. Dagnum-PI data further indicated that high levels of spam from memecoin activity and Miner Extractable Value (MEV) have overwhelmed Solana’s capacity, leading to blockchain network outages. Solscan March 17 data on meme coin activity As Solana’s value rises, the network’s history of outages has raised concern due to the impact of congestion, which could further complicate blockchain issues.

Recall that network congestion in October 2023 prompted liquidation and drove away users from the platform. The network also suffered downtime in February, which led to five hours of service disruption. The post Solana Founder Explains Reason For Network Glitch appeared first on Cryptonews.",

    "article_detailed_content": "A legal ruling regarding the fate of crypto mogul Do Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro was returned to a lower court on April 5. Montenegro’s Supreme Court said it had approved the protection of legality of a prior decision from a lower court approving Kwon’s extradition to South Korea. Do Kwon Extradition Left To Montenegro Court Both the United States and South Korea have filed competing claims for Kwon’s extradition, with Montenegro now juggling whose claim to prioritize. Kwon’s legal team is pushing for extradition to South Korea first, where analysts expect he’ll be given a lighter sentence. Prosecutors claimed the appellate court had violated procedure by rejecting an appeal from Kwon’s legal team on the matter, and instead putting the decision in the Supreme Court’s hands. The Supreme Court, however, said decisions of this sort are not its responsibility. “In a situation where it is a matter of competing requests from two states for the extradition of the same person, and not a conflict of requests for the extradition of the same person, as found by the lower courts, the court’s obligation is to determine, in accordance with its powers, whether the legal conditions for extradition have been met the defendant in relation to each petition individually, after which the competent minister, not the court, decides on the permission and order of priority of extradition,” its Friday ruling stated. The decision on Do Kwon’s extradition will now return to the High Court in Podgorica. Kwon Found Guilty Of Fraud In Luna Crash Kwon was first arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for possession of falsified travel documents. Since his short arrest, he has been free to travel within the country until a decision is reached on his extradition case. Both the United States and South Korea seek justice from Kwon for the disastrous collapse of the Terra network in May 2022, which saw $40 billion of investor value wiped out across its Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also added Kwon to its long list of crypto firms that have allegedly defrauded investors by issuing unregistered securities. The SEC won the case on Friday, with a Manhatten jury finding Kwon and his company had misled investors about the network, including its alleged adoption as a payments technology.

    "article_summary": "Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, Starknet, is giving insight into why the protocol experienced an estimated four hour outage on April 4. The Block outage marks the latest in a challenging year for the protocol ahead of the April launch of its STRK coin. The post Ethereum Layer-2 Protocol Starknet Sheds Light On What Caused 4-Hour Block Outage appeared first on Cryptonews.",
    "article_detailed_content": "An error within Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Starknet caused a four-hour block outage on April 4, the protocol team revealed in an April 5 statement on X. According to the statement, Starknet discovered a “rounding error bug that led to the reorg of blocks” causing the transaction backlog to hit full capacity. Ethereum Layer-2 Protocol Back Up and Following Block Outage “Consequently, there were a few minutes during which new transactions could not be accepted for processing and were therefore rejected,” the statement continued, revealing that “some transactions were reverted due to changing parameters (e.g. timestamps).” gm! Earlier today, we identified a rounding error bug that led to a reorg of blocks. Starknet’s block production continued as usual. However, the reorg caused the transaction backlog to reach full capacity. Consequently, there were a few minutes during which new transactions… — Starknet (@Starknet) April 5, 2024 “The backlog was cleared and normal network operation resumed,” the protocol added. “We are in touch with relevant parties to ensure there are no further issues.” Starknet’s Series Of Challenges Data from CoinGecko shows that the outage caused the price of Starknet to drop to $1.82 by Thursday morning, though by the time of publication that had increased to $1.91. Thursday’s four-hour outage marks the latest challenge for the Israel-based protocol, having experienced delays in early March following the adoption of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade designed to reduce Layer-2 rollup fees. In January, Starknet’s parent company, StarkWare Industries co-founder and CEO Uri Kolodny stepped down from his role, prompting the company’s president, Eli Ben-Sasson, to take over his role. “Vicious medical challenges at home require my undivided attention,” Kolodny said in a statement at the time. “I took a LoA a year ago, but unfortunately that wasn’t nearly enough.” Writing this is hard for me. I am stepping down as @StarkWareLtd’s CEO. Vicious medical challenges at home require my undivided attention. I took a LoA a year ago, but unfortunately that wasn't nearly enough. I will stay on as a board member of both StarkWare and the @starknet… — Uri Kolodny (@ukolodny) January 11, 2024 Kolodny said he was confident that Ben-Sasson would “lead StarkWare forward with talent and devotion, to great heights.” Massive Scalability, Lower Costs Despite slight controversy, Starknet is set to formally unlock its cryptocurrency, $STRK, in April following a major 728 million airdrop in February, which saw over 220 million claimed within mere hours of its launch. According to CoinGecko, the protocol has a market cap of nearly $1.38 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $18.9 billion, putting it on par with several heavy-hitters across layer-2. Founded in 2018, StarkWare Industries develops zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs to address scalability. According to Starknet’s site, the Ethereum layer-2 protocol seeks to pair low costs with fast transactions and massive scaling. Those eligible for the first round of STRK allocation from February have until June 20 to claim their tokens, while a full analysis regarding Thursday’s outage incident will be unveiled by Starknet at a to-be-determined date.

The post Shiba Inu Price Prediction as SHIB Overtakes Bitcoin Cash – $1 SHIB Possible? appeared first on Cryptonews.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Long-term Shiba Inu (SHIB) price predictions have become increasingly bullish from its insane late-February to early-March pump, which saw it more than 4x within days and reach a market cap above that of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Last at $0.0000269, SHIB has a market cap in the region of $16 billion. Bitcoin Cash’s market cap, meanwhile, was last just above $13 billion. While it has pulled back 40% from March’s highs at $0.000045, SHIB is still 2.5x up on the year. The catalyst was a sudden surge in meme coin risk appetite as Bitcoin hit fresh all-time highs a month ago. Bitcoin (BTC) nearly hit $74,000 in March following January’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Needless to say, this launch has gone on to be the most successful ETF launch of all time. While Bitcoin may be back at record highs, the Shiba Inu price still has a long way to go. It nearly hit $0.00009 in 2021 and is still down 70% compared to these levels. So, SHIB could still be on course for 3x gains from here in this bull market—or more, depending on whether meme coin mania can surpass its insane peak from 2021. Either way, long-term Shiba Inu price bets are set to remain bullish. $1 SHIB Possible? $1 SHIB is possible, but only if the team decides to erase some zeros from the total supply. At the current price of $0.000027, SHIB would need to be nearly 40,000x to get to $1. That would involve its market cap reaching an impossible $640 trillion, which is probably more than the value of all assets on the planet summed. Shiba Inu Price Prediction – Where Next for SHIB? A quick look at the SHIB chart suggests the Shiba Inu price is probably headed for a retest of mid-March lows in the $0.000024 area. That is a strong support zone, with the 50DMA also coming into play. Source: TradingView If the Shiba Inu price can find strong support here, it could soon break its recent downtrend. That could open the door to a quick retest of its recent highs in the $0.000045s. Shiba Inu Alternative to Consider Shiba Inu’s already massive market cap means its potential to deliver big gains to investors is limited. That’s not the case with the new meme coin Dogecoin20. Dogecoin20 is a rework of the meme coin Dogecoin beloved by Elon Musk that just launched in presale. It features the familiar Dogecoin brand but is based on Ethereum, and offers a staking option. That means crypto coin presale investors can generate an impressive passive income, around 65%, per the project’s dashboard. It shouldn’t be surprising that the meme coin has already raised over $10 million. Interested investors should move quickly to secure their tokens before the presale ends on doge day in 17 days. At a current price of $0.00022, investors can buy into the token at a possibly discounted valuation of under $30 million. For a meme coin that could easily be 10x to above $300 million or 100x to above $3 billion, investors are rushing to get involved. Visit Dogecoin20 Here Cryptonews analyst Ari ranks Dogecoin20 as one of his top cryptos to buy right now.

As reported by BNN Bloomberg, Alternate Chief Executive Devon Sin said the virtual lending firm would provide fiat reserve accounts to such firms once they’re officially approved access to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)’s regulatory sandbox. The company is already speaking to over five corporate clients who are considering a stablecoin offering. ZA Banks Welcomes Stablecoin Issuers “Stablecoin use cases are very diverse, be it in wholesale or retail markets, tokenization, settlement for exchange trading, or to tackle overseas remittance pain points,” Sin said. “We are keen to explore how to put them into real-world use with the potential issuers.” Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed one-to-one with fiat currencies or other relatively “stable” assets, such as the US dollar. They provide many of the same benefits as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) including global access and convenient cross-border transfers, but without the volatility that steers many away from such assets. Reliable stablecoins require 100% backed reserves to keep the assets pegged, usually consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term US treasuries. As such, regulation of stablecoins has become a top priority among monetary authorities worldwide, ranging from reserve requirements to money laundering controls. “With these new services, we’re directly addressing the unique challenges faced by stablecoin issuers, ultimately promoting growth and stability within the web3 economy,” Sin told CoinTelegraph. ZA Bank has actively pushed for more web3 involvement, processing over $1 billion in transfer volume from web3 clients in 2023. Before that, it participated with approximately 100 local crypto firms as part of Hong Kong’s regulatory sandbox. Hong Kong Crypto Adoption Unlike its neighbors in China, Hong Kong is pushing to restore its appeal as a crypto hub by welcoming digital assets and establishing clear regulations for the industry. In December, the HKMA issued a consultation paper regarding its proposed stablecoin legislation framework, which would include a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers. One of its proposed requirements is for all circulating stablecoins to be backed by reserves “at least equal to the par value.” Earlier last year, Hong Kong introduced a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms, and more recently showed openness to permitting Bitcoin spot ETFs to launch within the region.

    "article_detailed_content": "News that Ripple Labs is set to launch its US dollar-pegged stablecoin has failed to give the XRP (XRP) price a lasting lift. XRP, the token of the XRP Ledger launched by Ripple Labs in 2012, was last at $0.587. That leaves it close to -7% for the week, and over -20% since 2024 highs printed in March. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the firm’s shift into the $150 billion USD stablecoin market didn’t mean it is giving up on its ambitions to grow its XRP-powered on-demand liquidity product. Rather, Garlinghouse noted that a Ripple stablecoin would act as a complementary product. Either way, XRP investors don’t seem too fussed by the news. The dominant theme for XRP is still the SEC’s battle to classify it as a security issued by Ripple. After some legal wins for Ripple in 2023 that momentarily boosted XRP, momentum has stagnated this year. But long-term price predictions are looking bullish. XRP Price Prediction – Can XRP Reach $100? A long-term assessment of the XRP price suggests it has formed a pennant structure in the last four years. A long-term assessment of the XRP price suggests it has formed a pennant structure in the last four years. / Source: TradingView A downside breakout could trigger a drop back toward 2022 lows under $0.30. However, the upside price chance seems greater in a bullish market environment. A break to the north of the pennant structure could see the XRP price quickly retest its 2021 highs around $2. That could mean 4x gains for XRP. While not impossible, reaching a $100 token price during the current bull market seems far-fetched. That would require a 170x rally, taking XRP’s market cap to above $5.5 trillion—more than four times Bitcoin’s current market cap. And XRP isn’t even close to the current levels of adoption of Bitcoin or as strong of an adoption outlook as BTC. XRP Alternative to Consider – 5thScape Investors looking at altcoins might want to consider an alternative high-risk-reward investment strategy. Presale investing. Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market looking for potential gems. One potential market leader they like the look of is a first-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR/AR project, 5thScape, which has now raised nearly $4 million in its presale. 5thScape is pitching itself as the world’s first VR/AR mixed-reality platform to break boundaries by integrating crypto tokenization to provide a superior reward experience. The project runs on the Ethereum network and will use the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities. Virtual and augmented reality also need great hardware to work well. So, the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair to maximize comfort and ergonomics and deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls. The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build the decentralized network infrastructure. Our presale has surged past stage 3! Join us now and delve into a world of virtual reality with our multi-utility token. Don't miss out on being part of our vibrant community! #cryptocrash #cryptocrash #Wormhole #cryptocurrency #5thScape #Presale #4thstage pic.twitter.com/QeznEVAvFJ — 5th Scape (@5th_scape) April 4, 2024 Priced at $0.00285, a steep discount versus the token’s planned launch price of $0.01, investors who get involved now can lock in paper gains of 250%. Given its token supply of 5.1 billion, investors who get in now are essentially buying into the project at a market cap of $52.1 million. 5thScape could easily become a major market leader in its VR/AR niche, however. There is a good chance that it could one day become a $500 million market cap token. That means investors who get in now could potentially lock in gains in the region of 1,000%. 5thScape was audited by Coinsult, and no major issues were found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC’d by SolidProof; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024.

    "article_summary": "On April 4, Binance declared that as of April 18, 2024, it will no longer be accepting deposits or transactions of Bitcoin Ordinals. The exchange then gave investors of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on Bitcoin the advice to remove their holdings from the NFT marketplace trading platform by May 18, 2024. The post Binance Suspends Bitcoin Ordinals Trading – What’s Going On? appeared first on Cryptonews.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Binance announced on April 4 that it will suspend Bitcoin Ordinals trades and deposits from April 18, 2024. The exchange has then advised the holders of the Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to withdraw their assets from the trading platform NFT marketplace before May 18, 2024. Binance did not disclose the reason behind the suspension of Bitcoin Ordinals but added that it sought to “streamline product offerings” on its marketplace. Additionally, the Binance NFT marketplace will no longer offer airdrops, utilities, and benefits related to Bitcoin NFTs after April 10, 2024, according to the announcement. Binance Ordinals Suspension Stems from Waning Demand Despite this setback from Binance, OKX plans to support four new inscription standards, as it believes Bitcoin Ordinals will play a pivotal role in 2024. Bitcoin Ordinals, otherwise known as Bitcoin NFTs, allows users to embed digital content such as music, audio, text, video, images, or art onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Binance added support for the collectibles in 2023, promising further opportunities to collectors. The inclusion appears to be over in less than a year, however, leaving community members surprised about the turn of events. The decision to end support for Bitcoin Ordinals comes at a time when interests and trading activities in the overall NFTs market, including Bitcoin-based NFTs, are at multi-year lows, according to data from non-fungible.com. Non-fungible.com data shows a downtrend of trading activities in the NFT market. Statista data reveals a stark decline in NFT sales, which peaked at 117,000 in August 2021 but has plummeted to 2,400 across several blockchains, including Ethereum. Bitcoin Network Faces Challenges from Bitcoin Ordinals While Bitcoin Ordinals have been adversely affected by the drop in the global NFT market, many investors have raised concerns about its effect on the security of the Bitcoin network and the congestion it creates. Luke Dashjr, a popular Bitcoin Core developer, disclosed on December 6, 2023, that Bitcoin NFTs had caused widespread network clogs, increased fees, and “exposed a vulnerability” in the network. PSA: “Inscriptions” are exploiting a vulnerability in #Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain. Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code,… — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) December 6, 2023 Since its inception, there has been a high volume of inscriptions, which has led to Bitcoin network congestion and high transaction fees, with users complaining of slow transaction processing. Dune Analytics data revealed that the Bitcoin network has recorded over 64.17 million inscriptions and has generated over $430.7 million in transaction fees. Dune Analytics data show that the Bitcoin network has 64.17M inscriptions to date. Meanwhile, the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals has fueled a debate over whether or not inscriptions representing NFTs and BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network should exist. Recall that some Bitcoin developers collaborated to standardize BRC-20 tokens. Some experts believe that the network and its token, BTC, were meant for pure peer-to-peer (P2P) financial transactions and may suffer from the same problems that have plagued the Ethereum chain for years, including scammy meme coins, NFT pictures of monkeys hogging the space, and ever-rising transaction fees. Others argue that Bitcoin Ordinals have driven positive momentum and innovation within the network as a pathway toward decentralization, however.

    "article_detailed_content": "Major crypto prices chop within weekly ranges as traders contend with stronger US economic data and fresh hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers. These factors have combined to push markets to downsize bets on Fed rate cuts in 2024. Investors looking for fast returns continue to comb the altcoin markets for the best crypto to buy today. Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the upper $67,000s, close to its 21DMA. Its price dropped more than $2,000 on Friday after a stronger-than-expected US labor market report. Fed policymakers have also been downplaying the need for rate cuts this week. Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan said on Friday that it’s much too soon to think about rate cuts, and Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated this stance. As traders back peddle on rate-cut bets, this complicates the outlook for BTC. Expectations for Fed easing have been a major tailwind for BTC in recent months. That suggests Bitcoin may not be the best crypto to buy today, given the possibility of continued consolidation. Of course, strong spot Bitcoin ETF demand and the upcoming halving mean long-term price risks are tilted to the upside. >$200mil net inflows for the Bitcoin ETFs yesterday Looks like the GBTC whales have stopped selling (supposedly Genesis dumped over $2.1billion of GBTC). The overhang has finally gone? WSFB if so pic.twitter.com/TG94sKqx8S — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) April 5, 2024 Gold’s push to fresh record highs on geopolitical risk may also be a tailwind. As Coinbase noted on Friday, investors are increasingly viewing gold as Bitcoin. But altcoins still potentially offer a better chance of near-term gains. That’s because altcoins can pump regardless of broader market conditions but on their own bullish narratives. Here are some strong performers on Friday that could be the best crypto to buy today. Best Crypto to Buy Today NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Ethereum rival NEAR Protocol’s native token NEAR is up close to 6% in the past 24 hours on Friday. Last just above $7.35, the cryptocurrency is eyeing a quick 3x rally back to a record high near $22. With a market cap of just under $8 billion, NEAR could easily 3-5x from here. That’s why it also ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Toncoin (TON) Telegram-affiliated cryptocurrency Toncoin (TON) is consolidating close to record highs on Friday. According to CoinMarketCap, TON was last up around 5% in 24 hours, and its market cap is just under $19 billion. Its affiliation with the world-leading private messaging application Telegram positions Toncoin as a potential leader in the 2024 bull market. Its market cap could go much higher from here, with investors potentially set for 3-5x gains. That’s why it could be the best crypto to buy today. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Bitcoin alternative Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the best performers on Friday, as per CoinMarketCap. Up 3.3% in 24 hours, BCH is consolidating close to multi-year highs in the $670 area. In the wake of its recent halving, bets have risen so that it could pump back to its 2021 peaks around $1,600. The prospect of more than 2x gains means it could be the best crypto to buy today. But BCH will have to snap its long-term, multi-year downtrend first. It is currently finding strong resistance in this area. Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains. But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in crypto presales. This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development. These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors. Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform. If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good. The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out. Here is a list of 14 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2024.

The post Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Blasts SEC Over Crypto Regulation, XRP Lawsuit: “Get Off Your Soap Box” appeared first on Cryptonews.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The ongoing conflict between Ripple Labs and the SEC centered on the XRP lawsuit intensified on Wednesday, with Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty accusing the SEC of failing to provide clear guidelines for crypto regulation. The statement was made in response to SEC Director of Enforcement Gurbir Grewal’s Tuesday speech, which cited the year-long XRP lawsuit. SEC Needs To Own Up To War On Crypto, Ripple Lawyer Says Following remarks at the Practicing Law Institute condemning the crypto sector’s non-compliance with regulators, Alderoty alleged that Grewal’s statements failed to paint a clear picture of the regulatory atmosphere. In a string of X posts, Alderoty claimed that the SEC has failed to provide “clear crypto guidance” while adding and subtracting “factors from the Howey test at whim.” Dir. Grewal says the crypto enforcement unit acts with integrity, but ignores the DebtBox sanctions for “gross abuse of power,” the Ripple Judge’s admonishment for lack of “faithful allegiance to the law,” and the “arbitrary and capricious” finding in the Grayscale case. https://t.co/rZnaumdBOd — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) April 3, 2024 Established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1946, The Howey test is a legal framework designed to adjudicate what offering constitutes an investment contract (a.k.a. security) and has been at the heart of critical regulatory debate regarding the crypto sector. On Tuesday, Grewal seemingly lauded the SEC’s application of the Howey test, stating that “the SEC has clearly and consistently applied Howey and its progeny to protect investors in the crypto space.” “If this Agency wants to honestly repair the institutional damage inflicted (both to itself and the industry) over the last many years in this misguided war on crypto, it needs to get off its soapbox and own up to these truths,” Alderoty countered. SEC And Ripple Face-Off On Crypto Regulation After XRP Lawsuit Alderoty took aim at Grewal’s comments in an additional X post, particularly regarding the SEC’s years-long litigation against Ripple over its cryptocurrency token, XRP. “On the substance, he cites one portion of the Ripple ruling but ignores that the SEC lost or gave up on most of its claims in the case, including the Court’s rejection of the SEC’s assertion that XRP was in and of itself a security,” Alderoty noted. The SEC originally filed the controversial lawsuit against Ripple in late 2020, alleging that the crypto exchange broke the law by offering unregistered securities. Ripple won a partial victory in the case last year, with U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruling that the SEC’s unregistered securities claim was incorrect. Torres found the crypto exchange guilty of breaking security laws by offering XRP to several institutional buyers, however. Grewal cited the XRP lawsuit in his speech, claiming that “court after court has confirmed” that “federal securities laws apply equally to everyone.” “You don’t get your own rules,” he added. Ripple and the SEC are due to face off in a trial later this month regarding the classification of XRP as a security.

GBTC began trading at $1.10 but climbed 63% to reach a high of $1.79 immediately after the launch as a result of the whale purchase.

It will be followed by a centralized exchange (CEX) listing announcement next week. Details on the CEX listing are thin at present, but the token will begin trading on the CEX the day after the announcement, April 11. A major update to the gamification protocol will follow on April 18, 2024. From ICO To Uniswap: GBTC There’s nothing out there quite like Green Bitcoin. Early investors agree, and have poured a tidy $9.6 million into the eco-friendly Bitcoin alternative over a month-long ICO that has just ended. If the popularity of gamified green staking seems surprising, it’s probably because the idea is much simpler than it sounds. To claim daily $GBTC rewards, users have to buy $GBTC tokens, stake them on the protocol, and play the price prediction game. They then cast daily predictions on whether Bitcoin will go up or down within 24 hours. Every 24 hours, the users that predicted correctly earn a share of rewards from the daily staking reward pool proportional to the amount of $GBTC tokens they staked. Holders can stake tokens for up to six months to earn bigger rewards. Staking is also a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC’s circulating supply, staking acts as a long-term price driver. Big burn news coming later today! We'd highly advise turning your notifications on. pic.twitter.com/GwAO0O8pJP — GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) April 5, 2024 GBTC is Better For The Planet Than Bitcoin The $GBTC token has a circulating supply of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin. Having a cap on the number of tokens in circulation creates value by ensuring scarcity. However, Green Bitcoin is much greener than the world’s largest cryptocurrency. That’s because $GBTC is on Ethereum, which uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, making the token cleaner and more efficient than its inspiration It consumes just 34 watt-hours (Wh) per transaction compared to Bitcoin’s 1,173,000 Wh. Green Bitcoin ($GBTC) and The BTC Halving 2024 will surely go down as Bitcoin’s most significant year since its launch in January 2009. Fans and enthusiasts may argue that the 2021 bull run is what got us to where we are today, but adoption has increased significantly since then, despite the 2022 recession, which leveled the industry with bankruptcies and scandals. Today there are eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs that are currently the talk of Wall Street. Bitcoin set a new all-time high of nearly $74k posted three weeks ago; it also looks set to climb to new highs after the halving, perfect for anyone wanting to get into Green Bitcoin’s gamified green staking. The Liquidity Pool has now been locked! Safe trading! Proof: https://t.co/SYbpjt59Ya pic.twitter.com/AiikakkLY7 — GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) April 5, 2024 Bitcoin’s fourth quadrennial halving arrives on April 19 this year. The halving is an event in Bitcoin’s code that slashes miners’ rewards in half. Since miners control the issuance of new Bitcoin, this cuts the new supply in half. The law of supply and demand dictates that when there is a supply squeeze at times of high demand, commodities become more valuable. Bitcoin halvings have historically preceded bull runs. Analysts believe this year will be no different, thanks to demand created by Wall Street’s interest in Bitcoin ETFs coupled with the upcoming supply squeeze. And since bull runs are inherently volatile, that means there will be plenty of rallies and crashes in the near future. Nobody can say with certainty what the year will add to Bitcoin, but it’s the perfect kind of year to make some predictions and win some money.

    "article_detailed_content": "Solana meme coin markets are on fire again, and in the latest DEX launched pump, recent legend Jeo Boden crypto token has exploded to a new all-time high. This article will provide an analysis of BODEN’s current price trends and look to see whether an upcoming meme coin CEX listing for DOGE20, represents a more promising investment opportunity at this time. *press refresh button* *price is up* The tech is good pic.twitter.com/cf18OSvs1L — Mail On Sunday (@YouHaveMael_) April 4, 2024 The Jeo Boden crypto project has reached a new all-time high, thanks to relentless community-building efforts and ongoing social media campaigns. These strategies have not only maintained a dedicated base of savvy holders but also attracted new investors eager for substantial returns before the US Presidential Election. BODEN Price Analysis: As Jeo Boden Token Accelerates To New All-Time High – Is Presidential Solana Meme Coin Back? As price action reels from the new all-time high, Jeo Boden is currently trading at a market price of $0.80 (representing a 24-hour change of +22.27%). This comes after BODEN price slammed out of a strong ranging pattern between $0.23 and $0.50 at around midnight on March 4. The sudden breakout triggered a rapid upside climb to hit a new all-time high at upper trendline resistance around $0.88. Now in retreat, as holders take stock of the recovery move, BODEN is left standing at a jaw-dropping $545m market cap – which just goes to show the scale of growth for Solana meme coins in 2024. Yet, with such a high market cap in play, returns for late entrants become limited at these levels, with upside potential limited to a 2-3x move. This reduces appetite for investors, especially when it’s compared to the shockingly small $4.33m unlocked liquidity pool underpinning the half-billion dollar valuation. For this reason, smart money is shifting their attention to a newer meme coin, that has recently surpassed $10m in funding at presale ahead of major CEX listings. Here’s Why Dogecoin20 Will Outperform BODEN Token in April 2024 – Don’t Miss Upcoming CEX Listings March played host to major crypto presale fever across the community, and one of the most promising stars of the season emerged in DOGECOIN20, which went viral in presale phase to hammer $10m in funding. Now, with a committed and fully-funded development team in place, and a rapidly growing community, this new meme coin is poised to trigger major upsets in the meme coin rankings later this month. Does $DOGE20 also give you the feeling of power? #Dogecoin20 #DOGE #Altcoin #Crypto #Web3 #Memecoin pic.twitter.com/p9Zd8GwxIy — Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) April 5, 2024 This is because DOGE20 offers a double-barrelled moon-shot, on one hand teasing successor status to the legendary meme coin DOGE, and on the other, offering a superb Bitcoin halving better play – with CEX launches planned for DOGE Day (just 24-hours after the Bitcoin Halving event). Indeed, the CEX launches are expected to propel DOGECOIN20 to dramatic heights, with retail investors anticipating as much as 100x returns amid the viral market appetite for high-quality meme coin projects. Chuck in the opportunity for high APY staking, and you’ve got a holders dream – a meme coin with proven potential in presale – heading imminently for CEX markets with billions in volume.

The last time BCH traded above $700 was on September 5, 2021, when the price was $711.56, according to data by CoinGecko. Source: TradingView Still, in the grand scheme of things, BCH’s current price of $672 is some 82% down from its all-time high of $3,785.82, set on December 20, 2017, following a Coinbase listing announcement. Given the distance of 7 years and more than $3,000, Bitcoin Cash probably won’t set new all-time highs this year, even if Bitcoin does. Bitcoin Cash has a Long History Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin back in 2017 after Bitcoiners formed two distinct factions around a software upgrade known as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91. The faction that became Bitcoin Cash were in favor of larger block sizes. Larger block sizes allow the network to process more transactions per second, however, miners have to use greater hardware to mine blocks. This ups the mining entry level, making it only really viable for universities, private companies and other organizations to run nodes. Bitcoin Cash came from the faction who see Bitcoin primarily as a means of paying for goods and services, unlike the prevailing philosophy among original Bitcoin maxis who see Bitcoin as a store of value. Over on the trading chart, BCH grew steadily throughout February. March’s gains were steeper, but the candles chart a more volatile course through the graph to the present day, where Bitcoin Cash is trading 4.4% higher than it was 24 hours ago as it outpaces market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum. BCH is currently trading above its 30-day moving average with a stable Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 52. BCH Hits New Highs As VR Token 5SCAPE Collects $3.9 Million Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been around for years, so people know it and trust it. For many, it’s as solid as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana or XRP despite being an outlier from the top ten biggest by market cap. However, crypto is a lot more than just a means of payment or a store of value. It’s also ushering in a new generation of web experiences, which supporters are hoping the world will soon know as “Web3” and the metaverse. Those wanting to supplement their BCH holdings with something edgier may want to check out VR gaming token 5SCAPE. It has raised $3.9 million over four rounds of an ongoing ICO, putting it well over a quarter of the way towards its presale target $15 million. The token currently changes hands at $0.00285, but this will rise 15% to $0.00327 when the fifth round begins after $5 million. At the end of the presale, 5SCAPE will have a fixed listing price of $0.01, giving the token a potential prelaunch upside of over 250% to investors that buy in right now, before the listing.

    "article_detailed_content": "Venture capital (VC) funding in the crypto space has experienced a surge in the first quarter of 2024, breaking a two-year downtrend. Both the total amount invested and the number of projects receiving VC funding have seen substantial increases since Q4 2023, according to data gathered by crypto analysis platform Crypto Koryo. The data shows a notable 38% rise in funds invested during the quarter, indicating a renewed investor confidence in the crypto industry. Moreover, there has been a remarkable 49% increase in the number of projects securing funding, a level not witnessed since Q4 2021. More Crypto Investments to Come Crypto Koryo believes that the crypto positive trend could signify the beginning of a new wave of investments. The analysis platform draws parallels between the recent uptick and patterns observed in Q4 2020, which preceded a massive influx of VC investments into the crypto sector. Notably, this quarter witnessed a higher interest from crypto-focused venture firms, in contrast to previous periods where banks and non-crypto VCs dominated investments. Prominent crypto-native VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz Crypto, OKX Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, and Polychain have emerged as dominant players in the funds invested during the quarter. Long-term Trend Both total investments and number of investments have increased compared to last quarter. Compared to last quarter, there was a 38% increase in amount invested and 49% increase in the number of projects invested. pic.twitter.com/QhIcsOB0qw — Crypto Koryo (@CryptoKoryo) April 4, 2024 In March alone, crypto VC funds allocated over $1.1 billion across 180 investments. This reflects a remarkable 52.5% month-on-month increase in VC funding for crypto projects, with a particular focus on infrastructure and decentralized finance. The upswing in funding during Q1 2024 follows the positive momentum witnessed in Q4 2023. Compared to Q3 2023, Q4 2023 experienced a 2.5% increase in crypto VC investments, marking the first rise in VC investments for crypto projects since March 2022. The crypto industry faced a challenging year in 2022, with a decline in venture capital funding coinciding with lackluster market conditions. Throughout the year, venture capital investments in the sector experienced consecutive quarterly drops. Crypto Funds See a Surge in Assets Earlier this year, Balance, a digital asset custodian based in Canada, has revealed that it has once again achieved $2 billion in assets under custody (AUC) amid the recent recovery in crypto markets. Likewise, Korea Digital Asset (KODA), the largest institutional crypto custody service in South Korea, has seen a remarkable growth in crypto assets under its custody. Just recently, the company revealed that the value of these crypto assets under its custody expanded by nearly 248% in the second half of 2023. KODA, which was established through a collaboration between major Korean bank KB Bank, crypto venture capital firm Hashed, and blockchain tech firm Haechi Labs, said that the value of these assets reached approximately 8 trillion Korean won ($6 billion) by the end of last year. This was a substantial increase from the 2.3 trillion won recorded at the end of June 2023. According to analysts at Bernstein Research, crypto funds could reach a staggering $500 billion to $650 billion within the next five years, a significant leap from the current valuation of approximately $50 billion.

    "article_detailed_content": "Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab recently sat down for a chat with Matt Duea, co-founder of the popular betting brand Roobet. Duea talked about the natural connection blockchain and crypto have with the gaming and betting worlds, and how he came to co-found Roobet. He explained the difference between Web2 and Web3 gambling, touched upon the partnerships with Snoop Dogg and UFC, and told us why influencer gambling streams are so entertaining. In this interview, Duea discussed: difference between Web3 and Web2 gambling; advancing everyday application of cryptocurrencies; official social casino of the UFC, roobet.fun; future of crypto gambling regulations: how regulations might evolve and impact the industry; blockchain and crypto integration: blockchain’s role in Roobet’s operations and supported cryptocurrencies. You can read what the two Matts talked about below or watch their discussion above. Ethereum Predictions (Don’t) Come True Before Roobet became one of the behemoths in the space, Matt Duea was working a job that would prove indispensable to the creation of this betting brand. He worked on a marketing team, a position that allowed him to meet and collaborate with various people. “And when they had a new project kind of rolling up, that is how I got on board,” he said. The position allowed him to educate himself about blockchain “full time,” and about its convergence with video games. Speaking of which, Duea himslef was a gamer, so the concept of digital currencies was very familiar to him. So in 2017, Duea became increasingly interested in blockchain, crypto, tokenization, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and he started “poking around that whole crazy world of people exchanging and trading these virtual items.” From then on, he went “full steam” ahead, exploring this industry and its community. Ultimately, the marketing company he worked for joined with a blockchain company. “And we were doing all kinds of cool stuff as a marketing team, introducing these concepts to the world. And I was just enamored by it,” Duea said. Interestingly, in 2018, “nobody cared,” he said. Even their company was convinced that NFTs on Ethereum would never work because it’s too expensive and too slow. They were both right and wrong. Ethereum did end up being very expensive. “But I guess the thing that was wrong was people were willing to pay the gas,” said Duea. Not Your Typical Casino Asked to describe Roobet, Matt Duea said that it was founded by an online community with its online community in mind. Before he joined the project, it housed a few house games and “a small, quiet, sleepy community.” But the team worked hard to make it an active space for all involved. They often say that Roobet’s more than a casino – it’s a club. It may not be the biggest, said Duea, but Roobet aims to be the best and the most fun. And crypto made sense as part of this business. One of its benefits is that it provides a provably fair mechanism that helps everybody feel confident that outcomes can’t be manipulated. Furthermore, per Duea, “We don’t look like your typical casino because we didn’t come from that space. We came from the gaming space.” The team merged the ideas of crypto, blockchain, entertainment, and betting when they were locked inside during the COVID-19 pandemic. At that point, “I think nerds really stood out because we were the ones that knew how to play around and have a good time and engage with people socially online.” At the same time, everybody else was “really paying attention to their digital selves.” “It was like betting had a golden moment,” Duea said. Roobet 2.0 Is Now Live! Welcome to the faster, sleeker, and slightly purple-r Roobet pic.twitter.com/HdNGVuzi0c — Roobet (@Roobet) April 1, 2024 Notably, their game Crash became a massive success. The world loved it, Duea remarked, and it became a huge part of how people got to know Roobet. “Many people associate Roobet with ‘the rocket game’.” There is still a house version of Crash to this day. The team continued adding house games, as well as “the biggest global providers.” Moreover, Roobet provides a unique rewards system, trying to “stay true to our gamer, crypto-first type of mentality when it comes to product.” The platform also accepts fiat in order to include as many users as possible. Web3 Gambling vs Web2 Gambling The major difference between a Web2 and a Web3 gambling platform is that the latter offers crypto support. Roobet has “a fascination and a love” for all things crypto, blockchain, gaming, and internet culture. Odds are that many other operators will not share the sentiment. Also, from a licensing standpoint, most can’t “really touch” crypto. Very few licenses today are willing to support a brand trying to innovate using this type of technology. However, this is likely to change over the next few years as adoption increases, Duea opined. Moreover, crypto is often being villainized and met with resistance to acknowledge its legitimacy. It is not easy to set up all the licensing, and there needs to be constant communication with different regulatory bodies and constant monitoring of all business aspects and potential risks. Furthermore, Duea remarked that it is difficult for Web2 brands – especially large ones – to adopt a new payment type overnight. Even for Roobet, there were bumps on the road. For example, when they integrated Dogecoin (DOGE), there were commenters who laughed at the decision, asking whom it was for. “Well, who it’s for is the Doge community. Who it’s for is the crypto community,” Duea said. And while everybody can speculate about Doge’s intrinsic value, “once you’re done arguing over that, if you want to gamble it, come on over to Roobet.” That said, Duea hopes that more platforms will adopt crypto as it becomes better understood and more popular. This is relevant, he argues, because crypto would become substantially more accessible – not everybody has access to platforms like Roobet, but they do to many other platforms globally. This isn't an April Fools Joke, our $1,000,000 Raffle is LIVE https://t.co/7XsRShL1Qo — Roobet (@Roobet) April 1, 2024 It is also important to Duea himself. He wants to see crypto technology more celebrated and less demonized. He also wants to see people make money, he added. Besides, when people start using crypto for betting, they certainly pay more attention to it, because now they’ve got “skin in the game.” Streaming Dopamine Online betting is not going anywhere. One of the noticeable examples is the emergence of massive streamers gambling millions in front of a captivated audience glued to their screens. It’s gotten popular during the lockdowns, and it’s still going strong. Duea opined that gambling content has become a form of entertainment. “Casino content is very entertaining to watch and similar to watching maybe your favorite steamer playing a video game on that last level trying not to die.” It’s a form of a parasocial relationship, he added, providing a dopamine hit. And it is unlikely to go away. Gambling and sports betting are actually becoming more familiar to many people. Also, content creators can monetize it better than advertising or merchandise. Locking Up Big Partnerships Partnerships are “cool opportunities” for Roobet to be a part of “these very long-standing legacies” and the innovation they’re pushing for, Matt Duea remarked. In April 2023, Roobet announced a $420,000 giveaway in partnership with their “Chief Ganjaroo Officer, Snoop Dogg.” Snoop Dogg has a “classic approach” to business, Duea said, “old school” in many ways. He conducts business very straightforwardly. And the collaboration with him is deeper than just a betting sponsorship. “I think when it comes to crypto, entertainment, supporting creators, […] when it comes to helping people own their work and build platforms under themselves that allow artists and creators to feed themselves, long term, and build businesses – those are the things that we realized very early Snoop connects with.” In July 2023, Roobet.fun became the official social casino of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in a multi-year deal. The platform finds the combination of the sport’s brutality and its origin stories interesting to be a part of. The fighters are like real-life action figures, Duea said. There are both betting and gaming elements there, he suggested. Fighters “go in, and they just don’t know what’s going to happen. […] And it really gets your adrenaline going just being around it.” Making partnerships continues. Endorsements from big names, of course, help, said Duea, but it’s not enough to bring in customers. “It is more of a trust-building thing,” he added. In the end, you must let the product speak for itself. __________ About Matt Duea Matt Duea is an entrepreneur and a co-founder of Roobet, a betting brand for the next generation of gamers, and part of the group behind Roobet.fun and Roobet.com.

    "article_detailed_content": "The legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Binance (and its American arm), and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, is about to enter a critical region. Both sides on the defensive are closing in on the discovery and depositions stage. This joint report that they submitted to the court today indicates that they see none of the disputes that a judge should deal with. This clears the way to overcoming the problems that were imposed by a court’s order. Therefore, this order directed Binance to provide specific documents, and for Binance.US, it was necessary to establish independent systems, wallets, and personnel. Binance.US has again been supplying the SEC with new information, which it claims is its last to be handed over. Coordinating exchange’s testimonies is a big step forward. The SEC is ready to review the submissions and identify any remaining vulnerabilities. The SEC and Zhao continue their discussions, during which they look to finalize all the remaining document requests to reach a final settlement rather than bring the court back in. SEC eyes fines in Binance legal battle The court order triggered the late stage of the lawsuit, which ended with Binance labeling its venture capital offshoot, Binance Labs, differently. A crucial deposition, known as Rule 30(b)(6), is soon to happen in the next month or so. Through this phase, we identify essential witnesses and documents, the feasibility of rule violation, and the likely consequences. The SEC’s winning track, the Coinbase case, and Peter D. Failla’s rulings may influence the course of the Binance case. Compared to previous accusations that Coinbase faced, Binance may see the SEC imposing summary judgments about paying substantial fines in a possible agreement. Both parties are following a preparatory program in anticipation of the deposition that will help them clarify and resolve matters amicably. Upcoming deposition to uncover legal issues The joint report from the Commission and the Exchange indicates that the battle has reached a critical phase. The fact that they settled for now and that no current problems require a judge’s decision presents them as ready to go further. Therefore, that shows the discovery and deposition process might not have obstacles. The consent deal has already had a major impact on Bitgraph. As the case progresses, the incoming Rule 30(b)(6) deposition will reveal some possible legal infringements and fines. In the meantime, the SEC and Binance parties remain in dialogue on the unresolved issues to resolve them peacefully.",

More than 33,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since October 7, and six unidentified Israeli intelligence sources who talked with +972 claimed that Israeli military commanders utilized the list of targets to approve airstrikes that resulted in exceptionally high civilian casualties. The ravages of warfare and AI military systems Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven military systems, such as Israel’s Lavender software, have led to more devastation in conflict places like Gaza. Renowned for its uncanny capacity to detect Hamas personal, lavender has turned into a double-edged weapon that slashes through civilian communities and shatters lives in its path. The stated accuracy rate of 90% conceals the terrible reality of how this technology, when used carelessly, can kill innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. A source told 972mag, that, “We are asked to look for high-rise buildings with half a floor that can be attributed to Hamas,” Source: +972mag As is well known, artificial intelligence operates on a variety of factors, and the accuracy of these parameters is dependent upon their fine tuning. Change the data parameters, and the computer begins to present us with a variety of police and civil defense officials, against whom it would be inappropriate to use bombs said another source. Another dubious criterion was whether or not cell phones were changed on a regular basis; most Gazans dealt with the social chaos of war on a daily basis. Any individual who assists Hamas without receiving payment or who was a previous member was likewise marked as suspicious by the algorithm. As 971mag source said, “Each of these features is inaccurate” Source: +972mag The ethical puzzle of automation on the battlefield Deeply ethical problems about AI-driven warfare are becoming more and more pressing when the smoke from battle zones dissipates. Once hailed as a deterrent to unbridled automation, the idea of “humans in the loop” is today seen as a thin line separating algorithmic judgments from their practical implications. An insightful glimpse into the thinking of those tasked with overseeing the complexities of modern warfare is offered by the testimonies of Israeli commanders who are debating the moral consequences of violence made possible by artificial intelligence. Since it became apparent how disastrous AI-driven conflict may be, one worry has been on people’s minds: can humans really afford to give machines the upper hand in matters of life and death? Moral accountability and responsible stewardship are more crucial than ever as nations grapple with the moral consequences of automation and the real danger of AI-enabled violence. The dangers of unbridled technological growth are starkly illustrated by historical lessons in a world on the verge of a horrific new period of warfare.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Andre Cronje, the creator of the Fantom blockchain, made interesting observations on Solana’s operational issues during the peak of this blockchain chain’s popularity. To his Twitter account, known as “X,” Cronje shared an official statement countering the growing narrative regarding Solana’s current problems, which had received immense attention from the crypto world on discussion boards. Claims that the Solana network’s issue originates from its rapid growth and swifter success rather than stemming from a basic flaw in its construct or consensus systems. Andre Cronje on Solana’s Scalability Solutions Amid High Demand Solana was created to become Ethereum’s main alternative to smart contact possibilities with high scalability but fewer complications. Yet, its stellar voyage has mission-depressing technical glitches such as several other communication failures. Such cases are planted by users and cause reliability issues to appear as the platform scales. Jornen mentions that at the heart of Solana’s problems are engineering issues linked to the capacity of the blockchain to hold the massive spate of traffic. This is the reason for the bandwagon effect, as the greater demand for block intermediation causes congestion, thereby slowing down transaction times and deteriorating user experience. Nonetheless, Cronje asserts that consensus mechanisms are not the factor to blame here. Instead, the right technology solutions are bound to cure the problems identified. Seeing a lot of \"I told you so's\" against Solana, because *checks notes* Solana currently has so much demand for blockspace that they need to optimize some bottlenecks (which also btw, is just an engineering hurdle and not a fault of consensus or any critical component). Victim… — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) April 6, 2024 The report on issues of Solana’s project draws analogies in various blockchain technology sectors. Besides, Ethereum itself underwent a crucial change to deal with the identical scalability and efficiency problems that it initially faced, moving from the Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) model through a Merge. The Solana development group, with founding member Anatoly Yakovenko, is very much involved in finding a solution to the network’s congestion crisis. They are directing their efforts towards better infrastructure support that will allow the platform to host all the users and transactions without leading to a performance drop-off. Solana’s pivot: mastering growth and innovation For Solana, going forward, apart from the technology upgrades, a deep strategic review is another yardstick for scaling up efficiently while maintaining security and performance metrics. The problems it ultimately faces are due to the growing pains that are common for many blockchain platforms, which have to learn how to be efficient and scalable in the face of user demand. Solana has the chance to prove it can sustain and innovate, easily adapting to any setbacks. These engineering challenges can be tackled accordingly, leading the platform to eventually gain recognition as among the top smart contract platforms that can comfortably handle any module of application and service. Things will heat up for investors, developers, and users in the following weeks as everyone will be on the lookout, trying to figure out Solana’s future and claim in the DeFi space. Andre Cronje’s opinion scrutinizes and weighs Solana’s complexities and issues in terms of the challenges they bring, not as obstacles that are too difficult to overcome. His philosophies point out that tactical innovation and adaptation of strategic plans constitute essential aspects for the evolution of the blockchain platform.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Whether there is the work of OpenAI, Google, and Meta, AI funding the industrial sector, which comprises various means like collecting or accumulating enormous volumes of digital data in different creative but controversial ways, it is clear that automation abilities and capabilities are increasing. Notably, the efforts entailing actions like taking the measures outlined above (i.e., taking legal limits and corporate policies into consideration) are equivalent to the considerable amount of data used to train the AI systems. OpenAI’s whisper initiative: Mining YouTube conversations Our Whisper story started just last year. There is an overwhelming shortage of first-rate English texts that cause delays in education delivery. Whisper was the next step by Google. It understood YouTube’s ocean of dialogues and was developed as text, a text-to-speech application. The AI-powered tool itself, consisting of more than one million hours of YouTube videos being audited by AI to generate fresh texts ( essentially, a new conversation), has been utilized for training AI models produced from the state-of-the-art down to GPT-4, the latest version of the ChatGPT chatbot. Even though some employees argued that OpenAI’s Microsoft footage would plagiarize YouTube from across the board, the ethics of plagiarism were still debatable; in addition, some workers admitted that it would be impossible to precisely align with YouTube’s intentions. Similarly, the acquirement of objection in algorithmically processing the videos for extracting the textual contents to feed the A.I. models might have been considered a threat to video creators’ copyright, causing outrage. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was also concerned about using copyrighted elements from publishing houses like Simon & Schuster, among others. At the same time, it also discussed the acquisition of the general web content, potentially to get caught in copyright infringement. The data crunch: Driving unconventional approaches Data gathering that is full of competition helps to note the pivotal position of data and identify it in the development of AI tech. Language into an AI commands more and more training datasets, including the Commonwealth, which are manipulated down to Wikipedia and Reddit from outside of these sources today. For tech companies—especially those having difficulty reaching very common data sources like traditional data stores—creating AI-powered models can be an alternative solution that may be desirable enough in such cases. Companies in techindicate data collection to be necessary for AI training while the same process is in question at the court legally. In their defense, OpenAI and Microsoft won an allegation about the illegal employment of copyright material against them. Still, they said their actions fell within the legal principle of fair use. In recent years, the number of applications submitted to the US Copyright Office by copyright holders has exceeded the number of 10,000, which clearly shows that copyright law in the AI era is unique and brand new. Consequently, the main players always confront dangers related to the infringement of many works under the guise that there are no licensed purposes for the models using AI on this basis. The imperative for massive data sets Overall, Kaipan’s work de Jared, scientist the scale, has been unintentionally epic in AI development. Data-driven content is one of AI’s components needed for the training process, but it cannot function well without the models that have been trained well and operate effectively. With the increase in artificial intelligence technology, the demand for data to succeed in the market escalates at a high rate, leaving companies with questions related to law, ethics, and privacy. Therefore, artificial intelligence algorithms must use these data sets to succeed in the market. The data-collection behavior of V.IPs is being disfigured for AI enhancements; the typical methodological oath is being coarsened. Whether through one of their YouTube talks or the creation of synthetic data generative, these companies are leaders on a mission to discover what the law, ethics, and privacy issues truly are. They might become a joke on the sea later. Due to the appearance of the enormous sets of data needed for driving the innovation process, society leaders are required to actively participate in a constructive dialogue to develop the rules and standards in which innovation efforts are balanced with ethical principles of intellectual property rights and privacy.

    "article_detailed_content": "Grayscale Investments has rolled out an important update for the Digital Large Cap (DLC) Fund, its existing product. The organization has liquidated its stake in Cardano (ADA) for an exit in the current quarter. All the money that was left was reinvested in XRP and other similar assets owned by the fund. Restoring the balance of assets requires selling Cardano merchandise. This sale of funds was onward gain fully channeled into an asset purchase. Prominent among these purchases was the acquisition of XRP, which significantly expanded Fundlend’s DLC holdings. Hence, as of the moment of writing this report, XRP is 1.73 % of the fund, or rounded up, it’s 16.7 million tokens. The DLC Management, LLC Fund stores $570,206,758.29 in its assets under management, according to the official website of Grayscale. Grayscale boosts XRP, reduces ADA in DLC fund Bitcoin is considered the first and leading cryptocurrency both in Grayscale’s DLC Fund and throughout the overall crypto market, comprising up to 70.96% of the entire market. Right after, Ethereum has a share of 21.85%. Ethereum’s challengers, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), sit slightly below, owning the following: 4.52% and 0.95%, respectively. Grayscale’s move to change its portfolio was after a reasonable regulatory development period. Importantly, XRP will be included in the DLC undergoing legal actions against the SEC, which presented a legal challenge to its position as a security. As a result of this regulation, Grayscale has attracted speculation from participants in the cryptocurrency market about their plans for XRP. Grayscale’s ETF moves fuel XRP speculation Considering that Grayscale has listed XRP among other cryptocurrencies, this has sparked quite some critique among those in the crypto world. Rather than this, the spotlight has been on the possible Emergence of an XRP contractual exchange-traded fund (ETF). Another element that is driving this speculation is the new spot ETF launches from Grayscale, both for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In light of the fact that provisions to regulate XRP are now clear, it becomes an option to be sought out in related investment products. GrayScale’s move to shift part of the portfolio portrays the firm’s responsiveness to the crypto space’s waves, tides, and regulations. The companies reported that they did not have any plans to add or tilt the DLC fund at the end of Q1 2024.",

    "article_detailed_content": "In a historic event that has changed the tide of the cryptocurrency industry, the trustee decided to sell the biggest part of its Solana (SOL) holdings, around $2 billion, which had the impact of stabilizing the market of cryptocurrencies. The biggest deals in this sales process have Galaxy Trading, Pantera Capital, and Neptune Digital Assets, standing up for almost two-thirds of assets taken by FTX from SOL signaling that the biggest bankrupt exchange battle of the liquidation phase could be the most promising moment of it. A financial strategy that was connected with market recuperation. The FTX estate’s choice to sell away more than 50% of its Solana tokens at a 63% under the present market price announcements has attracted the softloffice tickets of players and venture capitalists all over the world. Such a sales transaction linked to 25-30 million SOL (the locked-up SOL coins) which were priced at $64 per coin resulting the huge sum of $1.9 billion to be taxed to FTX debtors, according to Bloomberg, dated April 5. Such a move is particularly remarkable mainly because FTX was among entities to help fund development of the Solana network, thus FTX is an owner of 41 million SOL tokens which were acquired under a four-year vesting schedule that expire with the beginning of the term when FTX is authorized to sell the tokens on the market. A total coincidence is what this cryptocurrency sale is in favor of with the SOL price stabbed at $176 at the writing time. Such an increase places MEME at 743% above the closing price of the previous day, an extraordinary gain that results from the market recovery and ongoing memecoin craze. The considerable discount in FTX estate sales show that trading process is urgent and strategic in its nature and that the main purpose behind the liquidation process is to create the most beneficial returns for the creditors who are dealing with the rapidly changing circumstances in the exchange bankruptcy. The Dominant Players seize the opportunity The fence expressly drew the attention of several high stature players within the crypto space. Galaxy Trading, that is part of Mike Novogratz’s stellar company, was a prominent member, and indeed two simultaneous sales of tokens were made, the value of which was about $620 million, which is a substantial amount. Thus, the fund management of Galaxy Trading not only expresses trust in the possible outcome of Solana, but also charge a 1% of management fee for investor and is expected to go up as staking is encouraged. The Galaxy Asset subsidiary of the Galaxy Digital group was responsible for a crucial part in the asset sale, underlining how the various assets were to be utilized to the fullest to capitalize on the unique opportunity. Prominent in the investment sector, Panfeiter is supposed to have raised $ 250 million for the acquisition of SOL tokens, according to Bloomberg. While at the same time throughout that day, Neptune Digital Assets, the Canadian blockchain firm , upgraded the sale by purchasing 26,964 SOL tokens at the rate of $64 per coin, which only reinforces the broad base of those that are interested in FTX estate’s liquidation process. Controversy and criticism The enthusiastic response to the SOL token sale on cryptocurrency exchanges and attracting millions of dollars into the blockchain is not without its skeptics. Critics, including creditors of the FTX, have raised questions around the deeply discounted deals, asserting that such choices are the blow to creditors which have right to the property. However, the event was marred by the comments from the then FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried during his marriage on March 28, where he mentioned instances of property disposal at huge discounts, implying that these inconsistencies resulted in considerable market value distortions. The liquidation has also gave the rise to the legal problems, with the creditors sued a class against both Sullivan and Cromwell at the same time, saying the two firms’ actions played part in the fraud culminated in the FTX bankruptcy, and criticism those two firms’ actions in the sell off the assets. This battle of the law is a tangible evidence to the widening network of interest group and responsibility components that have appeared due to the bankruptcy of the FTX. In this sense, it illustrates how all the parties related with the issue of liquidation of one of the crypto market’s most significant collapses are struggling to pull themselves through. The crypto community still follows these research and the liquidation of FTX’s assets that could throw a spanner into the machine and mean more bad things for the market. The SOL token being sold is already important to the very process of clearing up the FTX bankruptcy sycip, further compelling us into analyzing liquidation assets, investment strategies and the myriad of things involved in major exchange breakdowns like this one.",

    "article_detailed_content": "The Council of Europe (CoE) is now designing a general toolkit. In this effort, AI-facilitated instructional and learning approaches will be the focus area, making it human rights-centered, democratic, and governed by the rule of law. The implementation of this toolbox is a great illustration of the CoE’s monumental effort to use the most advanced technologies in education while being very rigorous about protecting the interests of learners in the CoE’s 47 member states. The Council of Europe hosts a pivotal conference to shape future AI education policies AI and education are among the areas that council experts are involved in. They are holding meetings that have been strategically summoned to define the scope, structure, and content of the AI policy toolbox coming soon. These two organizations will collaborate on the Working Conference on ‘Experts AI in Education’, which will be held in Strasbourg from October 24 to 25, 2024. This conference will be viewed as the main integrating channel for multistakeholder consultation meetings, including parallel workshops that lead to an adapted and upgraded toolbox after collecting and analyzing feedback and perspectives. The policy programming grid consists of three domains with distinct programs of action developed to respond to the key concerns of policy formulators. The strategy not only reduces the responsibilities for the onus of integrating AI in educational methods from the partners but also manifests the CoE’s devotion to a technology-based setting where learning power-ups without the infringement of ethical considerations or democratic principles. The Council of Europe’s AI policy toolbox initiative The Policy Toolbox, which will be introduced next, has been developed as the basis for preparing the recommendation on AI-boosted learning in the framework of action within the scope of the CoE jurisdiction. Incorporating this toolkit into the policy developer’s toolbox assures their focus and intentions on a path that cuts through the complex web of AI technology into the educational system and provides them with clear guidelines on how to go about the process. The goal is to create an alignment that can let AI emphasize the improved auto-learning processes that it is so capable of while safeguarding the interests of learners and encouraging the creation of democratized learning experiences. This innovation reflects a growing trend of viewing robust regulatory frameworks as tools to cope with emerging technologies in education and take advantage of them. The mission of the Committee of Experts (CoE) is to establish the ground basis that will ensure AI within education has positive educational outcomes, is its learning access facilitator, and promotes the human dignity and rights of all learners The Council of Europe’s vision for ethical AI in education The Council of Europe’s active and progressive standpoint in the area of AI usage in education reveals its intention to turn this tool into an asset, transforming it for the benefit of society. The main value of Policy Toolbox is to transform AI into an effective tool, providing the education system with new opportunities and a better human future. This image signifies an important milestone in the history of education. On the one hand, the use of technology has made the process of learning more advanced and meaningful, and on the other hand, the culture of educational institutions is shaped by the core principles of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The COE will develop the Policy Toolbox as it winds down. Academics and other education stakeholders who are interested in the education sector eagerly await the end products or outcomes. The information and responses gained from this event will play a vital role in determining the direction of the toolkit so that it can compete with the diverse requirements and obstacles of implementing AI in the world of learning. Policy toolkit: does the Council of Europe for AI-assisted learning development signify inextinguishable growth of ethical issues in deploying technology for education? Such a development tells the relevance of multi-participants, including other international bodies and countries, in adapting to AI demands in education, as well as considering beneficial equity and transparency.

    "article_detailed_content": "The promise of freedom from centralized entities like governments(China and the US), banks, and other financial institutions fuels the entire cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin’s technology is undoubtedly sophisticated enough to take care of itself; however, the government’s increased stimulus plans have continued to raise issues. In general, bitcoin maxis and the cryptocurrency community are increasingly becoming concerned about the continued uptake of Bitcoin by larger economies like China and the US. Through the DOJ, the US government currently holds more than 200k Bitcoin, making it the leading country in BTC holdings despite needing clear backing for the course. Unlike the US, the Chinese government has repeatedly shown clear intent to own BTC. The Chinese government is the only country rivaling the US in the number of BTC holdings. With approximately 190k Bitcoins, the two countries are positioning themselves as custodians of Bitcoin, raising questions about true decentralization. Potential Threats China and the US pose to Decentralization. Bitcoin thrives on decentralization and freedom for its users. When large economies like the US and China continue to amass Bitcoin, there is a potential threat to centralize holdings, undermining the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies in general. Additionally, the mass adoption of Bitcoin by authorities like China and the US can significantly impact regulation. The regulatory influence of these governments can hinder the natural growth of these cryptocurrencies. Continued adoption of Bitcoin by China and the US can create stricter regulations that can easily affect its use and distribution. Additionally, government involvement can easily shape mass opinion and alter market dynamics that are seemingly happening organically at the moment. Governance concerns can also become significant when different independent countries challenge the primary principles of decentralization. According to Blockworks Tweet, the DOJ has a lot of Bitcoin and might be planning to sell a large chunk of it. The tweet sparked a debate on Twitter, with many Americans expressing their discontent. Some crypto enthusiasts mentioned that the DOJ did not receive the enormous Bitcoin holdings legally, while others noted that Americans should at least get a share of what the government currently holds in BTC. Despite these sentiments, it is clear that Bitcoin still remains the pillar of cryptocurrencies and demonstrates the potential to revolutionize the financial scene. Looking at the maximum supply of Bitcoin (21 million), the current holdings by governments are negligible. The Top ten countries holding Bitcoin are the USA, China, the UK, Germany, Ukraine, El Salvador, Finland and Georgia. These countries hold 566,277 Bitcoin, with a current market value of $38,755,796,139. Out of the 21 million Bitcoins, these ten countries hold 2.697% of the total supply as of March 2024. These figures, however not threatening, should shed insight into the possible increase in BTC uptake by governments like China and the US, threatening decentralization.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Introduction As we approach the conclusion of the third epoch, the countdown to the next Bitcoin halving is firmly underway. The halving (also known as the “Halvening”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on or around April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period — or epoch — will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it’s true that Bitcoin’s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you’re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin’s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it’s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin’s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin’s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin’s second halving. Halving: Date: July 9, 2016 Halving number: 01 Block height: 420,000 Block reward: 12.5 Mined supply: 15,750,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 2,625,000 Percentage of mined supply: 12.5% BITCOIN HALVING 2020 The 2020 halving was Bitcoin’s third halving. Halving: Date: May 20, 2020 Halving number: 03 Block height: 630,000 Block reward: 6.25 Mined supply: 18,375,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 1,312,500 Percentage of mined supply: 6.25% BITCOIN HALVING 2024 The 2024 halving will be Bitcoin’s third halving. Halving: Date: April 20, 2024 (estimated) Halving number: 04 Block height: 840,000 Block reward: 3.125 Mined supply: 19,687,500 (amount of bitcoin issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 656,250 Percentage of mined supply: 3.125% FUTURE BITCOIN HALVINGS The blocktime variable will introduce some variance in estimated halving dates, but it is possible to project approximate dates until the conclusion of block subsidies in 2140. Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones. Epoch Number Block height Halving Year Estimated Halving Date 04 (of 32) 840,000 2024 April 20, 2024 05 (of 32) 1,050,000 2028 2028 06 (of 32) 1,260,000 2032 2032 07 (of 32) 1,470,000 2036 2036 08 (of 32) 1,680,000 2040 2040 09 (of 32) 1,890,000 2044 2044 10 (of 32) 2,100,000 2048 2048 11 (of 32) 2,310,000 2052 2052 12 (of 32) 2,520,000 2056 2056 (cont…) HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE BITCOIN HALVING Halving events have consistently preceded significant increases in bitcoin’s price, making them a focal point for market analysts. Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin’s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network’s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin’s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin’s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin’s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it’s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it’s wise to remember that bitcoin’s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it’s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.",

    "article_summary": "A comprehensive history of the events leading up to the historic Executive Order 6102 under FDR that led to widespread gold confiscation in the United States.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Introduction Ninety-one years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it’s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners’ interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it’s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it’s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn’t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there’s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don’t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR’s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that “without his New Deal, we would all have been lost.”2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and “accustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.”3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR’s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America’s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), “rule by personal decree”4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans’ rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency “Now, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes” - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I’m not sure anyone’s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), ‘disregarding the laws for good objects’ has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit ‘extra-constitutional’ exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt’s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is “national emergency”. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you’re an American adult, it’s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the ‘anti-terrorism’ provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it’s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the ‘national emergency’ has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these ‘emergencies’, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.” This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: “I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist…” Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It’s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn’t the case in 1933. So what was FDR’s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship’s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was “trading with the enemy”, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. “But”, (I hear you interject), “By what definition could an ‘American with gold’ be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn’t even a war in 1933!” Fantastic points, and you’re right to make them. To preface the answer, let’s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major ‘philosophies’ that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn’t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these ‘philosophies’ help judges decide the ‘right’ way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that’s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the ‘meaning’ of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A ‘Living Constitution’ approach: where you basically say, ‘to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today’. The third approach is more or less how the law around ‘national emergencies’ has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate ‘natural selection’ evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let’s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase “national emergency” passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America’s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin’ violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to “define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.”8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, “perhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.”10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in “foreign exchange”, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we’re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we’re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President’s power in 1917 was still limited to “during the time of war.”13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR’s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank’s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would “no longer take responsibility” for the bank’s “deficient reserves”.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a ‘gold standard’ was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government’s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, “all of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.”16 FDR’s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the “unscrupulous money changers”, and the “falsity of material wealth”, and demanded that “there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.”17 Now, if you’ve been paying attention, you shouldn’t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a “broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.”18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR’s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a ‘Bank Holiday’ from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the “hoarding”.19 Stopping the run wasn’t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting “the names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.”20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate “any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.”21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR’s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce “during time of war”, or crucially, “during any other period of national emergency declared by the President.” FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: “HOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty”22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn’t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn’t control; Government wasn’t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn’t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don’t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland’s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

Gryphon is taking a bold step in #ESG leadership by publishing its #carbonemissions data publicly. Insight into our 100% renewable status is available here: https://t.co/1DV7bCYIp1 $GRYP #GryphonDigital pic.twitter.com/69jT2nCjWw — Gryphon Digital Mining (@GryphonMining) March 26, 2024 Gryphon Digital Mining uses CarbonChain, an organization that monitors corporate carbon emissions, to track its carbon footprint. CarbonChain’s recent report on Gryphon shows that the company has used 100% renewable energy to mine bitcoin thus far in 2024 and 98% renewable energy in 2023, as per Scope 1 and 2 of the report. “We’re 100% renewable, and we’re showing you exactly how it’s calculated,” Gryphon Digital Mining CEO Rob Chang told Bitcoin Magazine. “And we’re not even the ones calculating it. It’s a respected third party doing it,” he added. “There are various levels of transparency that the industry needs, but the fact that the reporting is not uniform can be fixed and should be fixed — and we’re happy to lead the way.” Gryphon currently conducts all of its mining through a hosting contract with Coinmint at a facility located in upstate New York that harnesses 100% hydroelectric power for its operations. While bitcoin mining operations have caused electricity prices to spike in some upstate New York towns, Gryphon’s operation is having the opposite effect. “Our location is in an economic Opportunity Zone, so, if anything, there isn’t much demand [for power] competing against us,” Chang told Bitcoin Magazine. “In fact, the existence of bitcoin mining is providing economic power deployment for the region, because it is actually a stable consumer of power that allows the economic delivery of more power to the area,” he added. Gryphon is looking to expand its operations into other jurisdictions that have supportive regulations around bitcoin mining and that offer favorable economics for mining as well as renewable energy to power its facilities. “If it’s economic and carbon neutral, we’re there,” said Chang. For more information on Gryphon, please visit the company’s website.",

It would be the first Australian ETF to hold $BTC directly. pic.twitter.com/x8nYRNzZra — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 5, 2024 Monochrome filed an application with securities exchange Cboe Australia to list its flagship bitcoin ETF product. The firm expects approval by mid-2024. Unlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application. \"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024,\" said CEO Jeff Yew. \"The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly.\" If approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia. The firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform. Australia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures. The fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.",

The country has taken an institutional interest in Bitcoin, with its sovereign fund purchasing BTC since prices were around $5,000. Bhutan announced last year it was raising $500 million to boost mining operations. By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining. The new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue. Bhutan cited offsetting the halving's impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000. The remote Himalayan nation has also viewed Bitcoin mining as a way to boost rural economies and jobs.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Morgan Stanley is working to become the first major U.S. banks to offer a spot Bitcoin ETFs to all clients, according to social media reports. With $1.5 trillion in assets under management respectively, Morgan Stanley is one of the largest wealth managers worldwide. A fully approve Bitcoin ETF trading on its platform would mark a pivotal moment for institutional Bitcoin adoption. The reports come from Bitcoin insider Andrew on X and Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Andrew, an influential Bitcoin commentator, tweeted Morgan Stanley may announce its Bitcoin ETF listing \"days before\" rival UBS. He said global banks have been urgently discussing adding the products. UPDATE: several notes from @MorganStanley execs this AM; salty about @UBS post yesterday. They want to be the first wirehouse to fully approve the #Bitcoin ETF's. - @MorganStanley may announce a few days before @UBS. - interesting that global banks are talking about $BTC ETF's… — Andrew (@AP_Abacus) April 3, 2024 Initially skeptical, Bloomberg's Balchunas agreed the firms are playing a \"compliance game of chicken\" on Bitcoin ETF approvals. But a UBS spokesperson reached out to Bitcoin Magazine for comment, stating that “UBS has no plans to change the conditions for offering spot bitcoin ETFs to clients,” and that the above “social media reports regarding UBS are not accurate.” A potential upcoming Morgan Stanley launch would mark a major milestone for Bitcoin's mainstream acceptance. Morgan Stanley adding BTC ETF trading would be a stunning U-turn after CEO James Gorman said last year he didn't think Bitcoin had much uptake as an institutional asset class. Access could be imminent, pending strict compliance reviews. But a green light would still represent a watershed moment for Bitcoin. Major wealth managers offering ETF trading would convey growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity and expose millions of new investors to the market. Being a leader in Bitcoin ETFs could attract billions in new client assets. The moves also signal growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity among the world's banking elite. The accelerating FOMO to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs for giants like Morgan Stanley further validates Bitcoin's promise. Other wealth managers will likely quickly follow their lead. As game theory takes hold, Bitcoin's march towards the mainstream financial system gains irresistible momentum. Significant bank adoption may be closer than many imagine.",

    "article_detailed_content": "In the 1997 book The Sovereign Individual, William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson make a convincing case that again and again throughout history, the dominant power of the day was disrupted by new technologies. Advances in agriculture meant that people and their property were often geographically stationary, making them sitting ducks for “specialists in violence”, the predecessors to modern governments, who back then, were both the plunderers and protectors against plunder. The stirrup, contoured saddle, spur, and curb bit had a combined similar disrupting effect, shifting power away from heavy cavalry to a single armed knight. The Gunpowder Revolution disrupted the feudal order of the day, reinforced in those days by the Catholic Church. Rees-Mogg and Davidson write, “the Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system.” The printing press disrupted the Church even further: causing it to lose its monopoly on biblical narrative. The result was a major loss in its influence and power, which gave way to the modern nation state. Rees-Mogg and Davidson argue that the microprocessor would inevitably disrupt the nation state in the same way that the printing press disrupted Christendom a few hundred years ago. The internet itself (a globally-interconnected community) and public key cryptography (which protects both communications and property of Bitcoin) are made possible by microprocessors. The present and future One major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the currency front. Since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception, we have been able to transact permissionlessly, borderlessly, and (often) anonymously. Nation states have long been jealous of any challenge to their monopoly on money, and they will spend vast sums of money to ensure that there are no serious monetary rivals. Bitcoin serves as an alternative to that trap, which is why it is under attack by the likes of politicians and the crumbling legacy media. But to transact on Bitcoin, you need miners. No doubt, regulators in the United States and Europe observed as China outlawed Bitcoin mining in 2021, which only resulted in the majority of the hashing power moving from that country to the United States. So while they would probably wish to ban it in the United States and Europe outright, they know that they would only lose both regulatory control and tax revenue from Bitcoin miners by doing so. Thus, for now, not even Elizabeth Warren – the most Bitcoin-hostile legislator in Washington – proposes to outright ban Bitcoin. Instead, she proposes to expand know-your-customer (KYC) rules to essentially all parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as discourage self-custody and privacy-enhancing technologies. Bitcoin does have an important weak point of centralization (for now): the hardware. The University of Cambridge produces industry reports on Bitcoin mining and communicates that, hardware-wise, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin miners report to use an “ASIC” chip for mining Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hashing algorithm produced by Singapore-based company Bitmain, with competitors MicroBT and Canaan trailing behind. Regardless of where Bitmain produces its ASIC chips, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin’s decentralization would be that production of ASIC miners (and the mining itself for that matter) would be dispersed around the world so that no specific region could have a definitive advantage, taking the majority control of the hashing power. A reasonable compromise would be one in which ASIC miners were produced, at scale and in high quality, by at least more manufacturers than there are now, especially across countries that are not politically aligned with one another so that collusion between them would be increasingly unlikely. A second major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front. I once attended a conference in which Peter Thiel participated as a speaker. He said something very close to the following (quoted from my memory): “Bitcoin is a technology that, on net, favors the individual. AI is a technology that, on net, favors the state.” It is the latter technology and its favoring the state that emphasizes the importance of getting it into the hands of as many participants as possible if we are to build a truly decentralized world. One risk to AI’s decentralization is one that Bitcoin has in common: a potential future scenario in which hardware is monitored and must be registered by law. In the case of Bitcoin, that would mean miners must register their ASIC chips. In the case of AI, it could mean that even you or I would need to register graphics processing units (GPUs) above a certain capacity (or, in the case of software, that matrices must be registered). Guillaume Verdon, the name behind the now doxed alias @BasedBeffJesos, highlighted this risk in a podcast with Lex Fridman, arguing that this could “[stop] the open source ecosystem from thriving… by executive order, claiming that open source LLMs are dual-use technologies and should be government-controlled.” Although executive orders could not kill Bitcoin (but could discourage some people from using it), similar reporting requirements for miners would likely, to some degree, impact Bitcoin’s open source ecosystem. A third major battleground worth highlighting is 3D printers, assemblers, and other tools in the “maker” arsenal. This “maker” movement hints at a future solution to the problem of centralization tendencies for Bitcoin and AI. Imagine a world with 3D printers and accompanying tools in most people’s homes. If you could print your own high-quality ASIC Bitcoin miners and GPUs for running large language models (LLMs), decentralization is light-years ahead. We can ignore for a moment the futuristic scenario in which 3D printers and other “maker” tools are used to produce hardware for Bitcoin and AI applications. Even at present, at least one government is looking at the 3D printer with the same skeptical eye that the Catholic Church had for the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. New York State’s Assembly Bill A8132, if passed into law, would require criminal background checks, with fingerprints sent to the FBI, in order to purchase 3D printers “capable of creating firearms.” It is reasonable to expect that various governments, fearing loss of their own centralized power, will continue to push registration and “KYC” requirements to maintain control of real-space tools that facilitate decentralization in cyberspace. Note: The Soviet Union had similar controls on seemingly harmless products such as books, photocopiers, fax machines – all of which facilitated the spread of information, and thus, threatened the regime. There were similar efforts to control the sale of fabric that could be used to build hot air balloons in East Germany, to stop people from escaping to West Germany. (See the 1982 American film Night Crossing and the 2018 German film Balloon that both document a real escape). Localized manufacturing, whether at home or in a so-called community fabrication laboratory or “fab lab”, is likely to come under increased hostility by various governments as 3D printers and other “maker” tools are able to produce even more sophisticated electronics. But, for now at least, fab labs are growing exponentially in number, with well over 2,000 of them spread around the world so far, and even receive various levels of support by governments. These fab labs, by the way, don’t account for the many more personalized labs in people’s homes. Neil Gershenfeld at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms tries to understand what the world looks like when almost anybody can make almost anything and when machines can make other machines, even machines more sophisticated than themselves, and often with locally-sourced materials. Gershenfeld argues in a podcast appearance that localized manufacturing doesn’t scale and that production is generally for personal use, not commercial sale. But when many thousands of people around the world learn how to locally produce their own 3D-printed and home-assembled Bitcoin miner and then combine their individual hashing power with others in a mining pool and coordinate with one another over the Tor network… then the world starts to look much more decentralized. Conclusion Bitcoin, AI, and 3D printers share a common theme of decentralization and disruptive potential for the nation state. As both Bitcoin’s ASIC mining chips and GPUs used to run LLMs exist in real-space where nation states are most dominant, governments may become increasingly hostile towards such hardware: requiring criminal background checks, KYC, etc. Interestingly, 3D printers, assemblers, and other “maker” tools could be used now or in the future for localized manufacturing (whether at home or in so-called “fab labs”), enabling a much more decentralized world. Meanwhile, on the policy front, criminal background checks and registration requirements for 3D printers and other “maker” tools such as those proposed in New York’s Assembly Bill A8132 deserve a skeptical eye and strong political pushback.

    "article_summary": "Latin America is quietly being forced into a carbon market scheme through regional contractual obligations – enforced by the satellites of a US intelligence-linked firm – which seeks to create an inter-continental \"smart grid,\" erode national and local sovereignty, and link carbon-based life to the debt-based monetary system via a Bitcoin sidechain.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Sweeping across the shores of Latin America comes a scheme from some of the most predatory figures in the venture capital ecosystem of the United States. It is a brazen attempt to assert foreign influence across Latin America and threatens to reshape the very fabric of the region and the day to day lives of its people. At its core is a serpentine set of contractual obligations, held at the municipal level, cast throughout Central and South America, upheld by an intelligence-linked satellite company, and controlled by a private sector consortium of green-washed financiers aiming to turn the region’s forests into equity and carbon credits. At the same time, it obliges local governments to spend “conservation” funds on projects that further financialize nature and aid the construction of an inter-continental “smart” grid. One of its key ambitions appears to be further entrenching the debt load of the region through the multi-lateral development banks and the dollarization of the continent from the subnational level up through carbon markets upheld by a digital ledger. What seems like a technological marvel aimed at progress and connectivity harbors a darker agenda — one that intertwines planetary surveillance, financial predation, geopolitical maneuvering, and the domination of a resource-rich continent buried in debt. This grand design, known by the acronym GREEN+ and conceived by stalwarts of the digital dollar and debt schemes of the private sector, has quietly taken root through a web of political entanglements at the local level. Even a key figure in the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal plays a role. Astonishingly, every capital city of Latin America has eagerly signed on, apparently unaware of the strings attached to these seemingly benign partnerships, while a majority of municipalities in the region have also made commitments with these same groups that will push them to join GREEN+, potentially in a matter of weeks. The (hopefully) well-meaning regional governments have unwittingly paved the way for a sweeping surveillance apparatus tied to American intelligence that threatens to erode privacy and civil liberties under the guise of progress and combating the climate crisis. Upon further observation, GREEN+'s connections reveal a disturbing narrative of financial interests melding with geopolitical ambitions. The backers of the satellite company share ties with former members of the highest offices of US financial policy and regulation alongside the key architects and profiteers of private capital creation, aiming to consolidate control over monetary flows in Latin America within the redistribution of distressed government debt from the public to the private sector. As this two-part series will show, this concerted effort is not merely about surveillance – it's a calculated move towards further dollarization, tightening the grip of corporate and technological monopolies over the economic landscape of the Americas. The scheme's proponents also speak of how it will significantly advance the \"economic\" and \"regional\" integration of the Americas, invoking visions of unity while obscuring the true nature of their agenda for economic domination and stronger regional governance. Their model, eerily reminiscent of the EU's transition from a free trade union to a bureaucratic behemoth yoked to the US through the Eurodollar, sets the stage for unelected entities to enforce policies through programmable money, enabled by smart contracts on blockchains and designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. What materializes before us is not just a technological evolution but a quiet banker coup — one that lays the groundwork for land grabs and invasive surveillance under the guise of progress and conservation. It's a narrative that echoes throughout history, where intelligence-linked figures and predatory financial interests converge to prey upon the Global South, leaving a trail of economic exploitation and geopolitical manipulation in their wake. What masquerades as progress for individuals and the environment at large may very well be the harbinger of a new era of subjugation and control. GREEN+ The GREEN+ Program In 2022, several groups came together to launch the GREEN+ (Government Reduction of Emissions for Environmental Net + Gain) Jurisdictional Programme, the “first program that will monitor by satellite all subnational protected areas of the planet” and – through contracts with numerous local and state governments – propel and deepen the economic integration of the Americas through the quiet imposition of a continent-wide, blockchain-based carbon market. GREEN+ has been piloted in a handful of Latin American cities since its founding and is due to launch globally in just a few weeks time. Most of the GREEN+ agreements with “subnational” governments have remained focused on Latin America. Per the program, the subnational agreements have established the “rules and requirements to enable accounting and crediting with GREEN+ policies and measures and/or nested projects, implemented as GHG mitigation activities,” with GREEN+ being described as “the planet's new subnational government advisory mechanism.” Key to the program are the services provided by GREEN+ founding member Satellogic, an Argentina-founded company closely aligned with Peter Thiel’s Palantir and Elon Musk’s SpaceX that specializes in sub-meter resolution satellite surveillance. Satellogic, a contractor to the US government and whose founders were also previously contactors for the US’ DHS, NSA and DARPA, will provide surveillance data of the entire world’s “protected areas” to GREEN+’s governing coalition, composed of the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network, The Energy Coalition and other “respected stakeholders.” According to the press release that details Satellogic’s alliance with GREEN+, the satellite surveillance data “will enable individuals, organizations, and global markets to accurately monitor the compliance of signatory jurisdictions to avoid deforestation.” However, other information in the press release reveals that forests will actually be monitored for the purpose of generating “credible” carbon credits to be traded on exchanges by GREEN+ on behalf of subnational governments. The press release also states that the GREEN+ alliance with Satellogic will “advance the future measurement of energy emissions in the most populated areas of the planet,” i.e. the surveillance of carbon emissions from space. Satellogic launched some GREEN+-affiliated satellites in 2022 as part of its pilot and is due to launch the remainder this April during Miami Climate Week. Satellogic’s past and upcoming launches of GREEN+ satellites were/will be conducted in collaboration with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, also a contractor to the US military and US intelligence agencies. Satellogic and GREEN+ Though framed as a way to develop economic incentives to mitigate climate change, the program is based on California’s controversial and grift-prone cap and trade program and has been created (and is being implemented by) individuals and companies that are seeking to covertly dollarize Latin America and/or have deep ties to US intelligence. Its ultimate ambitions go far beyond carbon markets and seek to use satellite surveillance to enforce carbon emission levels in both urban and rural areas. It also seeks to impose a new financial system centered around energy, commodity, and natural resource “credits” that are underpinned by extensive and invasive surveillance, underscored by the motto: “Earth observation is preservation.” The alliance that created GREEN+ includes the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network (GFN), Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Catalytic Finance Foundation (CFF, formerly R20) and The Energy Coalition (TEC); the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas; the global insurance giant Lockton; the satellite company Satellogic; the “green” blockchain company EcoRegistry; the dominant carbon credit certifier in Latin America, Cercarbono; and Rootstock (RSK), the bitcoin side-chain protocol responsible for “smart BTC.” Several members of the alliance, though how many is unclear, now operate as part of a consortium linked to a company called Global Carbon Parks, which is discussed in greater detail later in this article and now manages major aspects of GREEN+. The NGOs (i.e. CC35, GFN, CFF and TEC) involved in founding GREEN+ are those who actually govern the GREEN+ program from California. As previously mentioned, the program takes carbon in “effectively conserved protected areas of a sub-national jurisdiction”, i.e. a city, county, province, or state/region, and converts them into carbon credits. Per the program, “these credits are traded on the [carbon] offset market, and income is deposited in a trust fund” that is controlled by GREEN+ and is known as the GREEN+ Trust. That trust is run by unspecified individuals who work for Lockton, Isolas and Rootstock. Alejandro Guerrero, head of Lockton’s Argentina & Uruguay branch, is the only publicly acknowledged member of the trust. Another website tied to the GREEN+ initiative describes the initial process as follows: Public and private agreements between [a subnational] government and custodians are signed with zero upfront cost. Custodians trade the carbon units that are produced by the subnational governments (the public sector) signing contracts with the private sector in voluntary carbon markets. Those contracts signed by the subnational governments become smart contracts and carbon credits are then tokenized for traceability. The GREEN+ Trust holds government funds in escrow. Subsequently, “a partial release of trust funds is made periodically during the crediting period of the jurisdictional initiative.” From this “partial release,” “a percentage operational fee” is deducted (the percentage is undisclosed in the program’s documents) and paid to the GREEN+ program while a separate (and also undisclosed) fee is also deducted “for the operation of the GREEN+ Trust.” Disbursements of what remains are made annually over a ten year period and, per graphs produced by GREEN+, those payments remain the same, fixed value even if the value of the carbon credits of the protected areas grows. From GREEN+ Between 40% and 60% of the funds actually received by subnational governments can be used to “design and execute projects” aimed at conservation, while the rest “is allocated for new jurisdictional decarbonisation initiatives” that can produce additional or “consequential” carbon credits. These “consequential” credits are then “offered as a preferred option to the investors who initially purchased the conservation credits at a 50% discounted price calculated at the current market price.” However, later in the same document, the program says that “the amount required for the initial implementation” of conservation projects “may not exceed 20% of the funds allocated [from the GREEN+ Trust] to the jurisdictional initiative.” Clearly, the amount of funds actually being generated for conservation-related projects is minimal and, even in the best case scenario, is less than half of the capital generated by the carbon credits themselves. However, as we shall see, these “conservation” projects must be done in conjunction with approved partners of Global Carbon Parks, which – like the organization itself – are tied to predatory financial interests and oligarchs with questionable motives. Of the funds that governments actually receive as part of GREEN+, half are officially meant to go toward conservation-related projects while the other half are meant to go toward decarbonization-related projects. However, on the Global Carbon Parks-GREEN+ website, it notes that the decarbonization projects must be conducted alongside Community Electricity, which forms part of Global Carbon Parks and is closely connected to the GREEN+ alliance member The Energy Coalition (TEC). As will be discussed later, TEC and Community Electricity are together attempting to build an inter-continental “smart” grid in the Americas and are also involved in efforts to develop “smart” cities and suburbs. As for GREEN+’s conservation projects, the website states that “50% of the resources received by the capital [city as part of GREEN+] must be used for social and environmental impact in protected urban areas with partners such as Cities4Forests.” Cities4Forests was founded by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a World Economic Forum affiliate and contractor to suspected CIA front USAID that is focused on resource “sustainability.” WRI is funded by the US and several European governments, billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg as well as Google, Meta/Facebook, the Soros family’s Open Societies Foundations, the UN, Walmart, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, among others. WRI’s Cities4Forests shares many of the same funding sources, such as the governments of the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US as well as the World Bank and the Caterpillar Foundation. Other funders include the Wall Street giant Citi Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB recently teamed up to create the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which has spearheaded the financialization of nature via the creation of Natural Asset Corporations (NACs). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, NACs create corporations that take control of natural assets that were previously part of the “commons,\" such as forests, rivers and lakes, and then sell shares of those assets to Wall Street asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and other financial institutions in order to generate profit under the guise of “conserving” the asset they target. From GREEN+ Unsurprisingly, most of Cities4Forests’ projects, such as those that would be built with GREEN+ funds, are similar to NACs in that they focus on using natural assets and “natural capital” to produce new financial and insurance products. Examples of Cities4Forests “conservation” projects include the development of a Forest Resilience Bond and the India Forum for Nature-based Solutions. One of the India-based forum’s “core partners” is the Nature Conservancy, which has been run by Wall Street bankers for years and has pioneered the modern iteration of the controversial “debt for conservation” swap among other “nature-based solutions.” The funders of Cities4Forest and its creator the WRI are also deeply affiliated with groups like the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and UN-backed climate finance initiatives that openly seek to use debt imperialism to herd the global economy, with a focus on emerging markets, into a new system of global financial governance. Thus, the “conservation” and “decarbonization” efforts that subnational governments must enact as part of their contractual agreements with GREEN+ will go towards projects tied to either the smart grid/smart city developer Community Electricity or a “conservation” organization backed by Western oligarchs, multi-national corporations and banks that seeks to financialize and monetize nature under the guise of conserving it. CC35 and the Subnational Pivot CC35, or Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Climático (American Capital Cities Facing Climate Change), is the most visible organization behind the GREEN+ program and one of the members of its governance committee. CC35’s goal is the economic integration of the Americas (North, South and Central) through coordinated climate change policies, specifically the creation of an Inter-American carbon market, with GREEN+ being the means of implementing that market. The group focuses on “subnational” governments, namely capital cities of the Americas, thereby circumventing national governments with respect to Climate Change-related policy. Regarding GREEN+, Sebastián Navarro, the secretary general of CC35, stated of the program that: “We will be relentless from the governance of the GREEN+ program with those who want to continue playing with the future of humanity,” adding that their “relentless” approach would be greatly aided by Satellogic’s satellite surveillance capabilities, which would also “generate unprecedented credibility among investors of the carbon credits produced by conservation.” Navarro’s promise to be “relentless” in governing a satellite surveillance regime of American forests for the purpose of producing “high-credibility” carbon markets. Sebastián Navarro of CC35 While framed as an initiative “born out of Latin America,” CC35 is registered in Miami; Florida (Coral Gables, specifically) and has long been funded and partnered with US-based interests. For instance, CC35’s first partners were R20 (Regions of Climate Action, now the Catalytic Finance Foundation), a group created by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in partnership with the UN, and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. From there, CC35 partnered with UN and UN-linked organizations as well as Pegasus Capital Advisors, which also finances CC35 and Schwarzenegger’s R20/Catalytic Finance Foundation. R20/Catalytic Finance, like CC35, focuses its attention on “subnational” governments. Pegasus Capital is the firm created by Craig Cogut, a key figure in the “junk bond” financial scandal at the now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel’s junk bond department, led by Michael Milken, engaged in blatantly illegal activity and used junk bonds to help fuel the takeovers of major corporations by the era’s infamous “corporate raiders” before the bank’s collapse. Specifically, Cogut was the lawyer who advised the Milken-run and scandal-ridden junk bond department on the legality of transactions, including those that saw Milken become a convicted felon. Following Drexel’s collapse, Cogut teamed up with a group of Drexel alumni led by Leon Black – now best known for his close association with the deceased sex trafficker and \"financial adviser\" Jeffrey Epstein – to co-found Apollo Advisers (now Apollo Global Management) in 1990. Cogut left Apollo to found Pegasus in 1996 and Pegasus has since became a key player in several UN-supported “green” finance initiatives. Cogut is also financially entangled with Satellogic’s co-founder, Emiliano Kargieman, as will be discussed later. Cogut subsequently became a board member of Arizona State University’s Global Institute of Sustainability, which was created by Michael Crow (and who served on the board alongside Cogut). Crow is chairman of the board of trustees In-Q-tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Cogut also served on the board of ASU’S McCain Institute, named for the late Senator John McCain, which has links to Ashton Kutcher’s CIA-linked charity Thorn. Current board members of the McCain Institute include both Crow and former CIA director David Petraeus on its board, as well as Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-created the Council for Inclusive Capital with the Vatican. Cogut was also on the board of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), part of the Clinton family philanthropies, and CHAI was largely shaped and influenced by notorious sex trafficker and “financial advisor for billionaires” Jeffrey Epstein, having been the chief reason for former president Bill Clinton’s flights on Epstein’s plane in the early 2000s. Notably, Cogut is not the only Drexel alum to be involved in “green finance.” The field of “green finance” itself was essentially invented by Richard Sandor, who made millions at Drexel during the 1980s, pioneering “innovative” products like the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), which would later contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. Sandor had previously been deemed the “father of financial futures” and is also credited with helping create derivatives. After Drexel’s collapse, Sandor moved on to pioneering carbon emissions trading and carbon markets with the vision of creating “an all-electronic exchange for carbon trading,” a vision that has since taken shape. Craig Cogut of Pegasus Capital CC35 has long been led by Sebastián Navarro. Under his leadership, CC35 helped broker the creation of the Subnational Climate Fund, which is backed by Cogut’s Pegasus Capital along with BNP Paribas, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bloomberg Philanthropies and the governments of Germany, the UK, Australia and the Netherlands. That fund focuses on financing infrastructure projects in the Global South at the subnational (e.g. city, state) level, again bypassing national governments. Indeed, the main modus operandi of CC35 is brokering contracts between small, subnational governments and “green” finance entities that are tied to centers of US/European political or financial power. Navarro is listed as a director of CC35 as are two prominent, right-leaning Latin American politicians: Felipe Alessandri Vergara, mayor of the Chilean capital Santiago from 2016 to 2021, and Nasry Asfura Zablah, former mayor of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and former Honduran presidential candidate. Alessandri is a well-known figure in Chilean center-right politics and an ally of the recently deceased former Chilean president Sebastián Piñera. Alessandri is controversial within the Chilean right for his covert support of initiatives generally favored by the left and publicly shunned by his party while serving as Santiago’s mayor, such as climate finance/regional economic integration (via CC35) and his financing of initiatives related to illegal immigration. Alessandri’s successor and supposed political nemesis, Irací Hassler of Chile’s Communist Party, has since taken over for Alessandri as CC35’s Vice President for South America. As for Nasry Asfura, he was the subject of a Honduran political scandal due to his appearance in the Pandora Papers and his alleged involvement in suspicious offshore finance activities. He was also indicted on money laundering and fund embezzlement, but charges were dropped under Asfura’s successor Jorge Aldana, who is now president of CC35. The current vice president of CC35 for Central America is Mario Durán, the mayor of San Salvador and a close ally of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele as well as a member of Bukele’s Nuevas Ideas party. Durán is poised to take over the leadership of CC35 per a recent announcement from the group. In 2021, Durán signed a contract with CC35 regarding education about the use of Bitcoin in all metropolitan region municipalities in El Salvador, and is the only mention of CC35 promoting the use of Bitcoin. As will be noted again later on, the CC35-led GREEN+ initiative is partnered with Rootstock, which created and develops a Bitcoin sidechain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presumably, the goal is to run GREEN+’s digital carbon market on the same blockchain. While it may seem odd to an American audience that “regional integration” efforts under the guise of climate change would be led largely by right-leaning politicians, it is important to point out that such integration efforts have historically been led by both left and right factions in Latin America, who compete for dominance over the region. For instance, right-leaning efforts at economically and/or politically integrating the Americas include Mercosur (the Southern Common Market, now championed by the “anti-globalist” Javier Milei) and Prosur (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America, launched by Chile’s center-right Piñera). Left-leaning efforts include ALADI (Latin American Integration Association) and UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). All of these efforts have failed due to geopolitical disagreements mainly centered around whether to grant membership to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and others with governments estranged from the so-called “Washington consensus” or, more recently, efforts to forge closer ties to Russia and/or China. Given that several important Latin American countries can suddenly change what side of the “consensus” they are on depending on presidential election results, such as recently happened in Brazil and Argentina, these regional integration efforts have failed to gain significant traction over the last several decades. Nevertheless, the end goal of economic integration begetting political integration remains the same. Thus, as CC35 shows, the push to regionally integrate Latin America has now, very quietly, pivoted away from engagement at the national level to the subnational level. Aurelio Peccei at the 3rd Annual WWF Congress in 1973 The Club of Rome’s Global Footprint While CC35 is the most visible face of GREEN+’s governing body, it is actually chaired by a group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The GFN exists to promote “the Ecological Footprint, which tracks how much nature we use and how much we have, as an accounting tool” for green finance initiatives and originated the concept of “ecological debt” based on that metric. Elsewhere, the GFN calls for “one-planet prosperity” and emphasizes climate finance, a field dominated by predatory Wall Street banks and billionaires, as an economic imperative. They work with governments at both the national and subnational level and establish the carbon emissions limits for localities, states and countries that programs like GREEN+ seek to enforce with satellite surveillance and binding contractual obligations. The GFN is intimately connected to the Club of Rome. For instance, GFN’s founder and a member of its board, Mathis Wackernagel, who also co-created the Ecological Footprint concept, is a member of the Club of Rome. Wackernagel’s former mentor and the other developer of the Ecological Footprint, William Rees, was a member of the Club of Rome until 2018. Heiko Specking, a GFN board member, is also affiliated with the Club of Rome as is another GFN board member, Lewis Akenji. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 by the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King. Its earliest success was the 1972 report and later book “The Limits to Growth,\" which was based on an MIT study and claimed that “if the world’s consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.” The book was heavily promoted by the earliest annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, particularly in 1973. Peccei, who spent a large part of his life living in Argentina, had previously been a member of ADELA, the Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America. ADELA was composed of powerful Western companies that pooled money to invest in Latin American companies of their choosing, essentially “king-making” the titans of the Latin American corporate world. ADELA’s backers included Bank of America, IBM, Fiat (where Peccei was an executive), and the Rockefeller family’s Standard Oil. The group was part of the Rockefeller-dominated network in Latin America, which also included the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), which has been linked to the 1973 CIA-backed military coup in Chile through the Chilean Rockefeller associate Agustín Edwards, and Deltec, best known today as a main bank for the failed crypto exchange FTX and its close relationship with the stablecoin Tether. Modern iterations of this network include Endeavor and the Council of the Americas (CoA), which will be discussed in the second part of this series. Notably, it was Peccei’s speech at an ADELA conference that spurred his partnership with Alexander King and led to the Club of Rome’s formation. At the time he got involved with Peccei and made the Club of Rome, King was head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD was originally established as the OEEC to help administer the post-WWII, US-developed Marshall Plan and was later expanded to become a global organization in 1961. The US remains the OECD’s main funder by a significant margin. The group has long claimed to promote “sustainable economic growth” and “consistently improving standard of living in its member countries,” but – in practice – it routinely favors neoliberal policies that enrich Western-based multi-national corporations. It is closely partnered with entities like the IMF, the World Bank and the broader multi-lateral development banking system that has used debt slavery sold as “economic development” to privatize state-owned assets and sell them off to privileged corporate interests. That system has also been considered by the US military to be part of its arsenal of “financial weapons” used to protect US interests abroad. The Club of Rome was criticized for many decades for embracing neo-Malthusian thought (i.e. eugenics and specifically population control measures in the developing world) as well as for promoting greater global governance. Some of its members have championed the imposition of a “benevolent” global dictatorship. Criticisms of the Club of Rome have been voiced by academia as well as independent and mainstream media. The group’s attempt to rebrand as an environmental group in order to gain popular support for those same policies was discussed in their 1991 book “The First Global Revolution,” which states: “In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.” The Global Footprint Network’s methods, products and ideology are very much aligned with the neo-Malthusian “Limits to Growth” view of the Club of Rome as well as the efforts to incorporate nature into financial markets via so-called “nature-based solutions.” Indeed, the GFN’s ecological footprint metric is promoted by groups like the World Economic Forum and the World Wildlife Fund (where Peccei served on the board and which has long been tied to European oligarch and corporate interests). GFN also provides the statistical means of imposing Limits to Growth-style models that control both population levels and industrialization levels on governments by developing “ecological budgets” that, as evidenced by GREEN+, are now interfacing directly with carbon markets. Building a “GREEN” Power Monopoly The other member of the GREEN+ governing committee that will control the program as well as Satellogic’s surveillance data is The Energy Coalition (TEC). Notably, it was TEC’s executive director Craig Perkins who said that GREEN+ would also enable the surveillance of carbon emissions of populated areas, presumably via satellite. TEC was founded by John Phillips, who ran Phillips Energy – an oil and gas company, in 1975. Since 1979, it has been closely partnered with local California governments via its Community Energy Partnership program. Currently, TEC is partnered with, and some of its key initiatives are financed by, major California gas companies, referred to by TEC as California’s “investor-owned utilities.” These include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, SDGE and SoCalGas. With the backing of these major oil and gas companies, TEC assures us it is “creating the building blocks for a new energy economy.” One of its main partners in doing so is Community Electricity, which claims to be “building the NASDAQ of the clean energy field.” TEC and Community Electricity, which is backed by Google, have co-designed “a master plan” financed by the California Energy Commission “to implement the largest and first-of-its-kind decarbonization by electrification protocols using DERs [distributed energy resources], carbon emissions management, blockchain, AI and IoT [internet of things] all connected under one plug-and-play platform.” Community Electric designs, funds and develops this technology for GluHomes (formerly GluEnergy), its parent company which shares the same founder as Community Electricity – Felipe Cano. The program is being piloted in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as well as in disadvantaged communities in Colombia. The goal, per Cano, is to “bring the Americas together” through an inter-continental, “clean” smart grid. Helena Donoso, Samuel Garcia, Felipe Cano, Santiago F. Maldonado, and Sebastian Navarro The blockchain involved in these efforts is RSK, the smart contract-oriented sidechain that runs on top of the Bitcoin network. As previously mentioned, RSK is a founding member of GREEN+. The initiative involving TEC, Community Electricity, California’s government, and RSK also seeks “to digitize carbon credit reporting” and to “create opportunities for businesses to redeem credits.” The Community Electricity/TEC program also uses the RSK blockchain to record a person’s energy usage “with the help of RIF, an identity product [i.e. digital identity] developed by RSK Labs.” The Community Electricity system requires a digital ID tied to a digital wallet that “is embedded to store daily profits derived from surplus energy sales” that allow electricity consumers to trade energy credits and become what the company calls “prosumers,” with the goal of creating “an energy social network.” The Community Electricity hardware produced with GluHomes also “utilize[s] AI and machine learning to transform any home intro a smart micro electricity generation utility.” The group is partnering with real estate developers to develop smart homes connected to their energy-related technology, with a focus on social housing and affordable housing, i.e. housing for lower income families. The goal is to connect together retro-fitted existing homes, new smart homes, a neighborhood co-op of electric vehicles and a reward-payment system called GluPay, which is partnered with Mastercard and Contigo, which designs products “for the unbanked, immigrants, homeless and disadvantaged population,” with a focus on remittance payments. Contigo is currently in talks with El Salvador’s government to have the company’s “Payments Wallet tied into the Salvadoran financial inclusion products.” Contigo is run by Raul Hinojosa, an academic at UCLA who wrote a book entitled “Convergence and Divergence between NAFTA, Chile, and MERCOSUR: Overcoming Dilemmas of North and South American Economic Integration,” which focuses on “the impact of a potential Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.” The creator of Community Electricity and GluHomes, Felipe Cano has also spent most of his career attempting to economically integrate large swathes of the world. For instance, in 1998, his vision was “to unify both European and US stock exchanges under one platform and protocol, the create the smart grid of the equity market and stock trading in a bilateral, single network.” This vision led him to create ECN Access, which “was the first tech hub in Europe to route the first block of institutional order flows from a European Bank directly to the NASDAQ electronic exchange without intermediaries,” creating what Cano calls “the first smart grid every built.” He then sought to “create a digital market for the energy sector,” which has since culminated in his creation of Community Electricity and GluHomes. Cano is an adviser to TEC and is also a senior partner at Silverbear Capital, where he focuses on investments related to smart cities. According to his bio at Silverbear, Cano is also CEO of “Olidata Smart Cities LLC, a market-maker platform which uses nano-grids and microgrids as the underlying strategy to deploy the Internet of Things Protocol of the future.” Cano was also, until recently, the president of Global Carbon Parks, which is a consortium of companies, the only known members of which all happen to be companies that founded GREEN+, with the one exception being Cano’s Community Electricity. Global Carbon Parks, unsurprisingly, is now one of the main implementers of the GREEN+ program. Global Carbon Parks is also partnered with Aclima, a start-up backed by Microsoft and the foundation of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Global Carbon Park’s stated mission is to “transform protected areas into natural equity” via public-private partnerships, essentially admitting that the GREEN+ program it now helps manage is about financializing protected natural assets and resources. Felipe Cano - GluHomes Inc Global Carbon Parks “transforms” these forests into “natural equity” by measuring, certifying and trading carbon credits in conjunction with the carbon credit certification Cercarbono (discussed later in this article). Their partnership with Satellogic, which goes beyond but also includes the GREEN+ program, uses satellite surveillance “to ensure the integrity of the preserved area” which contains the carbon represented by the carbon credits. The company also promotes their integration with The Energy Coalition and Community Electricity to develop “advanced electricity communities” that develop “renewable energy credits,\" which the company claims will “contribute to local wealth creation.” The company is partnered with a financial firm, which does the actual trading of carbon credits for both Global Carbon Parks and presumably GREEN+. However, Global Carbon Parks declines to reveal their identity, merely stating that “They are a financial firm that integrates technical, economic, and environmental solutions.” In summary, the governance of the GREEN+ program and the group with control over its satellite surveillance data; are tied to or funded by groups that have long used debt as a form of control over the Global South in particular; seek to control the population size and the degree of industrialization in countries; are tied to globalist efforts to economically and politically integrate the Americas; are building a Bitcoin blockchain-based smart grid that surveils and limits energy usage and links energy usage to currency; and are integrating and tokenizing the natural world, including endangered or protected areas, into the financial system under the guise of conservation. Through CC35’s Alcades por el Clima (Mayors for the Climate) initiative, over 15,000 local governments in Latin America have signed agreements with CC35 related to carbon emission trading schemes and limits, led by Brazil (5,564 local governments), Argentina (2,457 local governments), and Mexico (2,481 local governments). Presumably, those carbon neutrality/trading agreements will allow CC35 to push those municipalities into the GREEN+ program, if they aren’t already planning to participate directly (many are). In other words, the vast majority of Latin America, unbeknownst to the vast majority of its populace, is already contractually yoked to one of the main organizations behind the GREEN+ program – run by interests tied to foreign banks, corporations and even intelligence services. The program is set to launch continent-wide in a matter of weeks. As this article and subsequent article will show, what has transpired is a brazen attempt to conduct a silent coup of the continent’s natural resources, energy production, local governments and economy. The GREEN+ Trust and the Bitcoin Carbon Market The GREEN+ Trust, which is to hold and handle the profits from the carbon credits produced and then disburse them to governments if certain conditions are met, is to be managed by individuals “selected from the members institutions of the [GREEN+] Executive Board” as well as from Isolas, Lockton and Rootstock (RSK). According to GREEN+, the Trust is not only responsible for fund custody, but also “the regulation of smart contracts, in coordination with the certification standard [Cercarbono] and the monitoring of mitigation initiatives [conducted by Satellogic].” The only known member of the Trust, as previously mentioned, is Alejandro Guerrero, the head of Lockton’s branch in Argentina and Uruguay. Lockton, a founding member of GREEN+ and also of Global Carbon Parks, is the world’s largest, privately held insurance brokerage firm that also provides risk management services, employee benefits and retirement services. They are owned by the Lockton family and the company – and the family behind it – are rather secretive. However, the company has been overt about the opportunities they see in the type of carbon market that initiatives like GREEN+ will create. In a 2023 article, Lockton’s head of Digital Integration and Special Projects, David Briscoe, wrote that making carbon credits “a stable and trusted currency” would “require the support of the insurance market.” This is because, as Briscoe notes, “voluntary” carbon markets come with risks, particularly because “of the financial values involved.” Per Briscoe, these risks include “non- or under-delivery of forward purchased carbon removal credits,\" “start-ups involved in the voluntary carbon market may face insolvency risks,” and “fraud and negligence.” Indeed, mismanagement and fraud has been a major driver of why carbon markets have failed to catch on despite relentless promotion and the adoption of ESG and climate change plans by many of the most powerful names in finance and industry. Instead of addressing the rampant fraud in carbon credits directly, it appears that the high probability of fraud and insolvency has been seen as an opportunity to create a new market for the insurance industry, with carbon credit insurance being framed as the only “feasible” means of de-risking the fraud-prone world of carbon markets, which have been criticized by environmental groups and have been shown to have a negligible impact on climate. Lockton offers a variety of products related to carbon credits and so do its competitors, with the first such insurance having been issued by the UK-based insurance company Howden in 2022. That product was designed to “increase confidence in the Voluntary Carbon Market” and was “incubated” in collaboration with “the Insurance Task Force of the Sustainable Markets Initiative; an initiative led by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales [now King Charles].” Industry publications have openly posited that carbon credits are likely to be “the next $1 billion insurance market.” Some companies, like Kita and Oka, were created specifically to insure carbon credits. Presumably, Lockton’s involvement with GREEN+ means that Lockton will be insuring the mass of carbon credits to be produced by the program, which plans to harvest carbon credits from all of the world’s “subnational protected areas.” In addition, Lockton’s role as the carbon credits insurer means it will be involved in ensuring that those cities/regions that are to become part of GREEN+ comply with the program’s stipulations in order to receive funds from the trust. RootstockLabs (RSK) Another member of the GREEN+ Trust is RSK, or Rootstock. RSK is a federated sidechain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows smart contract functionality akin to the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the same programming language known as Solidity. In effect, this means that any smart contract that can be designed and authored on Ethereum, such as identity systems, dollar-pegged stablecoins, or tokenized carbon credits, can be “trivially” ported to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin sidechains was first introduced in October 2014 by a group of Bitcoin developers mainly employed by Blockstream, whose November 2014 seed round was led by Reid Hoffman, that gives “bitcoins and other ledger assets” the ability to be “transferred between multiple blockchains” giving new functionality to “assets they already own” without compromising any of the security innate to Bitcoin's blockchain. RSK works by allowing users to deposit funds sent using traditional bitcoin transactions into a wallet controlled by a federation (in this case, a known group of Rootstock-selected key signers) that issues a 1:1 token called Smart Bitcoin, represented by RBTC, which fuels the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine), a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). RBTC is “the native currency” of Rootstock, and is used to pay for the fees required to complete and settle the smart contracts or transactions that take place on the RSK sidechain. RSK was launched in 2015 by RSK Labs, which was acquired by RIF Labs before becoming IOV (“internet of value”) Labs. IOV labs, as of last week, has rebranded once again to become RootstockLabs. It was co-founded by Sergio Lerner, who became the Bitcoin Foundation’s bitcoin core security auditor the same year he conceived of RSK, and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. Gutierrez is the current chairman of RootstockLabs, while Lerner is its chief scientist and they are the president and vice president, respectively, of the IOV Foundation, which enables “interventions that contribute to sustainable development,\" specifically the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on emerging markets and territories. A major goal of the SDGs is to create a new global financial governance system. That system has been described in recent years by top UN climate finance official, central banker, and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Mark Carney, as relying largely on programmable, surveillable digital currencies (namely central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs) and a global carbon market. According to RootstockLabs and its affiliated foundation, the group’s mission is to harness “the power of digital technology, blockchain, and collaboration” to “break down barriers and create a more equitable society.” They also state that Rootstock Labs was created with the intent of creating “a new open financial ecosystem,” while RIF Labs states it (along with RootstockLabs) is “creating a global financial system that works for everyone.” Wences Casares - July 2018 Diego Gutierrez is a long-time associate of Wenceslao (Wences) Casares, an Argentine tech entrepreneur sometimes referred to as the “Peter Thiel of Latin America.” Gutierrez worked with Casares at Argentina’s first Internet service provider, which Casares had launched, and then helped create the Casares-founded Argentinian online brokerage firm Patagon that was later sold to Spanish banking giant Santander. Casares, like Gutierrez, is a long-time promoter and early adopter of Bitcoin and is allegedly responsible for pitching the promise of Bitcoin to elites, like Bill Gates and LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman. Hoffman once referred to Casares as Bitcoin’s “patient zero” in terms of Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin. Forbes has even referred to Casares as “crypto royalty who ran with the original gang of Bitcoin OGs.” Casares subsequently became a board member of PayPal and also part of Facebook’s failed stablecoin project Libra/Diem. He is also a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Casares was formerly a partner at NXTP Ventures, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Latin America, and he is credited with introducing the firm’s founders to crypto. NXTP subsequently became a major investor in Gutierrez’s RSK as well as another Gutierrez-founded company, Koibanx, a Latin America-focused asset tokenization company that – per its CEO – is at the “forefront of redefining Latin America’s financial system.” Gutierrez’s Koibanx has been instrumental in developing Bitcoin products and services sponsored by El Salvador’s government as well as enabling the role of Algorand as an intermediary in El Salvador’s Bitcoin ecosystem. Algorand is also a major investor in Koibanx and is currently run by Staci Warden, who aided the cronyist privatization of Russia while at Harvard, oversaw J.P. Morgan’s division of emerging market government debt and led crypto-related initiatives and “global market development” for the Institute of the mastermind of the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal, Michael Milken. Gutierrez’s Koibanx has also launched a blockchain-based digital ID in Colombia with over 12 million users and is partnered with Nigeria’s government on a crypto initiative where Nigerians can exchange their intellectual property (IP) for a “stable token” considered “equivalent to the Naira,” Nigeria’s currency that has been completely taken over by the government’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. Both of those projects have also been conducted jointly with Algorand. Algorand is a member alongside PayPal and Amazon of the Digital Monetary Institute, which works with central banks, major commercial banks, and Big Tech firms to “examine the distribution and use cases of both retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies, tokenised assets, deposits and capital markets, cross-border payments and domestic interoperability.” The DMI also focuses on “crypto assets and stablecoins.” NXTP is also an investor in Ripio, an Argentina-based crypto firm partnered with the World Economic Forum. Rootstock co-founder Sergio Lerner sits on the board of Ripio’s P2P lending subsidiary, the Ripio Credit Network (RCN). Ripio is backed by Tim Draper, who is on the board of the Netanyahu family-founded crypto company Bancor, Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, and Argentina’s richest man Marcos Galperín. Galperín also sits on the board of GREEN+ partner and intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Galperín is intimately connected to the “emerging market” entrepreneurial network known as Endeavor, the board of which is chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and includes Reid Hoffman. Both the Bronfman family and Hoffman have considerable ties to sex trafficker and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein. Wences Casares was previously on Endeavor’s board and still maintains ties with the group. Ripio is also an Endeavor-backed company. Marcos Galperin at the World Economic Forum Galperín’s company, Mercado Libre, is considered the first Endeavor success story, and Galperín sits on the board of Endeavor’s Argentina branch alongside controversial Argentinian oligarchs, like former George Soros protégé Eduardo Elzstain. Galperín’s Mercado Libre is deeply interconnected with PayPal as well as Paxos, the stablecoin issuer creating PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD. Mercado Libre’s Mercado Pago subsidiary, Ripio and Brazil’s Mercado Bitcoin (another Endeavor/Mercado Libre-connected company) collectively dominate crypto use in South America, especially its biggest markets – Argentina and Brazil. Diego Gutierrez’s RSK and Wences Casares’ Xapo, a crypto-focused bank founded in 2014 with a long-standing interest in Bitcoin and stablecoin providers, share a common tie in Joey Garcia, who is on the board of both companies. Garcia is also listed as being Xapo’s Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer. Garcia is a lawyer for and head of the fintech team at the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas, which is also part of the GREEN+ group and manages the GREEN+ Trust alongside RSK and Lockton. Both Xapo and RSK’s parent, Rootstock Labs, are based in Gibraltar – a UK overseas territory, where Garcia helped develop and lobby for crypto regulations with hopes of having that regulatory regime influence coming regulations in the US and Europe. Garcia is also connected to UN initiatives on digital currencies, with a focus on regulation and law enforcement. The involvement of this network in GREEN+ speaks to an effort to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain in the creation of a new global financial system centered around digital currencies and carbon markets. As carbon markets have developed, it has become clear that the carbon market which central and commercial bankers wish to build (with UN backing) will be blockchain-based and that carbon credits will be tokenized and traded on digital exchanges, such as the Goldman Sachs and Blackstone-backed Xpansiv, which is partnered with GREEN+ members Cercarbono and EcoRegistry. There are efforts to make Bitcoin the blockchain on which these markets (or at least key parts of them) will run, hence the relatively recent effort to create a more “sustainable” and “net zero” Bitcoin. RSK is clearly part of this effort, as evidenced by their involvement in GREEN+, where they are managing the smart contracts of GREEN+ carbon credits, as well as their partnership with the California Energy Commission and GREEN+ member The Energy Coalition on creating “an experimental market for carbon credit trading” on top of Bitcoin. The importance of RSK within the maturation of the carbon credit market in the blockchain era is two-fold; the direct and immediate interoperability between tokenized assets representing green finance instruments and bitcoin, and the leveraging of the most distributed and most secure blockchain in the world, Bitcoin, as a universal ledger for the execution and settlement of otherwise impossible smart contracts. Rootstock allows Bitcoin the protocol to become the enabling and enforcing environment for all aspects of climate capitalism – green bond authoring and settlement, parametric insurance clauses, the tokenization of carbon emission offsets, and the issuance of dollar stablecoins that denominate the entire system and globalize the US Treasury market. Diego Gutierrez of RootstockLabs As recently mentioned, Diego Gutierrez of RSK was a very early adopter and promoter of Bitcoin and today runs Bitcoin Argentina while also being a co-founder of Latin America’s largest and oldest Bitcoin conference. In an interview with Argentinian outlet La Voz early last year, Gutierrez stated that, in order for Bitcoin to become part of the global financial system that is emerging, there would have to be a “trade off” that would mean stripping Bitcoin of its “ethos” and “part of its disruptive potential.” In other words, in Gutierrez’s view, Bitcoin must cease to be a threat to central and commercial banks as it integrates into the system those banks have designed and uphold and will become their tool. There is perhaps no greater evidence of this than the recent pivot of BlackRock’s Larry Fink on Bitcoin and its promise as a “technology for asset storage” and the wild success of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Gutierrez also tellingly stated in the same interview that there would soon be a move away from fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins to commodity-backed stablecoins that would make the companies and entities that control those commodities (which would include carbon in this emerging financial paradigm) more powerful than central banks and eliminate the need for central banks entirely. Wences Casares, Gutierrez's close associate, created his bank Xapo to help “solve the disjointed nature of our world economy” and to act as “the bridge between bitcoin, US dollars and stablecoins.” As a consequence, Xapo has been a key player in efforts to dollarize bitcoin and has developed close relationships with Circle (USDC), Tether (USDT) and Lightspark, whose founder David Marcus invested in Xapo while head of PayPal. Marcus also previously worked for Facebook and co-created Facebook’s Libra/Diem stablecoin project, where Casares was on the board and which was allied with Xapo. Xapo’s initial advisory board was composed of former longtime head of Citibank John Reed, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. Summers is best known for his close association with Jeffrey Epstein and his role in repealing key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act at Citi’s behest, which is widely believed to have provoked the 2008 financial crisis. While on Xapo’s board, Summers became a leading voice behind the effort to “put a price on carbon” and implement carbon taxes and carbon markets. In 2015, together with these men, Xapo claimed, they would build “the global bitcoin ecosystem.” The GREEN+ Registry Working closely with the GREEN+ Trust is the carbon credit certification standard chosen by GREEN+, Cercarbono. In addition to certifying the carbon credits produced by the program, Cercarbono also has a role in choosing which initiatives participating jurisdictions can implement with funds received and are also involved in fund custody alongside the GREEN+ Trust. Cercarbono was launched in 2016, shortly after Colombia – where Cercarbono was formed – passed a law establishing a carbon tax. Cercarbono’s founders created the company because the law created a “need for a national certifying entity that would provide solutions to the climate problem.” Further Colombian legislation in 2017 spurred the company to expand into carbon markets. It has since become a leading voluntary carbon credit certifier in Latin America. In 2018, Cercarbono formed a partnership with EcoRegistry, a blockchain registry that is also part of GREEN+ and “develops services and platforms for reporting, monitoring and registering environmental assets and carbon units.” The program says the company also “addresses the issuance, monitoring and cancellation of the carbon credits generated by the jurisdictions in close coordination with the certification standard and the Trust Fund.” EcoRegistry provides a unique serial number to each carbon credit issued and allows for close monitoring of that credit on-chain. As a consequence, it works closely with the lead of GREEN+’s monitoring unit, the intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic. EcoRegistry is also a part of the Climate Action Data Trust, or CAD Trust. The CAD Trust was discussed in previous reporting from Bitcoin Magazine and Unlimited Hangout and is an effort led by the World Bank and funded by Google (among others) in an effort to construct what they refer to as “climate wallets.” IETA, discussed below, is also a member of the CAD Trust. Tokenized, Inc. The World Bank has been exploring tokenization and digital ledger technology in order to create “a modular and interoperable end-to-end digital ecosystem for the carbon market.” Through the Digital for Climate (D4C) working group, the World Bank aims to build “the next generation of climate markets” by directing governments to create National Carbon Registries reliant on blockchain technology. The data produced by these registries will be “link[ed], aggregat[ed] and harmoniz[ed]” by the CAD Trust. D4C itself leverages the Chia blockchain, developed by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen. Part of the D4C’s “Climate Tokenization Suite” includes the aforementioned Climate Wallet to facilitate the exchange of carbon credit tokens, requiring an active connection to a Climate Action Data Trust node to function. EcoRegistry is also part of the Climate Chain Coalition, whose other members include disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann’s new venture Flowcarbon, the Cardano Foundation, the Google-backed oracle service Chainlink, and the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), which seeks to “encourage [bitcoin] miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization.” The SBP aims to turn “sustainability into an investable asset” when they create what they refer to as a Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate (SBC), a verified “on-chain environmental asset” representing “bitcoin mined using clean energy.” The SBP website further specifies the incentivized opportunity for additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners, stating that “unlike carbon credits or RECs which are retired,\" each individual SBC is a tokenized asset which “permanently represents the sustainability of one bitcoin.” Due to an upcoming 50% reduction in the rate of bitcoin issued per block – referred to as a “halving” – alternative sources of income for miners can be the difference between thriving and barely surviving in such an unforgiving market. While initially issued alongside the mining of every new bitcoin, the SBC itself can later be sold to other investors. Depending on future regulations of energy in relation to Bitcoin mining operations in the United States, non-mining businesses might look to purchase these certificates from miners as a means to offset the carbon footprint of their bitcoin holdings. In effect, the SBP aims to incentivize carbon neutrality for Bitcoin miners while simultaneously allowing investors to meet ESG goals while holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, the latter exemplified in their partnership with Bitcoin custodian BitGo. Their website explains that they “believe Bitcoin has a unique potential to expedite the clean energy transition” and due to being “the world’s first commodity derived from a network,” every bitcoin mined is “fully fungible in both price and also carbon footprint” – culminating in a “sustainability opportunity unlike any other industry.\" If a large company with a large carbon output due in large part to the sheer energy demands of being a multi-national company – traveling employees, large scale data centers, and simply offices that require electricity – was holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, they could purchase large amounts of SBCs to source yield on the appreciating certificate token while also generating accounting opportunities to reach metric-based ESG goals faster. The co-founder of SBP, Matthew Twomey, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, OSL and Deutsche Bank, while Head of Climate Strategy Elliot David previously held positions at the US Department of Energy, as well as worked with the Clinton Foundation within their Clinton Climate Initiative on their Island Energy Program. Listed among the SBP Advisors are Natasha Barrientos (S&P Global and the United Nations), Dr. Julia Nesheiwat (the Atlantic Council), Emma Todd (World Economic Forum) and Kelvin Chang (Coinbase and Microsoft). Cercarbono and EcoRegistry share several noteworthy partners and affiliations. For example, both are members of Asocarbono, an alliance of different companies and actors running or supporting Colombian carbon markets, that has written about the issue of “carbon rights” within voluntary carbon markets. According to the UN, “carbon rights” “comprises two fundamental concepts: 1) the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc. and 2) the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights (i.e. through emissions trading schemes).” The issue itself portends the possibility that those who purchase carbon credits will obtain the “property rights” of the carbon sequestered in trees and other natural elements found in the area tied to those carbon credits, opening the door to land grabs through carbon markets. Notably, there is no clear definition of carbon rights and it is unclear, due to the fact that their contracts with jurisdictions/governments are not publicly available, how GREEN+ views the issue of carbon rights in relation to property rights. Source: AirCarbon. Note: Prices on October 7, 2022. EcoRegistry and Cercarbono are also both partnered with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), “the world's first fully digital carbon exchange,” established in 2019 with the Singapore Sustainable Energy Association – subsidized by the Singapore government's Enterprise Singapore – and backed by the UN. ACX was founded by CEO Thomas McMahon, an over 30 year veteran of the commodities and derivatives industry, having spent over 20 years at the New York Mercantile Exchange before establishing himself in Singapore, where ACX is based. ACX is Singapore's first international carbon credit exchange, chosen by McMahon “due to demand for carbon credits from the airline industry.” The exchange uses distributed ledger technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, to trade six different tokenized carbon credits, boasting settlement for “as low as $3 per 1,000 CO2 tonnes.” While ACX began mainly by focusing on the airline industry, the exchange now has over 160 clients ranging from financial institutions to project developers. Between January and August 2021, over 5.7 million CO2 tonnes were traded on the exchange. Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 20% stake in the company, with the intent to build a carbon exchange in the UAE. ACX is also partnered with IETA (more on them below), as well as the Carbon Business Council, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). It can be assumed that ACX will be the exchange on which GREEN+ carbon credits will be traded due to its partnerships with GREEN+’s credit certifier and registry. Both Cercarbono and EcoRegistry were also recently integrated into Xpansiv, which “operates the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system and market data service” as well as CBL, the “largest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.” Xpansiv is backed by Blackstone, which poured $400 million into the company, with other investors including British Petroleum (BP) Ventures, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Xpansiv’s CBL has partnered extensively with CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group, which is one of the world’s main derivatives exchanges, and together they have produced several futures contracts on carbon markets. Cercarbono and EcoRegistry also both share an affiliation with the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA. Founded in 1999 under the auspices of the UN, IETA “is dedicated to the establishment of linked trading systems to ensure efficient and competitive GHG [greenhouse gas] markets.” Its inaugural members included the titans of the oil and manufacturing industries. Current members include AngloAmerican mining, Saudi Aramco, Bank of America, Bayer/Monsanto, Cargill, Chevron, Citi Group, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, PetroChina and the Mossad-linked commodities company Glencore. Another company that is a member of IETA is StoneX, which is partnered with the aforementioned exchange ACX and is sponsoring the launch of GREEN+ satellites in Miami later this month. IETA is also part of the aforementioned Climate Action Data Trust, along with EcoRegistry, the World Bank and others. IETA is also notably behind the ICROA accreditation program, which Cercarbono and most other carbon credit certification standards of note have received. These include the world’s leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was recently embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed that 90% of their most common category of carbon credits were “worthless” despite being ICROA (and IETA) approved. Satellogic Satellogic - Observation Is Preservation As the digital carbon credit industry grows into a multi-trillion dollar market upheld by smart contracts on a distributed ledger, so too does the need for participants to access metric-specific data to insure the eventual pay outs of green bonds. For example, the company Atos, best known for its Olympic Games IT partnership since 1989, raised $916 million in sustainability-linked bonds at the end of 2021. According to a press release in November 2021, the bonds were issued with “an eight-year maturity and one percent coupon,” with a clause that the annual interest rate paid during the “last three years will be unchanged if the company reduces its annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 & 3) by 50 percent in 2025 compared to 2019.” While these particular bonds were not authored using a blockchain, there remains the now-sudden economic incentive – a one percent coupon on nearly $1 billion – to deliver verifiable real world data to the participants, the state of which determines the eventual payout. These bonds were issued with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan acting as Global Coordinators and with Joint Bookrunners such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, and Wells Fargo Securities, among others, with Rothschild & Co “acting as financial advisor to Atos SE.” An article from Data Center Dynamics on the raise makes note of the common trend of “sustainability-linked financing” among data center and communication firms, referencing how NTT, Aligned, Airtrunk, KPN, Baidu, and Nabiax all raised “funds or converted existing debt to include interest rates tied to sustainability and ESG goals” within the last year. Atos and techUK When the eventual payout of billions of dollars in cleverly-authored green bonds comes down to accurate measurements of carbon molecule density over a vast land mass, such as a South American rainforest, the market for reliable data service providers has quite literally left the atmosphere. As the debt instruments of the private sector evolve alongside the proliferation of blockchain technology, the data that makes these smart contracts execute to eventually settle the issued bond no longer goes to a human arbitrator, but rather a consciousness-free protocol that reduces a pair of potential outcomes to a single output. In the case of a sustainability-linked green bond, if the carbon emissions of a business are not empirically reduced beyond a relative metric at a certain time – both data points of which are determined at the issuance of the smart contract and thus willingly agreed-upon by both parties – the coupon on the bond is not paid out. With the carbon credit market presenting itself as one of the preferred debt instruments of the modern era, the aforementioned Satellogic – an intelligence-linked company focused on privatizing the data from satellite surveillance with an advisory board full of key players in the digital debt system – finds itself ready to act as a crucial pillar of the encroaching new financial system. Emiliano Kargieman of Satellogic Satellogic was co-founded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman, its current CEO, and Gerardo Richarte, its current CTO, after spending “some time” at the NASA Ames Campus in Mountain View, CA. According to press releases on their website, Satellogic is “the first vertically integrated geospatial company” that is building “the first scalable, fully automated EO [Earth Observation] platform” with capabilities to “remap the entire planet at both high-frequency and high-resolution” in order to generate “accessible and affordable solutions for customers.” Their listed mission is “to democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images and analytics” to help solve the world’s most pressing problems” of which they list “climate change, energy supply, and food security.” Other Satellogic documentation reveals that by “democratize,\" they mean expand satellite surveillance from the public sector (i.e. governments and security agencies) into the private sector. Due to their “patented Earth imaging technology,” Satellogic “unlocks the power of EO” to deliver “high-quality, planetary insights” at “the lowest cost in the industry.” Both Kargieman and Richarte previously worked for Core Security Technologies, which Kargieman co-founded, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Homeland Security, NSA, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and DARPA. In 1998, Core Security was recognized as an \"Endeavor Entrepreneur\" by the Endeavor Foundation and in 2002, Morgan Stanley invested $1.5 million into Core Security, with the bank gaining a seat on the board. The company was also funded by Bank of America in its Series A. Kargieman later founded Aconcagua Ventures in a joint venture with Craig Cogut’s Pegasus Capital, and served as a Member of the Special Projects Group at the World Bank. As previously noted, Cogut’s Pegasus Capital is also a main funder of CC35. Another Core Security Technologies employee that migrated to Satellogic with Kargeiman and Richarte is Aviv Cohen, a former Israeli intelligence officer who is now Satellogic’s head of “special projects.” Satellogic's seed round raise was funded by Ariel Arrieta and NXTP Ventures, Starlight Ventures – which Kargieman advises – and Santiago Pinto Escalier of Endeavor. As stated earlier in this article, NXTP is a funder of GREEN+ member Rootstock as well as the tokenization firm created by Rootstock’s co-founder, Koibanx. Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns a significant stake in Elon Musk’s Tesla, invested in Satellogic’s Series A as did Endeavor Catalyst, which is run by LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman, and Valor Capital. Valor Capital, whose partners include figures tied to US military and intelligence activities in Latin America as well as CBDC development on the continent, invested in Satellogic’s Series B, again joined by Tencent, with the Inter-American Development Bank (mentioned more than once in this article) joining in the company’s Series C funding round. In July 2021, Satellogic went public with a $1.1 billion valuation through a “merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s CF Acquisition Corp. V,” with J.P. Morgan serving as the “exclusive financial advisor to Satellogic,” with a “concurrent PIPE offering of $100 million led by SoftBank’s SBLA Advisers Corp” alongside Cantor Fitzgerald and “other top-tier institutional investors,” including former US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital. Mnuchin’s recently created venture capital firm, along with Softbank, are major investors in Cybereason, a controversial company tied to Israeli intelligence that previously simulated the hacking of US critical infrastructure in order to cancel a US presidential election and spur the declaration of martial law. Mnuchin’s firm also includes Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and previously attempted to recruit former Mossad director Yossi Cohen, who instead went on to join Softbank. Joseph Dunford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump who is now senior managing director of Mnuchin’s firm, is on the advisory board of Cybereason while Mnuchin is on its board of directors. Both Mnuchin and Dunford simultaneously sit on the board of Satellogic and Mnuchin is Satellogic’s chairman. Satellogic Board of Directors Satellogic’s board also includes Howard Lutnick, longtime head of Cantor Fitzgerald (as well as Jeffrey Epstein’s neighbor and a major Clinton donor); Marcos Galperin, the founder and CEO of MercadoLibre who is closely associated with Endeavor, a Satellogic funder; Former Facebook and Twitter lawyer turned venture capitalist Ted Wang; Tom Killalea, former Chief Information Security Officer and Vice President of Security for Amazon who is also on the board of Capital One; and Miguel Gutiérrez, a Partner and a Co‐Chief Investment Officer at The Rohatyn Group. Gutiérrez previously worked with Nicholas Rohatyn at J.P. Morgan, where Rohatyn positioned the bank to become a leader in taking ownership of distressed government debt in the 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on Latin America. Gutiérrez was involved with J.P. Morgan’s debt markets in Argentina, before becoming its head of Latin America Emerging Markets and later head of Global Emerging Market Sales. The press release about Satellogic’s SPAC paints a clear picture of the hefty value proposition behind the public offering, which boasts that Satellogic is the “proven leader in Earth Observation” with “17 commercial satellites” currently in orbit, more than “the next four Earth Observation companies combined.” The satellite company's vertical product stack offers “enhanced analytics capabilities” with “commercial, sustainability, and government applications” by providing a “live catalog” daily of “every square meter of Earth,” providing “vital information to power the conversation around global challenges” such as “climate change, water and energy use, and food supply.” In the SPAC press release, Cantor’s Howard Lutnick stated that “Satellogic is uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry. Its technology, data, and analytics have vast use cases across countless industries.” Kargieman echoed these remarks: “We think this is a winner takes most or winner takes all market. This is a supply limited market – governments just can’t get enough data today; there’s not enough satellites out there.” This is also true for the private sector. Satellogic showed CNBC a then-current investor deck which exemplified the true economic potential of dominating “the Earth Observation industry.” Kargieman noted that the company had completed “a pilot program” with “a major oil and gas corporation,” in which the company required surveillance data for “about 1,800 miles of pipeline every other week.” Doing this visual audit with airplanes “cost about $750 per mile,” whereas Satellogic “demonstrated similar detection capabilities” for less than $60 per mile. While Satellogic failed to clear $0 of revenue in 2020, the company was expecting to see that “tick up” due to new contracts that began generating revenue in the spring of 2021. According to an investor slide deck, the company had a backlog of about $38 million in signed contracts around when they went public, but was predicting “$800 million in opportunities over the next two years.” In their full year 2022 financial results update, Satellogic CEO Kargieman tallied “34 satellites in orbit” making “the largest commercial fleet of sub-meter resolution satellites” and thus “well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Earth Observation data and satellites.” Kargieman claimed their revenue grew “42% year-over-year” due in large part to their “Asset Monitoring” and “Constellation-as-a-Service” businesses. Satellogic's new Space Systems, or satellite sales business, “creates a satellite purchase program that aims to lower the financial barrier to Earth Observation spacecraft ownership” according to CFO Rick Dunn. “Space Systems is designed to offer governments asset ownership to enhance national geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) with global tasking autonomy... Going forward, revenue will be driven by our continued growth in Asset Monitoring.” Luciano Giesso, Sales Director for Satellogic has stated that Latin America is “an area of focus for us.” He explained a current trend of Latin America being “increasingly focused on space technologies” in order to “create new infrastructures” that “unlock the benefits of satellite data” throughout multiple industries. The press release states Satellogic's position is informed by their view that “countries unequipped with their own satellites” are thus “limited in their ability” to meaningfully “capture data about their policy implementation and infrastructure.” Satellogic’s Dedicated Satellite Constellation Program is specifically marketed as a product for “strategic national interests” allowing “governments of all sizes” to create “unique earth-observation programs” to “support key decisions and manage policy impact, measure investment and socio-economic progress, and foster collaboration, data and information sharing, and innovation.” The stated mission of Satellogic is to privatize and monopolize Earth Observation in the form of satellite surveillance sold as a service to both the public and private sectors. Palantir, a private sector intelligence firm led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and created with CIA funds to replace a controversial DARPA mass surveillance and data-mining program, committed to a five year strategic partnership wth Satellogic. Satellogic's partnership with Palantir enables its “government and commercial customers”, which include the CIA and J.P. Morgan, access to Satellogic’s Aleph platform APIs to feed raw satellite imagery to Palantir’s MetaConstellation and Edge AI. This partnership builds on a previous collaboration between Satellogic and Palantir to “field unique AI capabilities to the orbital edge,” including “live upgrades to the satellite’s onboard AI” that enables “an ultra-low-latency maritime use-case.” Palantir and Satellogic customers, which include the Pentagon's Space Systems Command, Space Force, SpaceX, the government of India, and others, will soon have access to the Edge AI platform running on Satellogic satellites “to offer customers tailored AI insights” which is expected to increase Satellogic’s business of “data products, streamline pipeline management, and further scale customer delivery required for weekly and daily world remaps.” Palantir “The holistic capabilities of Palantir’s Foundry will be instrumental in helping Satellogic realize our mission to improve life on Earth through geospatial data,” commented Matthew Tirman, President of Satellogic North America. Tirman later made note that within this agreement, Satellogic will provide “Palantir’s US government customers” with access to “high-resolution satellite imagery” which will “drive analytical insights across a range of mission-oriented use cases.” Other notable private-public sector partnerships of Satellogic include the Endeavor-funded SkyLoom, which in late 2021 partnered with Honeywell to “produce laser crosslinks” for both commercial and military satellites, including for the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency, as well as with CIA contractor Amazon Web Services, to facilitate the “50 gigabytes of data per day” per satellite, which “beams to Earth with the help of the Amazon.com Inc. unit’s AWS Ground Station service.” While it is surely a profitable venture, what Satellogic truly enables is venture capital access to high resolution data of every single square meter on Earth. Space surveillance as a service allows the operators themselves to fill up on up-to-date information of the world's industry, energy use, transportation, commodity storage, and asset consumption – information that could influence a firm's decision while playing in the private markets. It could also be used by the public-private partnership engineering global technocratic policies that seek to limit consumption, industrialization and energy use by the public and enforce them via space. Outside of this metric-driven advantage, the aforementioned transition to a universal ledger upholding and settling the majority of financial (including purely speculative) activity will require obscene amounts of data. If the private sector's so-called commodity-backed, Real World Asset tokens are to take off in any meaningful way, highly reliable satellite imagery will be needed to uphold billions of dollars of value. Any push towards smart contract-derived money representing tangible objects will demand exactly the data Satellogic intends to not only supply but sell as a service – to any firm, or government. Blockchain - The New Enabling Environment The idea of green finance, in which private firms utilize data and physical elements from the real world to create novel economic instruments such as bonds based on carbon emissions, necessitates government-upheld agreements and eventual court-based litigation as the ability to find consensus, thus acting as the enabling environment, for the settlement of large values of securities between the public and private sector. Regulation and contractual agreements between governments and their commercial sector partners require not just the literal letter of the law, but vetted insurance brokers, data firms, legislative bureaucrats, and various other accredited lawyers to dictate the grounds in which business can be legally conducted. The private-public partnership has become continually blurred by the relaxing of regulation restricting how corporations can influence current and aspiring politicians via campaign fundraising. In turn, this group of purchased public sector employees must repay the corporations responsible for their successful attempts at gaining office, leading to the push for further dissolution of certain laws that prevented their donors from gaining footholds within a once-regulated market. No longer is the public sector primarily beholden to their constituents, but rather their corporate donors. This ongoing dynamic has led to a runaway feedback of legal corruption and conspiracy between these ostensibly delineated sectors. The net result of the public-private partnerships that upholds the CC35, Green+ and Satellogic collaborations is due to the calculated focus on regional governments, thus finding their enabling environment through pacts and treaties at the subnational level. Steve Mnuchin Once larger regulatory “fish are fried,” the fight for further interoperability of digital assets (such as dollar instruments) moves down to the regional governments of the Global South. For example, the regulation allowing US banks to custody digital assets and stablecoins was put forth by former OneWest official and Coinbase VP Brian Brooks while he served as comptroller of the currency under Mnuchin in the Trump administration. Once world governments, local and national, are forced onboard the universal ledger, the enabling environment will trend towards the ledger itself – a product of the private sector – and further out of the hands of the public sector. This capturing of the commons by the private sector via a revolving door of public-then-private operators has been done before, such as during the Plaza Accord, the creation of Brady Bonds, the dissolution of Glass-Steagall, the demolition of Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 fiscal response. The intended future of blockchain – now that US regulators have embraced Bitcoin as an asset and universal ledger – is to serve as the new enabling environment, complete with its very own digital dollar instruments, most likely backed by US government debt. There are very few people in the world more responsible for the digitization of the dollar than Steve Mnuchin and Howie Lutnick – the former's VC firm now consists of several members from his stint at the Treasury, while the latter's firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds the securities for Tether, the world's largest dollar-denominated stablecoin that recently crossed $100 billion issued – and here they are partnering with the richest man in Argentina and the founder of the largest online marketplace (as well as crypto marketplace) in Latin America, Marcos Galperin. The network of firms associated with Galperin's MercadoLibre – Xapo, Paxos, Circle, Visa, among others – is rife with board members and venture capital from the “PayPal Mafia,” as well as the Argentine advisor group Endeavor. These powerful organizations, successors to groups like ADELA that spurred the creation of the Club of Rome and chose the winners of Latin America’s corporate landscape, have made it clear that they foresee this fundamental market transition. They have quietly positioned themselves to dominate the main pillars of the new financial system in Latin America and the world at large: regulated banking services, global marketplaces, payment processing, digital asset infrastructure, and capital creation monopolies. As we will see, this financial system is not about “inclusion” or “sustainability” as professed, but about using and deepening Latin America’s debt burden to force policy changes while enforcing foreign control over the region’s economic activity and governance, all under the watchful “eyes” of US intelligence-linked satellites.

JUST IN: $1.5 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton says Ordinals drive ‘positive momentum’ in #Bitcoin innovation. Institutions are coming 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3lSDwNwE5Q — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 4, 2024 In recent years, Franklin Templeton has emerged as one of the earliest big institutional adopters of Bitcoin. After filing for a spot BTC ETF last year, the firm launched its Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) in January amid a wave of SEC approvals. This openness to Bitcoin continued in a recent report from Franklin Templeton's Digital Assets division in which it highlighted the rise of Bitcoin-based NFTs called Ordinals, new fungible tokens, and layer 2 protocols. Franklin Templeton tweeted that these new projects primarily drive positive momentum in Bitcoin innovation. Trading volume data shows ordinals like NodeMonkes and Runestone surpassing Ethereum NFTs. According to the report, this is providing evidence that Bitcoin provides advantages over other blockchains, and that its security, decentralization, and large user base give it an edge for mainstream adoption. Beyond NFTs, technical standards like BRC-20 and Runes are expanding Bitcoin's functionality. Along with layer 2 scaling, these developments are kickstarting a new growth and maturity phase, the Wall Street firm said. Franklin Templeton's bullish perspective reflects a broader institutional warming towards Bitcoin and its capabilities, with major players like BlackRock also embracing Bitcoin even as they openly discuss \"tokenizing\" assets.",

    "article_summary": "Halving hype and ETF inflows have left Bitcoin miners with all-time profit margins. Firms are accumulating money in a mad dash, and reinvesting it to prepare for the imminent halving.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. With Bitcoin’s next halving set to take place this month, miners are using record profits to adapt their business models for chaotic opportunities. The halving is almost upon us. As the whole world of Bitcoin waits with bated breath for mining rewards to be cut in half, the potential for new revenue streams has left us wondering how the space will react to new market conditions. Halvings in the past have generally been associated with prosperity for Bitcoin, but they’ve also been known to shake up previously-held assumptions in a big way. We’re already seeing a few examples of these market changes; just to name one, the larger miners have been modernizing their equipment to ensure maximally efficient hardware. This has led to a fire sale of outdated equipment from these companies, with many thousands of mining rigs finding their way to aspiring miners in Africa and Latin America. The cheap hydroelectricity from Ethiopia has already been attracting international capital to become a new mining hub, and a large portion of these rigs are going there for pennies on the dollar. In other words, miners are expecting to see less output in the immediate future, but this has nevertheless incentivized the creation of new mining companies worldwide and net growth for the industry. This is just one illustration of the sorts of unexpected opportunities that will take the digital asset space by storm, and it’s up to Bitcoiners to seize on them. For miners as a whole, opportunities are certainly plentiful. March 2024 saw the highest ever monthly revenues for the collective mining industry, just topping $2 billion. This is particularly noteworthy because less than half of this revenue has come from transaction fees, a far cry from the situation in December where transaction fees outpaced mining rewards. In December, the price of Bitcoin was far lower, and the blockchain was plagued with congestion. Not only did this congestion suppress the demand for buying Bitcoin, but it also raised the demand for miners to process the blockchain. Simply resolving transactions on already-mined Bitcoin made up a larger share of profits than mining and selling new ones, and this enterprise became a lifeline for many smaller firms. Now, however, it seems like the money is flowing all around. Bitcoin ETFs are gobbling up Bitcoin at extreme rates—more than 6x the actual output of miners. The bonanza has even brought venture capital interest squarely back into focus, further increasing the frenzy. In the first three months of 2024, major exchanges collectively saw their reserves of Bitcoin drop by nearly $10 billion, revealing the immense demand for newly-mined coins. With market conditions like this, it’s no wonder that miner profits have hit an all-time record. Source However, although this period of intense sales has certainly created an opportunity for the miners, there are also perils associated with the halving. These companies are in a mad dash to secure as much revenue as possible pre-halving, and the race is so desperate for one simple reason: trendlines may give encouraging data, but there’s no actual guarantee that Bitcoin’s price will climb accordingly after its supply is cut down. Halving hype and the runaway success of ETFs have brought Bitcoin’s price to its highest levels, but this record has been followed by volatility. Bitcoin has hovered around its great benchmark ever since passing it without continuing to rally in a bombastic spike. If Bitcoin’s price continues to behave in unexpected ways, it will eventually wreak havoc on smaller firms and promote industry consolidation. Additionally, a particularly interesting development has emerged in the secondary Bitcoin markets. Since the rapacious demand of ETF issuers and other financial institutions has completely outpaced supply, some long-term holders (LTHs) have been awakening to fears of a generalized liquidity crisis. Whales previously content to hold Bitcoin for years at a time have changed their behavior, evidently deciding that now is the time to finally realize massive profits. March 2024 has seen long-term holders begin selling their assets at unprecedented rates, raking in a disproportionate amount of profit in relation to other Bitcoin sellers. Obviously, a resource like this cannot last forever, but it’s an important reminder to some of the miners: just because you’re having trouble making ends meet post-halving, it doesn’t mean the industry is. Adapt, or the space will find new ways to leave you behind. Source Nevertheless, miners big and small have not taken on the challenge of the halving lying down. These runaway profits have enabled businesses to invest in a wide variety of preparation strategies, sometimes even dramatically shaking up their business models. For example, the American firm Arkon Energy has previously operated more as an infrastructure company, viewing itself as a provider for a client base of independent miners. As it announced a major purchase of state-of-the-art mining equipment on April 2nd, it joined an industry-wide trend of preparing for the halving with maximally efficient machines. Rather than offering this equipment to its previous clientele, however, Arkon has stated its intention to pivot and simply mine Bitcoin themselves. This simple shift represents a dramatic change in their overall business model, and they plan to follow through by “aiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world”. Leading miner Hut 8, on the other hand, has initiated a business model pivot of its own, but in a slightly different direction. A Q1 earnings call in late March saw CEO Asher Genoot acknowledge that 70% of the company’s revenue came from asset mining, but that plans were expected to change somewhat as the halving approaches. Hut 8 is still focusing on upgrading its hardware and exploiting energy resources at new sites, like many other mining companies, but it’s also investing in a new direction. This new direction is not in a different asset, as its mining operations are focused on Bitcoin, but rather in developing high-performance computing and AI operations. Genoot claimed that these new operations were “sub-scale today… But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow.\" He added that “You’ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine,” stressing the need to maintain an eager and disciplined attitude toward the existing mining operations. These are just a couple of the different new strategies that miners are taking to anticipate the halving. Companies have been preparing for months now, and there is still time to make additional new plans. At the time of writing, the halving is in less than three weeks, and the countdown to this event reveals the optimistic and celebratory attitude of Bitcoiners everywhere. No matter what happens when the long-awaited day finally gets here, a few constants seem very reliable. There will be an immense demand for the world’s leading digital asset, and the Bitcoin community will have the same innovative spirit as always. Whether Bitcoin jumps right away or behaves unpredictably, it’s certain that someone will wind up a big winner. For us Bitcoiners, that means there’s plenty to look forward to.",

    "article_summary": "The global bitcoin mining company will harness wind and solar energy from West Texas to expand its operations.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Today, one of the largest bitcoin mining companies in the world in terms of hash rate, Genesis Digital Assets (GDA), announced that it will gain access to 36 MW of power from the Tarbush data center in West Texas, adding 1 EH/s to its total hash rate capacity. GDA, which was founded in 2013 and operates 19 mining facilities across North America, Europe and Central Asia, has entered into a strategic hosting arrangement with Lonestar Dream, developer of immersion cooling systems for bitcoin mining devices, to run the Tarbush operation. “This hosting agreement is an important milestone for us as we continue expansion in the West Texas region,” said Andrey Kim, CEO of GDA in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. This is the 6th new site in Texas into which GDA has expanded in recent years. The state’s abundance of renewable energy and its flexible power grid have prompted the company to continue expanding in Texas. Tarbush is located within the ERCOT West Hub, which is well-suited for wind and solar energy production. As of Q1 2023, ERCOT, which stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, was the top region for renewable energy generation output across the US, according to S&P Global. And PBS recently acknowledged that Texas, a state once well known for its oil production, is quickly becoming a leader in renewable energy. According to ERCOT, renewable resources like wind and solar normally meet approximately 40% of the energy demand in Texas. During some periods, though, they can meet as much as 75% of the demand. Wind, solar, and a tiny bit of hydro met 75% of power demand in ERCOT today a little after 2:00, a new record. Add in nuclear and the Texas grid was more than 80% emissions-free for most of the afternoon. And again, prices were $0. Clean power is low cost power. #txlege #txenergy pic.twitter.com/rtbPBWnZMA — Doug Lewin (@douglewinenergy) March 29, 2024 “We believe that our commitment to renewable energy and utilization of some of the most advanced technology in the bitcoin mining industry empowers us to engage in efficient and reliable bitcoin mining operations,” Kim added.

    "article_summary": "Spot bitcoin ETFs saw record trading volume of $111 billion in March, nearly triple February's total, indicating strong demand for the new products.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their trading volume surge to a record $111 billion in March, nearly triple the $42 billion traded in February. Approved earlier this year by the SEC, US spot bitcoin ETFs have rapidly gained traction among investors. Their volumes last month exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. NEW: #Bitcoin ETFs saw a record volume of $111 BILLION in March. That's TRIPLE the inflows from February 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Ol1PaS8vC9 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 3, 2024 According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, March trading volume was around triple that of February and January. The massive rise indicates spot bitcoin ETFs are meeting strong demand from institutional and retail investors. He stated, \"I can't imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.\" BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack, capturing 50% of the total volume. Grayscale's GBTC took second place with 20%, while Fidelity's FBTC followed at 17%. Balchunas declared IBIT the \"$GLD of bitcoin,\" referring to the mammoth SPDR Gold ETF. He said its March victory makes IBIT the undisputed leader among bitcoin ETFs. The surge in trading activity aligns with Bitcoin's climb to new all-time highs in March. However, it also suggests spot ETFs are altering market dynamics and driving new demand. Critics initially argued bitcoin markets would shrug off the new products. Yet flows into funds like IBIT and FBTC have been overwhelmingly positive. Demand is vastly outpacing bitcoin mined. ETFs bought around 66,000 BTC in March, while miners only produced 28,500. This supply-demand imbalance seems poised to grow as more investors get exposure through ETFs and newly mined coins get cut in half in two weeks during the bitcoin halving event. With strong inflows, assets under management, and trading activity, these new regulated instruments have firmly established themselves within Bitcoin markets. If March was any indication, their rise is only just beginning.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Today, the US government sent a transaction that appears to indicate it may be on the verge of liquidating the remaining Bitcoin it confiscated from the online marketplace Silk Road. According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds. Arkham Intelligence first identified the origins of where the BTC was coming from, and the coins destination of Coinbase. It appears the purpose of this transaction is to sell the coins, as it has previously done in the past. Last March, the U.S. government sold off 10,000 bitcoin related to Silk Road, selling just over 9,861 BTC worth $216 million, according to a court filing. As in this case, this event was proceeded by 3 on-chain transactions, which were sent a few weeks prior to the sale's disclosure in a court filing. The U.S. Marshals Service is one of the largest Bitcoin sellers to date. According to data from researcher Jameson Lopp, the US Marshals have helped the US government sell 195,000 BTC. Despite attempts by U.S. lawmakers to have the agency hold these funds as a strategic asset, it has continued to sell the funds in line with its mandate, the role of the U.S. Marshalls Service being to sell off assets confiscated in criminal investigations.",

    "article_summary": "Bitcoin Magazine sits down with NoOnes CEO Ray Youssef to discuss why peer-to-peer bitcoin trading is essential for the liberation of the Global South.",
    "article_detailed_content": "I recently spoke with Ray Youssef, CEO of NoOnes, a peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin trading platform with numerous other functionalities, about how NoOnes is empowering its users, what it's doing in response to the Nigerian government’s crackdown on Binance P2P and why P2P marketplaces play a crucial role in fulfilling the promise of bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they’re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: What is the primary mission of NoOnes? Ray Youssef: It's the world's first peer-to-peer distributed nation. I see myself as a chief advocate, not just CEO — someone that is representing the people. We want to onboard a billion citizens in the next six years. By citizens, I mean engaged customers. They're not just using it once every two weeks. They have to be deeply engaged for this to be victorious. That means a billion daily engaged people. It's an amazing number when you consider Binance has 120 million users and about 2-3% of them are probably monthly active. We're trying to get a hundred times that. Corva: How many people are currently using it? Youssef: We have about 400,000 active users, which is pretty amazing. My old company had like a quarter million active [users]. The goal here is not just to get empty signups. The goal here is to make people active. Corva: You’ve talked about how apps like NoOnes and Bitcoin can help end “financial apartheid.” Could you define this term? Youssef: Financial apartheid is the most evil form of apartheid. It's invisible chains that have basically kept the vast majority of the world poor for over a hundred years, and people aren't even aware [of it]. It manifests in so many different ways. Broken overregulation [is one form of it]. Africa is the most overregulated region of the world. M-Pesa is the top mobile wallet in Kenya. 98.8% of Kenyans have an M-Pesa wallet. M-Pesa is so big it’s expanded beyond Kenya to Ghana, South African and other African countries, but you still can't send money from an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya to an M-Pesa wallet in Ghana or South Africa. You are trapped in the economy where your passport was issued. You can't access liquidity in other countries, and they can't access liquidity in your country. The problem gets even worse when you consider commerce between companies. Pan-European trade is at 69%. In Asia, I think it’s 59%. Latin America drops down to 30%. And Africa, officially it's at 13%. But guess what? The real number is less than 1%. Because in that 13%, they count all these American and Western corporations that just have local names. Intracontinental African trade is at less than 1%. If that doesn't scream financial apartheid, what does? Corva: Speaking of Africa, let's discuss what's happening in Nigeria. The government took two Binance executives hostage. In response, Binance has stopped supporting the Naira and has shut down its P2P trading platform in Nigeria. NoOnes is currently enabling Binance P2P traders to transfer their P2P trading profiles from Binance to NoOnes. How is this going? Youssef: Traders are very happy to have their feedback imported over. It's very important. Reputation is huge in this business, especially if you're an OTC trader. [So,] we made a special landing page for all the peer-to-peer refugees. They're very happy to come over and be able to talk to the CEO directly in a Telegram and WhatsApp channel. That goes a long way. Binance is being torn apart by the US government right now. Why did they go for this guy (Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance’s former CEO) so hard? Were they angry he was front-running his own users? No. They didn't care about that at all. What they really cared about is that CZ and Binance allowed all of us plebs — all of us peasants out there — to have financial access through peer-to-peer trading. The fact that there's 120 million people on the same internal money transmission network and that CZ has all these off ramps to local money all over the world set them off. Remember the guy they came after before CZ? Ross. Corva: Ross Ulbricht? Youssef: Yes, sir. Peer-to-peer is the enemy, and it always has been. They've had Ross in jail for over 11 years. He just put up a website like Amazon or eBay where anyone could trade anyone with anything. [Sure,] some people sold some weed on there. For that, they made up this story about [his involvement in a murder conspiracy]. This is all garbage. This is a sweet, innocent kid. And they put him in jail for two life sentences. Corva: And Sam Bankman-Fried only got 25 years. Youssef: The only reason Sam Bankman-Fried got any time at all was because some rich people lost some money. This is the only reason that Madoff got any time at all. too. If he was robbing poor people, no one would give a damn. But Ross Ulbricht, man, they hit him with everything because they could. They wanted to send a message: “Hey, if you try to make global free marketplaces — real commerce — happen, we're going to destroy you. You don’t touch that.” And guess what? They’ve done that to bitcoin, [too]. They said, “Hey, we’ll let bitcoin exist as a store of value. If you get in good with us, we’re going to give you an ETF ticker. We’re going to get our pension funds in there. We’re going to let the price go up high. You’ll be just a little bit better off than everyone else. But you gotta give up this whole medium of exchange [thing].” We gave up literally the best thing in the world, a free system of real commerce for a store of value for just another get rich quick pump and dump. It’s actually beginning to dawn on all of us: Oh, my goodness. Roger Ver was right. Corva: I was actually just watching an interview with him on The Bitcoin Takeover. He made some interesting points that are in line with what you’re saying. Youssef: I mean, yeah, I was pissing all over Roger with all the other clowns before, too, but the dude is right. We have lost the ethos. We have lost the foundational base for what we're doing. And should they actually manage to keep bitcoin out of the picture as this medium of exchange and just keep it as a store of value, eventually we'll lose everything. If it wasn't for what's happening in the Global South, it's empty. And quite frankly, the Global South has moved over mostly to USDT on Tron. The only nation still [using] bitcoin primarily for a medium exchange is Nigeria. But the truth is, USDT on Tron is way cheaper. It doesn't have volatility. It makes a lot more sense. So, how are we going to compete with that? Corva: That’s a good question. Going back to Nigeria for a moment. NoOnes has team members on the ground who are promoting the platform in the wake of Binance P2P shutting down. Do you ever worry about their safety? How do you deal with the fact that they could easily be targeted? Youssef: Number one, I’d try to get them out of the country. And if we can't do that, then I’d ask them to keep as low of a profile as possible. We also keep something in the bank to represent them legally. I don't want anyone to go to jail for anything I do. I'm not going to play with other people's freedom or safety. But throughout this whole process, everyone's been pooping all over the Nigerian government. They're like, “These people are dumb,” and that's not helpful. There are some very smart people in the Nigerian government that know exactly what's going on, but they can't tell their own people exactly what's going on because their own people wouldn't be able to handle it or help them. Every time I talk about this on Bloomberg or CNN Africa, I say, “The governments are not the problem. There is external pressure being applied to them that we're not aware of.” And this is always the case in every one of these situations, whether it's Zimbabwe or Venezuela. I invite the government to talk anytime. Peer-to-peer is not a problem but the solution to actually correcting Nigeria's capital control imbalance. If you go to peer-to-peer traders and say, “We need you to help us get more American dollars into the government here to stabilize the price of the Naira, they're like, 'Okay, [let’s] do it for Nigeria.'” [However,] they're not going to lose money doing it. They want to make some money doing it. But if they have the choice between doing the right thing to help everyone across a long-term timeline and making a little bit less profit, they'll take that. Believe me, these people are not stupid. They know what's good for the country is good for them, and that should be leveraged. Corva: Speaking of people not being stupid, the team at NoOnes focuses heavily on education. How challenging is educating people on the ground? Youssef: I posted a video on my Twitter of one of our workshops. There were over a thousand people there. That's how much hunger there is for this. Seriously, Education is THE way and #noOnes is absolutely blowing up now !#Bitcoin to the first billion, self custody and p2p. pic.twitter.com/lEGaNlXGSE — Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) March 27, 2024 Everyone needs bullish education. What I mean by bullish education is not the one, two, threes, or even how the blockchain works. No one really cares. It's how to make money. People want to change their lives. You can move money around the world to leverage arbitrage. You can start real simple and put up an offer to buy bitcoin cheap on NoOnes and then take it and sell it on another exchange, a local exchange, whether you're in South Africa or Malawi or wherever at 10% plus. That's what some people are doing. One guy I just talked to last week was making $2,000 a month — just buying bitcoin cheaply and selling it for 9-10% of what he bought it for. He [told me], “This is how I’m paying my way through college.” He spends just five hours a week doing these trades. There's another dude in South Africa, and he identified a problem. Nigerian workers want to send money back home to mama. They can't do it because they don't have a South African bank account. So he tells them, “Deposit your cash into my South African bank account.” He just takes that cash, buys bitcoin with it, sells that Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria on the NoOnes marketplace and says, “Send a bank transfer to this guy’s mother’s bank account.” He did two peer-to-peer transactions and turned [South African] Rand into a Nigerian bank transfer, and the people on the ground are super happy they didn't have to do it themselves. They just put money in the bank, gave him his mom's bank account number. He did all the work. He's banking and making profit. He started his own remittance corridor. He's basically Western Union for the very specific corridor of South Africa to Nigeria. Corva: These are incredible stories. When I think about NoOnes, I think about people around the world gaining access to bitcoin, not necessarily becoming entrepreneurs using the platform. It’s great to hear that P2P bitcoin trading enables this. Youssef: Absolutely. We are in the middle right now of the peer-to-peer revolution. It started with the internet. We got all these mobile devices and all these startups that disrupted everything except finance. Then, we got peer-to-peer electronic cash. Now, we're fighting for the soul of it as a [medium] of exchange. Peer-to-peer marketplaces are the last step. That's what they put Ross Ulbricht in jail for. That's what they put CZ in cuffs for. They don't want someone actually finishing it, completing the peer-to-peer revolution. We're going to the mom and pops, the farmers markets, but if the money isn't peer-to-peer, none of it will stick. Once we’ve gone peer-to-peer, what power do they have? Humanity is officially one once we tie that ribbon around the peer-to-peer revolution.",

    "article_summary": "Robin Linus has recently released a proposal for BitVM 2, offering significant improvements from the original BitVM proposal.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Last October Robin Linus from Zerosync dropped a bit of a bomb in the form of BitVM. One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained. You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that’s it. You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions. Robin’s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing could be enforced in Bitcoin script: a NAND gate, one of the basic primitives of computing at the physical/electrical level. Every computation that is possible can be constructed out of NAND gates. Script can actually verify a NAND gate due to a neat trick using OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT. OP_BOOLAND is an AND operation, the opposite of NAND. OP_NOT takes a binary 1 or 0 value and inverts it. This together allows you to actually enforce a single NAND operation in script directly. In combination with hashlocks, a NAND gate script can be made where each input and output field has two possible hashlocks to “unlock” that spending path, each one pushing a 1 or 0 to the stack to perform the NAND operation. Each script also has a path where if you can reveal both preimages to a single bit value, you can immediately claim the funds. This is so that once someone decides what to input to the NAND gate, they cannot change their mind without losing money. A massive amount of NAND gate scripts can all be compacted into a taproot tree, and once someone commits to the bit values off-chain to input to that computation, the other party can challenge them on any individual step in the computation to prove it is being executed correctly on chain. Each “challenge” allows the challenged party to prove that the individual gate was computed correctly, otherwise the other party can claim the funds after a timelock. Going back and forth like this if a computation is contested, it is guaranteed that the cheating party will eventually be caught and lose funds. The limitations The main limitation of BitVM is that only the people involved in creating a BitVM contract can participate, and the roles are very limited. There is the prover, the person asserting how the computation happened off-chain, and the verifier, the person who can challenge the computation and force it to be proven on-chain if the prover does not complete the computation off-chain or tries to lie about the results. One of the reasons for designing BitVM was to establish two way pegs to sidechains or other systems. The scheme offers a very powerful primitive in that use case, the ability to actually enforce funds be given to one party or the other based on the correctness of an arbitrary computation, i.e. a validity check on whether a pegout is valid according to a sidechains rules. The problem is, only the people who hold keys to that BitVM UTXO can actually go “Hey, you’re cheating!” when someone is, and engage in the challenge protocol. This ultimately makes the system still trusted. Another limitation is that the challenge response protocol can be very long. If someone realizes the outcome of the computation is going to result in them losing money and they stop responding, the verifier has to essentially guess where the individual NAND gate is in the computation that the prover would have to lie at and reveal both preimages to a bit that would give the verifier the funds. Until that specific gate is challenged on-chain, the prover can still respond correctly to a challenge and drag it out. This can be very time consuming and inefficient. Some improvements to this design have been made since the original proposal to allow for multiple verifiers to exist in the system with the prover, to create a 1-of-n trust model where only a single verifier is required to challenge a dishonest prover. However, this requires the instantiation of multiple BitVM instances in parallel to accomplish, and therefore increases the inefficiencies with the original two party design. BitVM 2 Robin recently proposed a design scheme for BitVM 2. This scheme seeks to make a few trade offs in comparison to the original design for the benefit of mitigating its two major shortcomings. BitVM 2 shortens the challenge/response protocol length from an indeterminate series of transactions that could be upwards of dozens in the worst case scenario, to two rounds in the challenge/response. In addition to this, with the use of connector outputs it allows anyone to act as a verifier. It does not require someone to be a member involved in establishing the BitVM to challenge a dishonest prover. The fundamental shift here is moving away from directly using script NAND gates to implement the raw computational trace directly, and moving to using them to implement a general SNARK zero knowledge proof verifier (one of the core primitives Robin intended from the start to implement using BitVM). Instead of putting the raw input into the raw computational trace, and running it gate by gate in their own tapleaf scripts, the input of the BitVM 2 instance would simply be a zero knowledge proof input in combination with an asserted output of the computation. In addition to abstracting away the computation implementation with a ZKP, the tapleaf scripts are being massively expanded from a single NAND gate per leaf to an entire sub-function of the ZKP verifier. Instead of the challenge response protocol being based around the verifier guessing at which NAND gate the prover attempted to cheat at, selectively challenging at a single gate, the verifier can prove an entire sub-function’s output is invalid according to the input. Just like BitVM 1, the contract is pre-negotiated using pre-signed transactions and branching scripts. Funds pegged into the BitVM are sent to an n-of-n multisig which signs two possible execution transactions, one in which no challenge occurs, and one in which a challenge occurs. To start the process of executing the contract, the prover initiates a kick off transaction. This kick off transaction commits to the output value ‘y’ they claim the computation produces, and includes three outputs: a timelocked output that is included in the no challenge execution transaction, a connector output A, and a connector output B, both of which also are spent in the no challenge transaction. Here is where the design allows for anyone to participate as a verifier. Connector output A has a second pre-signed transaction that can spend it, the challenge transaction. This is a pre-signed transaction that pays the prover a bond in bitcoin, but the connector output A is not enough to fund it. Literally anyone can add their own inputs to fund the transaction and spend connector output A, which invalidates the no challenge withdrawal transaction for the prover (one of the inputs it needs no challenge exists). This forces the challenge path. Connector output B is also spendable using a pre-signed transaction, the assert transaction, to the output of every sub-function in the entire BitVM 2 contract. This requires a large transaction with a lot of data, but remember, the ultimate output ‘y’ the prover is claiming the computation produced was already committed to in the kick off transaction. This creates two outputs. One is a timelocked output, the other is a connector output C. Both of these outputs, in addition to the original pegged in funds, are all spent in the second successful withdrawal transaction for the prover after the timelock. Connector output C is also spendable by anyone who can prove that any sub-function output in the BitVM 2 contract produces an invalid output. This requires a very large transaction, because the script necessary to prove an entire section of the BitVM computation is incorrect is massive, but in this single transaction a verifier can claim the coins in the connector output with a valid proof. This invalidates the second withdrawal transaction for the prover and effectively burns the coins. The only way to recover them at this point is if the prover and all of the verifiers in the original n-of-n funding multisig all cooperate to recover them (in the case of a setup ceremony involving key deletion this recovery possibility does not exist). Connector output B in the kick off transaction can also be spent after a much longer timeout than no challenge withdrawal to invalidate both the no challenge and the assert transaction, burning the pegged coins. This reduces what could be a ridiculous chain of transactions in the original BitVM proposal to enforce the correct contract outcome, to at most four transactions (although admittedly very massive ones), while in the process making the set of verifiers for the BitVM 2 instance literally anyone with bitcoin who will fund the challenge transaction. BitVM 2 could wind up being a significant breakthrough in regards to the wave of rollups and other layer 2s aiming to use BitVM as a two way peg. The operator of a rollup (the prover in the BitVM) can use their own funds to cover withdrawals of users who have pegged into the system, and periodically withdraw those funds from the BitVM to compensate themselves. Any user or interested party would then be able to penalize them by burning their funds if they could produce proof the operator was not processing all withdrawals correctly. It is important to note that ultimately the security of a BitVM 2 instance is backstopped by the n-of-n keyholder, even though people not participating in it can still challenge the prover as a verifier. But because the prover has an efficient exit in the case of no challengers, and anyone can fund the challenge transaction to act as a verifier, the n-of-n funding multisig could follow a setup and key deletion ceremony similar to the Zcash launch to improve its security. BitVM 2 will probably wind up being a significant breakthrough in terms of improving the flexibility and trust model of two way pegs that make use of BitVM. Once again, Robin has proven himself a real wizard.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC, a leading player in Bitcoin mining infrastructure, has placed a significant order with Bitmain Development Pte. Ltd. for 27,700 new-generation Bitcoin mining machines, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This purchase includes 14,200 T21 machines and 13,500 S21 machines, with deliveries slated to commence in June 2024. “We are very excited to announce the purchase order of 6 EH/s worth of new generation Antminer S21s and T21s from Bitmain,” said Founder and Chairman, Josh Payne. “This transaction marks a turning point for Arkon, as we become a vertically integrated operator of both Hosting and Self Mining infrastructure across our portfolio of data centers in Texas and Ohio.” Arkon, traditionally a hosting provider for Bitcoin mining customers, is pivoting towards self-mining operations with this purchase. The new machines boast an aggregate portfolio efficiency of less than 19 joules per terahash (J/TH), positioning Arkon to become one of the most efficient players in the Bitcoin mining sector post the upcoming halving event in April. Currently operating with 117MW of approved capacity across two data centers in Ohio, Arkon has plans for significant expansion. They have binding agreements in place to develop additional sites in the United States, potentially boosting their operating capacity to 307MW, subject to successful funding and site development. “Arkon has spent the last two years consolidating the distressed market for data center assets in some of the lowest-cost power markets in North America,” Payne continued. “Now we are taking the next step to vertically integrate the business with a purchase of a fleet of new generation miners, aiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world.” The news follows Arkon's announcement last week to list on Euronext Amsterdam through a business combination with BM3EAC Corp.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin mining businesses generated their highest-ever monthly revenue in March, raking in over $2 billion in block rewards and transaction fees. This shatters the previous record of $1.74 billion set back in May 2021. JUST IN: #Bitcoin Miners hit a record $2 billion in monthly revenue, highest ever. Halving coming in hot in 2 weeks 🙌 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 2, 2024 Of the $2 billion earned last month, around $85 million came from transaction fees, while $1.93 billion was from the block subsidy. (Miners receive compensation both for validating transactions and minting new bitcoins.) The block subsidy, paid out for each block mined, is currently 6.25 bitcoins. But it will drop to 3.125 bitcoins after the upcoming halving event in April. This will cut miner revenue from new bitcoin creation in half unless there is a significant price rise. Higher network activity and increasing bitcoin prices both contributed to miners' bumper revenues in March. The upcoming halving created urgency for miners to maximize earnings before profits are squeezed. The leading US mining pool, Foundry, captured 29.4% of all blocks mined in March. Chinese pool AntPool took second place with 22.4% of blocks. The two captured over half the monthly Bitcoin supply. While miners enjoyed their profit bonanza last month, exchange-traded funds purchasing bitcoins on the open market accumulated even more. ETFs bought roughly 66,000 bitcoins in March, while miners only produced around 25,500. This widening supply-demand imbalance and halving-related scarcity could spur greater competition to secure Bitcoin. The resulting difficulty increases may start pricing out less efficient miners, spurring industry consolidation. With the halving cutting rewards in half in a matter of weeks, miners face an increasingly harsh environment if Bitcoin's price fails to compensate for the drop in issuance. But if history repeats, a strong bitcoin bull run could still be on the horizon, softening the revenue blow of reduced block subsidies.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million. This latest purchase was revealed through on-chain data rather than an official announcement. Tether has not publicly disclosed its Bitcoin addresses. However, transactions tracked on the blockchain show 8,888 BTC were recently sent from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to an undisclosed Tether wallet. The recipient address now holds over 75,000 BTC worth $5.3 billion. In May 2023, Tether first revealed it was allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, with plans to invest up to 15% of quarterly profits. \"The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\" Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, said in the statement when they announced their Bitcoin strategy. While unconfirmed, analysts believe the identified wallet likely belongs to Tether. The amount perfectly matches its pledged buying strategy and claimed holdings in its latest financial reports. Tether has emerged as a major player in Bitcoin markets and its accumulation race. The company is now estimated to be the seventh largest holder of BTC. Its steady purchases, combined with those of institutional investors like MicroStrategy, tighten supply. Critics have raised concerns about Tether's lack of transparency and the potential market risks of its growing bitcoin stash. However, its embrace of Bitcoin also shows the asset's broadening mainstream acceptance. Tether aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's growth while diversifying its reserves away from traditional assets like government debt. Tether is one of the world's largest holders of U.S. Treasuries. This latest $600 million acquisition is unlikely to be Tether's last. As the stablecoin leader continues executing its Bitcoin investment strategy, its influence over Bitcoin markets is only set to increase.",

Irene Gao, VP of Mining at Bitmain, highlighted in her announcement how the Antminer S21 Pro has a hash rate of 234 TH/s and an energy efficiency ratio of 15.0 J/TH. In contrast, the Antminer S21 has a hash rate of 200 TH/s and a power consumption efficiency ratio of 17.5 J/TH. Gao also highlighted how durable the S21 Pro is. \"It has the ability to deal with more challenging environments,\" she said, before sharing that the device can withstand temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). The after coupon U.S. dollar to terahash rate for the device is $18.9/TH and Bitmain will begin shipping the device in Q3 2024. This announcement comes just seven months after Bitmain launched the S21. The S21 was quickly adopted by Bitcoin miners, as it has already sold out via the company's website. Bitmain no longer has Antminer S21 mining devices in stock. \"We truly believe this new product will be helpful for you to make your long-term plans for your mining expansion, especially before the new cycle,\" added Gao. For more information on the Antminer S21 Pro, keep an eye out for updates on Bitmain's website.",

    "article_summary": "Binance's withdrawal from Nigeria leaves room for African built companies to serve the African market.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Some Nigerians were shocked when crypto exchange Binance announced they would discontinue all services in Nigeria by March 8. Despite facing scrutiny from regulators before the announcement, many people still asked how the biggest exchange in crypto could just disappear from the world’s fastest growing market for Bitcoin adoption. I wasn’t shocked because I’ve been predicting this for years. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are under attack and the frontline is a currency war being played out right before our eyes. I founded NoOnes, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform based in the Global South, because I foresaw the problems facing the crypto industry. Three years ago, I saw this day coming. I knew it was coming because I was the CEO of a Bitcoin company based in the United States, and I saw the financial apartheid and all the regulatory problems up close. American regulators hold Africans in such low regard they make rules to suit Westerners and don’t care too much about anyone else. I knew it would be more and more difficult to serve Africans and the rest of the Global South if my company was based in the US. That’s why I created NoOnes. My only option was to turn my back on a business I had built into a Bitcoin P2P platform with over 10 million users. The problems I saw back then are exploding right now, but blaming governments alone is not the path forward. We must understand the pressures our leaders are under because only when we do that can we come to the table with them to forge a new path ahead. Right now, all we have is a bunch of people cursing each other and that is not the way forward. This war is about the financial system and the power to control the levers that decide whose money is good and whose money is bad. Entrepreneurs in the Global South are trapped in their own markets, so that even making payments or doing business with countries next door is difficult. For the average African entrepreneur to scale any business by expanding outside the African continent, it is basically impossible. And now that Binance has left Nigeria, some businesses based here are wondering what’s next. To be able to truly unlock the potential for Global South entrepreneurs to create value, we have to nurture them and create an environment that allows them to flourish. That’s only possible if we do what I’ve been advocating for years: ensure there is free trade by having a free-flowing money system. Making it happen is not going to be easy, and that’s why I had to make some tough decisions. I had to leave the US, I had to give up a successful company I founded, and I had to start all over again in the Global South. I know why Binance was forced to leave Nigeria, and I’m sure it will happen to other crypto companies and in other countries. It’s almost impossible to run a crypto business or a bitcoin marketplace serving Africa from another continent because you have to be on the ground to see the problems and find the solutions. I knew we couldn’t achieve our mission to help the unbanked if we didn’t have boots on the ground in the Global South, and that’s why we based NoOnes here right from the start. I’m not some mad guy who gave eight years of my life to a company and then left on a whim. I set-up NoOnes so I could be here for this moment. Binance might have pulled-up stakes and gone home, but NoOnes won’t do that – we are already home. I know Nigeria and I know the Global South because my businesses have been active here for years. We live and work here now, and we listen to what people on the ground tell us. We hired local Africans to handle moderation for Africans, for example, and that’s partly what “boots on the ground” means – instead of a bunch of Americans passing judgment, we use local Africans to make moderation safer and fairer. We are not looking at Africa – or any of the Global South where we operate – as places to plunder. We see Africans as partners and fellow humans. That’s why we created our partner program to share our profits with the people who are part of our business. I’ve met thousands of tech-savvy Nigerian entrepreneurs and I know there is a reason for the high-level of Bitcoin adoption here. For too long they have been shackled by an unfair global financial system, by financial apartheid that creates money prisons and stifles economic growth. Bitcoin and NoOnes give those entrepreneurs the opportunity to show what they can do when markets are free and money is allowed to flow. All they need to grow is a level playing field. They just need a shot, a path towards success, and when we open up any window of opportunity they bust right through it. That’s why NoOnes is not simply creating the best site to buy Bitcoin. We are going all out to give them life-changing opportunities. When I speak in auditoriums around Africa and explain what is possible with Bitcoin and our peer-to-peer platform, I see people’s eyes light up. When I talk to them one-on-one, I am astonished at the amount of hustle and business acumen they have. Our next step is to make it easier for these entrepreneurs to take their business to the next level. We are building a product that will give local entrepreneurs a massive opportunity to build businesses in their own country for their own citizens, and, ultimately, to keep the profits inside their country. Despite the withdrawal of Binance Nigeria, tons of opportunities remain. NoOnes was built for these times and we are ready to pick-up the slack to help dynamic, savvy Nigerians who see the value of Bitcoin and want to be a part of this new era of prosperity in the Global South. The battles we have to fight might be tough, but the opportunities on the fastest growing continent on the planet are worth it. This is a guest post by Ray Youssef.

    "article_detailed_content": "A U.K. judge ordered to freeze $7.6 million (£6 million ) worth of Craig Wright's assets worldwide after finding that he falsely claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin. The order comes after Wright's decisive loss in a landmark lawsuit against the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA). Earlier in March, Judge James Mellor ruled that Wright did not author the Bitcoin whitepaper, create Bitcoin, or develop its early software, debunking his longstanding claims to the contrary. Now, Mellor has granted COPA's application for a worldwide freezing injunction to prevent Wright from dissipating assets and evading costs related to the case. The British judge found Wright's recent transfer of shares to an overseas company \"gave rise to serious concerns\" about his intentions to avoid the impending costs order. Judge Mellor quotes from the freezing order judgment: “that necessarily means (as I shall explain in my Trial judgment) that Dr Wright has forged documents on a grand scale and, during his cross-examination, he lied extensively and repeatedly.” “Dr Wright has shown himself… pic.twitter.com/BBIlIuZNG6 — hodlonaut 80 IQ 13%er 🌮⚡🔑 🐝 (@hodlonaut) March 28, 2024 Wright must now disclose all assets exceeding $30,000 in value and is prohibited from reducing his holdings below $7.6 million. The freeze reflects ongoing doubts about Wright's trustworthiness, given his history of defaulting on court judgments and boasts about being \"judgment proof.\" The new freezing injunction further hampers Wright's ability to pursue additional Satoshi Nakamoto-related litigation. It also ensures assets will remain available to cover the multi-million dollar costs bill COPA expects to recover after debunking Wright's outlandish assertions. The British judge's actions to freeze Wright's assets appear justified in light of his dishonest behaviour. The saga underscores the need for courts to wield tools that prevent litigants like Wright from abusing the legal system and evading accountability.",

    "article_summary": "Security is priority #1 when it comes to keeping your bitcoin safe. A simple guide on how to keep your seed phrase private and secure. The fourth installment of “10 Steps to Self-Sovereignty” powered by Ledger.",
    "article_detailed_content": "When it comes to self custodying your bitcoin, there is one inescapable fact: the buck stops with you. You are responsible for your own funds, you are responsible for keeping them safe, you are responsible for everything. This can be a daunting prospect, but there are ways to approach self-custody simply. Securing your Bitcoin can be thought of similarly to building a house. First, you have to lay a foundation, then you build a frame on top of that, from there you fill in the walls, insulation, utilities, etc. For each piece of the house you want to add, you need to have completed the previous piece properly or the entire house will be unsafe and unstable. When it comes to Bitcoin security, your seed phrase is the foundation of your security. It is simultaneously the most important yet potentially weakest point in security. Just like the foundation of a house impacts its stability, your seed phrase impacts your wallet’s security. So how do you store a seed phrase securely? Here are some core considerations to take into account when figuring out how to secure your seed phrase. Sharing Is Bad Your seed phrase is your money. Every private key needed to authorize spending, every address and every Bitcoin account in your wallet: all of these pieces are generated from your seed phrase. Anyone who has access to your seed phrase has access to any funds stored in that wallet. Thus, creating and securing a backup of this seed phrase is imperative. If something happens to your hardware wallet, or the device you installed your software wallet on, your only hope is your seed phrase backup. If you lose that seed phrase backup your money is gone. Your money is accessible in two ways when self custodying your funds, either the wallet you are using, or your seed phrase backup. Your bitcoin wallet protects a copy of your keys on that device, but it can’t help you protect the seed phrase backup. No one should be given access to your seed phrase; as cold and callous as it sounds, you can’t be sure they will handle it responsibly. They can still misplace a copy of your seed phrase, or leave it lying around unsecured, without any malicious intent on their part. So, rule one: never share your seed phrase with anyone. Any exception to this rule under any circumstances should be thought through long and hard before breaking it. After all, being too trusting could put your Bitcoin at risk. Computers Are Not Your Friend It is critically important to avoid recording your seed phrase in any digital format. Computers are incredibly complicated machines and thus are prone to a litany of security issues. People’s devices are hacked on a regular basis. Copies of your seed phrase can be put at risk when stored digitally. In short, your laptop or smartphone is vulnerable to malware and spyware. If a hacker gains access to your device, they may be able to read your files and extract your seed phrase from any type of digital storage they can access. For this reason, you should avoid storing your seed phrase digitally. This goes especially for storing anything in a remote digital service, like a cloud storage provider. If your email account was ever compromised, the hacker could use your credentials to log in to any cloud storage service and access your seed phrase. Under no circumstances should you ever: Store your seed phrase on a cloud storage site such as iCloud or Google Drive Take pictures of it with your phone or other digital camera Send it over any digital medium, such as email or text message Enter it into anything but the bitcoin wallet you are using Handle it in front of any camera Say it out loud near a microphone The only copy of your seed phrase should be physical, and completely isolated from the internet. This is why keeping sizable amounts of Bitcoin in a software wallet on your computer or mobile phone is not recommended either. To put it simply, your internet connected devices are vulnerable to hackers. Thus, if you want to keep your Bitcoin safe, you should invest in a hardware wallet. Use Durable Seed Phrase Backups One important decision should jump out at you when it comes to making a backup of your seed phrase: what do you write it on? This may seem like a silly question if you’re new to this space, but unless you stop using Bitcoin you will need to secure your seed phrase for the rest of your life. Durability is incredibly important. You could just write your seed phrase on a piece of paper and stuff it in a drawer, but how long will that stay safe? Paper is flammable: it degrades. If you spill water on it the ink could bleed and your backup could become unreadable. Paper is not suitable for longer-term storage. Metal is a much better option, and numerous products on the market are designed to store your seed phrase on metal.. Some solutions use tiny individual metal tiles with letters on them, so you can slide them into a frame and lock them in place to record your words, such as the BillFodl. Metal tile backups are reusable, so over time if you generate and move to new wallets the same backup kit can be reused for the new seed phrase. It’s also possible to “destroy” your backup easily if needed by removing the tiles. If you move somewhere you can’t take your backups with you because of the risk of someone else finding them, for example going through an airport, you might not want to leave your backup intact. Other metal backups use etching tools to scratch or impress the words directly into a flat metal surface, providing even stronger protection against threats like fire. This is extremely secure, but destroying a copy of your seed phrase etched into metal is extremely difficult. To really be certain it is destroyed you have to grind down the entire face of the metal plate until no trace of the words are left. Lastly, there are capsule based solutions. These use little steel tiles with letters on them, but instead of sliding them into a flat frame, they are loaded into a steel tube around a rod to hold them in place. This can give the benefits of reusability while ensuring that any fire warping does not scatter and dislodge the letter tiles. When picking between metal tiles or steel plates, weigh the pros and cons of both carefully. But remember: use something metal. Don’t trust your Bitcoin to a flimsy piece of paper. Physical Safety Now that we’ve established how to store your seed phrase, where should you store it? Keeping the seed phrase on a robust piece of material is important, but so is keeping it in a place that is difficult to access physically. It should be stored somewhere you can keep locked, such as a safe or a lockbox. A safe is better than a lockbox, as that is bulkier and harder to physically carry. A safe attached to a wall is even better yet, requiring the destruction of a wall to remove the safe. If you don’t have a safe or a lockbox, keep your seed phrase out of sight. Put it in a filing cabinet or desk drawer in a room not accessible to other people. The important part is making sure that wherever it is, no one else can access it. Splitting Your Backup You might not have a single place that can be safely secured to house your backup seed phrase. Two options exist that can allow you to maintain a safe backup without keeping your seed phrase in a single location. If you are considering splitting your seed phrase backup, follow a well known protocol or don’t do it at all. Splitting your backup yourself Seed XOR is one mechanism. It is a process that allows you to take a pre-existing seed phrase and split it using a mathematical process into two (or more) new seed phrases. These new seed phrases are fully valid and can later be recombined to regenerate the original seed phrase they were created from. This allows you to divide your seed phrase into pieces and store it in multiple locations. It is very important to keep in mind though, you must have 100% of the split seed phrases, if you lose a single one you cannot regenerate the original seed phrase. A big benefit of XORing is you can do it by hand. Shamir’s Secret Sharing The second is Shamir Secret Sharing. Similarly to seed XORing SSS breaks your seed phrase into multiple pieces, but it uses a very different mathematical process to do so. Unlike seed XORing, Shamir shares allow you to recover your original seed phrase with less than 100% of the shares. It can be set up like a multisig, i.e. as long as you have 3-of-5 backup shares you can regenerate your seed phrase. The only downside is that only certain wallets support using Shamir, and it cannot be done by hand. Under no circumstances should you split up your seed phrase manually. If you are not following a safe and widely scrutinized protocol like Seed XOR or Shamir Secret Sharing, don’t even consider it. Naively splitting your seed phrase into multiple pieces can drastically reduce the security of your bitcoin. Guessing 12 or 24 words randomly and happening to guess someone’s seed phrase is statistically impossible, but if someone has 4 of those words? Or 6 of those words? It starts actually becoming practical to guess the rest of your seed phrase. Another alternative, if you use a Ledger, is the Ledger Recover service. This paid optional service uses a variant of shamir’s secret sharing called Pedersen Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS). This allows you to backup access your wallet without a seed phrase after going through an identity verification process with your government ID. Social Recovery If you are in a situation where you do not have a secure place to store your seed phrase backups, alternative solutions exist. Wallets and services such as Unchained, Casa, and Nunchuck Wallet offer multisig solutions where a third party can hold one of your keys for you. For instance if you have a 2-of-3 multisig, they can hold one key. This ensures that as long as you don’t lose both of the keys you keep yourself, they can assist you in moving your funds to a new wallet. Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe At the end of the day securing your bitcoin is your responsibility. It is something you need to take seriously and put in the proper effort to maintain, no one is going to come and save you if you don’t take it seriously. As Gandalf warned Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings, “Keep it secret, keep it safe.” That is your job as a Bitcoiner, to keep your seed phrase hidden from other people and safe from those who would wish to take it from you. The simple advice in this article is the vast majority of what you need to do to accomplish that. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel. Just record your seed phrase on a durable medium like metal, and keep it physically safe from prying eyes and thieving hands. Keep it locked in your safe or a room other people do not frequently access. Check on it from time to time. That’s all you have to do. Don’t over complicate things in your head, just keep it simple and your bitcoin will be safe.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Metalpha Technology Holding Limited (NASDAQ: MATH) provides qualified investors and institutions with boutique crypto wealth management services, as a rising star in Asia akin to MicroStrategy (MSTR). CEO Adrian Wang founded the company on a mission to build a sustainable crypto ecosystem with effective hedging solutions in an industry known for its boom and bust cycles. With the right application of derivative products, investors can ‘earn higher and lose less’ when the market is in turmoil. “The crypto industry continues to have room for growth, despite its challenges this year. We are looking very closely at how to build a stronger and healthier global market for digital assets, which we are doing together with our partners, such as Antalpha, and many others.” - Adrian Wang, Founder and CEO The company changed its name from Dragon Victory International Limited (NASDAQ: LYL) and is backed up by Antalpha Technologies Limited, the world’s leading blockchain financial services. In the past year, Metalpha not only built a stronger trading, research, and compliance team in-house but also sealed numerous partnerships such as Litecoin Foundation, NextGen Digital Venture, GRVT, ParaX, and many more. As a Nasdaq-listed company, Metalpha holds Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (asset management) licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LSQ Capital Limited, by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC). The emphasis on compliance paid off when the SFC granted an uplift on the Type 4 license. Metalpha and LSQ Capital have been actively working with the SFC on the Type 4 license uplift. With the uplifted Type 4 license, in addition to offering securities advising services, LSQ Capital is now able to issue analyses and reports on virtual assets to qualified investors. Advantages in Trading As a leader in crypto derivatives, Metalpha offers clients customized products, such as Accumulator and Snowball, that are based on mathematical models with careful financial engineering. The trading team comes with rich experience with Wall Street banks. The company reported the notional amount of derivative products issued of $382 million under its wealth management business arm, which generated a fiscal-year income of $5.7 million jumped from $0.1 million in the fiscal year 2022, a 5,600% increase. The company’s trading positions have always been targeted to be market-neutral. The company has set out strict risk limits on its positions and strictly abides by the regulation requirements in the region it operates. Bullish on Bitcoin “The surging of Bitcoin’s price indicates a strong demand from global investors as they are encouraged by the recent performance of Bitcoin ETF inflows. We believe the halving event later this year could further push Bitcoin price to a new height.” - Adrian Wang, Founder and CEO Metalpha prides itself on being the long-term advocate of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The company has been vocal about its belief in the future mass adoption of Bitcoin since the approval of the Bitcoin ETFs. The company considers itself to be a growth-driven crypto stock and is comparable to MicroStrategy in many ways. Both Metalpha and MicroStrategy focus on Bitcoin investing, whereas Metalpha focuses particularly on the wealth management sector. Since the successful restructuring, Metalpha’s stock has led a strong performance, rising more than 86% year on year as of March 3, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. Metalpha vs. MicroStrategy \"Working with the brilliant team at NextGen has been delightful. The launch of the NextGen Fund marked the first step by both sides to roll out compliant yet rewarding products together. We look forward to building a more robust partnership going forward.”Adrian Wang, Founder and CEO While Metalpha shares many similarities with MicroStrategy, key differences remain in the business model, service locations, and products. Metalpha’s revenue is highly growth-focused in a bull market as Bitcoin’s price increases, resulting in balance sheet expansion and trading revenue increases. In a bull market, a more active user base generally results in a higher subscription rate. Therefore the company’s revenue and scale experience high growth in a bull market. While MicroStrategy is headquartered in the U.S., Metalpha is based in Hong Kong. Recent Web3 policies promoted by the Hong Kong regulators have proven effective and forward-looking. It is reasonable to anticipate the digital assets industry will also bloom in 2024 as Hong Kong fully embraces Bitcoin ETFs, STO/RWA, and other milestone innovations. On the product level, Metalpha offers bespoke hedging solutions and derivative products to qualified investors and institutions. Compared to MicroStrategy, Metalpha’s business model is expansive, covering not only Bitcoin and Ethereum but also other mainstream cryptos upon request. The company offers a fully customized investing and trading experience to its customers. The company aims to offer a wide range of institutional-focused products as well. Metalpha launched Next Generation Fund I, in partnership with NextGen Digital Venture Limited. According to Bloomberg, The $100 million target fund invests directly in Grayscale's investment products and indirectly through structured derivatives in respect of Grayscale's investment products, giving institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals a compliant channel to gain indirect exposure to crypto. Despite all the differences, Metalpha considers itself Asia’s MicroStrategy in the spirit of the crypto revolution and Bitcoin mass adoption. This is a guest post by Yiwei Wang.

    "article_detailed_content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison by a judge in New York for orchestrating an $8 billion theft from FTX customers. 🚨 BREAKING: JUDGE SENTENCES SAM BANKMAN-FRIED TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON FOR MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR FTX FRAUD pic.twitter.com/M9HotmBma2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 28, 2024 The sentencing, handed down by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, comes after Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven fraud and conspiracy counts related to FTX's collapse in 2022. Judge Kaplan rejected Bankman-Fried's claims that customers did not lose money and accused him of lying during the trial. During the sentencing hearing, Bankman-Fried tried to express regret for the losses suffered by FTX customers, saying he's \"sorry about what happened.\" However, Judge Kaplan emphasized the severity of the crime, stating that FTX customers lost $8 billion, equity investors lost $1.7 billion, and lenders to Bankman-Fried's hedge fund lost $1.3 billion. The judge also criticized Bankman-Fried's dishonesty during the trial, particularly regarding his knowledge of the misappropriation of customer funds. Federal prosecutors had sought a much longer sentence, highlighting the scale and impact of the financial fraud. Bankman-Fried's rapid rise in the cryptocurrency industry, came crashing down as the extensive embezzlement scheme of FTX was uncovered, in which his fraudulent actions led to significant losses for investors and customers. Many believe this 25 year sentence is injustice, as Judge Kaplan said today before the official ruling, \"I have limited my findings on obstruction to support the finding - there may be more. The total offense level is 60 - once you cross 43, it cannot go higher. The guideline is life in prison. But the maximum is 1320 months in this case.\" Renowed whistle blower and cybersecurity expert Edward Snowden commented on the news, stating \"holy shit he gave him less than Chelsea Manning (35 years) for a waaaaay worse crime.\" The FTX founder was also the Democrat party's second-biggest individual donor in the 2021/2022 election cycle (donating over $39,800,000).",

    "article_summary": "When the money is broken, everything around it starts breaking too.",
    "article_detailed_content": "In December, I had the privilege of attending the Africa Bitcoin Conference (ABC) in Accra, Ghana. As a public health professor with a background in health education and community health, this may seem like an odd conference to attend, but this trip was pivotal for me as it brought me to my father’s birth country for the first time and connected me to the beauty and resilience of Ghanaians, their fight for freedom, and cemented my ideas that money is a public health issue. While in Ghana, I met incredibly bright people from engineers to grassroots community educators from various parts of the continent and the world, including a few fellow Canadians. I also had the chance to meet with one of my uncles for the first time, and we walked around Kwame Nkrumah square on a perfectly sunny and hot day. We toured the park where Nkrumah’s Mausoleum was, and my uncle proudly walked around with me, looking at each landmark and memorabilia, and we learned about Kwame Nkrumah’s life and political reign as the President of Ghana. I was able to revisit Nkrumah’s story which led Ghana to independence in 1957, a day celebrated by Ghanaians and many Africans, as this day represented hope and true freedom. A few days later, I toured the University of Ghana, Legon campus, a gorgeous and intellectually vibrant campus. Among other places, I walked into the campus bookstore and was instantly attracted to books on topics of decentralized government and central banking, specifically books by Kwamena Ahwoi and Ivor Ageman-Duah. This led me to reflect on some of the discussions at ABC about issues related to the centralization of money. These issues made me realize that centralized money, specifically fiat money, which is imposed on many citizens across the world by governmental decree, is harmful to public health because it is marred by debt, corruption, colonial control structures, and lack of transparent rules. How many millions of African lives could have been saved, wars avoided, workers, and businesses freed from economic shackles if money was not built upon debt? Public health is ultimately about what we, as individuals in society, choose to do to protect ourselves, families, and our communities. If we continue to repeat our past actions, we carry on to build public health interventions on a flawed socioeconomic foundation and treating symptoms of a broken monetary system. Thus, I have come to the conclusion that we need to explore the merits of new money like bitcoin so it can form a more robust base layer of society. What is Money? Money is supposed to be a medium of exchange, unit of an account, and a store of value [1]. However, our money today is far from a store of value. Nowadays, people must earn their money twice: first, work to earn a paycheck, and secondly, figuring out a way to invest a portion in assets or financial products because their dollars lose value due to inflation and currency debasement. This situation impacts everyday peoples’ ability to keep up with the cost of their home and thus negatively impacts their lives and health in devastating ways. It also causes prices of food and energy to rise [2]. Studies show that debt and financial stress is associated with various adverse health outcomes such as depression, suicide ideation, obesity, and cardiovascular disease [3, 4]. Around the world these health issues are at epidemic levels. Historically, the economy of fiat money and debt has been overlooked by previous research [5]. In many countries, money is centrally controlled, printed out of thin air by authorities, and serviced by debt contributing to crisis situations. Also, the rules of how money is created and circulated is opaque to the everyday individual. This hurts working-class people who save in money that depreciates over time. Therefore, there is a need for money that cannot be debased by central authorities so people can preserve the fruits of their labor. Money, like bitcoin, could encourage more low-time preference behaviors where people could truly save and work less thereby reducing stress and negative mental health problems associated with financial worries of the future. Bitcoin is public software code that allows for an open peer-to-peer system of money that anyone can join and is ruled by rules and not rulers. More specifically, it is a new monetary network that is deflationary and counter to the prevailing inflationary system of fiat money that operates around the world. If you haven’t already, I invite you to re-visit Bitcoin and ask yourself why you may be dismissing it. Bitcoin is not “crypto” and is not the cause of the scams on fraudulent exchanges like FTX. To learn about money creation and the ills that it spawns in society, I encourage you to read books like: The Fiat Standard by Saifedean Ammous. Bitcoin is Better by Daniel Hershberger. The Hidden Cost of Money by Seb Bunney. The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth, Fiat Ruins Everything, by Jimmy Song, and Broken Money by Lyn Alden. Debt-based money is a public health issue, and we must start recognizing it as such. The Health Impact Pyramid and The Base Layer In 2010, Dr. Thomas Frieden, an American infectious disease doctor and public health physician published “A Framework for Public Health Action: The Health Impact Pyramid,” a theory that is widely used in health promotion today [6]. In it, the five-layered pyramid reveals a hierarchy of public health and health interventions. At the base layer are socioeconomic factors that are foundational to making the greatest population impact. Frieden goes on to say that “interventions focusing on the lower levels of the pyramid tend to be more effective because they reach broader segments of society and require less individual effort.” Given the importance of socioeconomic factors, I believe that public health and health care professionals should intervene to improve this base layer of population health by examining the underlying health of fiat money and advocating for better money. If fiat money is indeed broken it cannot adequately support public health intervention. “Income” or “living wages” are frequently advocated for; however, these factors are downstream from money. Effectively, if we keep advocating for secondary factors to change when the base layer of money is broken, it is like a doctor treating the symptoms of a disease without first addressing the root cause. Public Health Advocacy Almost 100 years ago, before Frieden’s work, the Canadian Public Health Association (CPHA) was established as a sovereign voice in the nation with connections to the international community [7]. Around the world, similar organizations exist, like the American Public Health Association, Africa Healthcare Federation, European Public Health Association, Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, Public Health Association of Australia, and Public Health Association of New Zealand to name a few. These organizations play an active role in shaping policy and public discourse in the field of public health and health care. For example, CPHA plays a major role in advocacy for bringing awareness to issues that warrant national attention. Over the past seven years, CPHA has called attention to several issues including naming mental health, climate change, and even racism a public health issue. Increasingly, issues related to the social determinants like anti-racism have received a lot of attention both nationally and locally given its associations with colonialism and inequality. This and increased national recognition of inequality in Canada has contributed to the renaming of prominent places in the country like Ryerson University, which is now known as Toronto Metropolitan University and most recently there were talks led by Toronto’s City Council to rename Young-Dundas Square to Sankofa Square [8]. As a Ghanaian Caribbean Canadian, this really strikes me as a superficial way to address social inequality in Canada. Sankofa is a term that derives from the Akan Tribe of Ghana that is depicted by a bird that is looking back with an egg that signifies the future, saying “Always remember the past for therein lies the future, if forgotten we are destined to repeat it.” [9] Renaming historical and prominent places in the city may be appropriate should there be enough community-backing; however, if it fails to address the root dysfunction at the base layer, debt-based money. If we are to reflect upon history, cowrie shells were once used as money in West Africa. Eventually, European traders infiltrated the system and debased the cowrie shells which reduced their economic value [10]. While the European traders disturbed the local economies, we need to look at the larger issue that regardless of race, man’s heart is never satisfied and is lured to want more. This same trait is existent in our current centralized monetary systems in Canada and around the world. We need money that cannot be debased by another human being. The Future of Public Health and Money As public health professionals, it is crucial for us to dig into the issues we stand behind and understand the role that money itself plays in the social determinants that impact health. Currently, in Canada, universal basic income is a hot topic, and intense research and debate is underway to propose a national framework [11]. Such proposals by past presidential candidates in the United States and elsewhere have also brought this up to address inequities. Election years are currently upon us, now in the United States and in 2025 in Canada and public health and healthcare professionals should have an active voice in protecting decentralized money, i.e., bitcoin, so the free market can choose the best money for society. Public health and health care professionals should consider the following three major points: Learn about the history of money: Read books, watch, and listen to podcasts that explore the evolution and innovations of money and how centralized fiat money can lead to poor outcomes for society. Some notable podcasts include Natalie Brunell’s “Hard Money” show; Preston Pysh’s “Bitcoin Fundamentals”; Robert Breedlove, “What is Money?”; Peter McCormack’s “What Bitcoin Did”; and videos by Luke Broyles and BTC Sessions (Ben Perrin). Also, consider joining your local Bitcoin meetup group to learn more about Bitcoin with people in your community or consider volunteering with nonprofits like Bitcoin is Better that aims to introduce Bitcoin as sound money to the working class. Naming Debt-Money as a Public Health Issue: As we enter election years now in countries such as the United States and Canada, public health and health care professionals should consider raising their voices to name debt-money as a health issue. The detrimental effects of a centralized financial system on the socioeconomic status of individuals, which directly impacts health outcomes, should be explored, acknowledged, and addressed. Promoting Public Discourse on Bitcoin: Public discourse should include conversations around what policies are needed to protect all citizens’ access to a decentralized system like Bitcoin. More specifically, we should openly examine what health outcomes and social equity would look like if there was a global economy that drew its economic energy from a base of only 21,000,000 divisible units.

    "article_detailed_content": "In a significant move, Google has begun indexing Bitcoin blockchain data into its search engine results. Users can now search for Bitcoin addresses and see transaction details directly in Google searches. NEW: Google has recently started indexing #Bitcoin data into their search engine 👀 Huge Development 👏 pic.twitter.com/hIAJfLkYXh — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 28, 2024 This integration comes after years of Google's rocky relationship with Bitcoin. The tech giant banned Bitcoin-related ads in 2018 before reversing course in January 2024 and allowing Bitcoin ETF ads after their approval earlier this year. The policy change signaled Google's warming stance. Now, displaying Bitcoin data in search results greatly expands public access to on-chain activity. With Google processing over 3.5 billion searches daily, basic Bitcoin blockchain data is now conveniently available alongside standard web results. Currently, Google is allowing three address formats - P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32. When searching any of these Bitcoin public addresses, users will see the current balance, its last update and the balance as of the last transaction. The move is significant given Google's vast global user base. Mainstream Bitcoin adoption depends partly on accessible tools for exploring and understanding the Bitcoin blockchain, and Google search democratizes this capability to some extent. However, while Google is taking steps toward mainstream adoption, privacy-focused Bitcoin advocates have raised concerns. As Wasabi Wallet commented on X, \"Now think about what it means for Google to be indexing all of Bitcoin transaction activity. Google has so much extra data they can link to your stack.\" Since the Bitcoin blockchain is public, Google displaying balances and transactions does not reveal any non-public information. But it does centralize and surface data that was previously more obscure. This has worried Bitcoiners who prefer to minimize exposure and maintain privacy. Nonetheless, Many Bitcoiners are applauding Google for the incremental integration. By surfacing primary data alongside standard results, Google has opened the door to broader on-chain literacy. If adoption continues growing, more comprehensive indexing may be close behind.",

JUST IN: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says their spot #Bitcoin ETF \"is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs.\" 🚀 pic.twitter.com/J6g7XrYWCU — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 27, 2024 \"I'm very bullish on the long term viability of Bitcoin,\" Fink stated. \"That surprised me how much that's gone up. We are creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I'm pleasantly surprised and I would have never predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand.\" Fink's bullish stance on Bitcoin's long-term prospects aligns with the broader trend of institutional adoption and recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment opportunity. As the CEO of the world's largest asset management firm, Fink's positive outlook on Bitcoin carries significant weight and may influence investor sentiment towards BTC. \"$IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,\" Fink continued. The overwhelming success of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF reflects a shift in investor preferences towards Bitcoin, driven by factors such as inflation concerns, economic uncertainty, and diversification in investment portfolios. Bitcoin's unique characteristics, including its limited supply and decentralized nature, have positioned it as a store of value and a hedge against traditional financial risks. As BlackRock's $IBIT continues to experience rapid growth, Fink's endorsement of Bitcoin's long-term viability adds further credibility to BTC's role in the global financial landscape. The increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin related investment products signals a maturing market and a broader acceptance of BTC as part of a diversified investment strategy.",

    "article_summary": "As the halving approaches, BTC is being bought off the market at record pace.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The demand for US spot Bitcoin ETFs surged significantly on Tuesday, outpacing the new supply created daily by miners by a remarkable 614%, according to Gayatri Choudry, Quantitative Research Analyst at Bitwise Asset Management. Demand from US BTC ETFs exceeds new BTC supply by 7x pic.twitter.com/OCU5D19rpf — Gayatri (@GayatriPC_) March 27, 2024 The surge in demand for Bitcoin ETFs reflects growing interest among institutional and retail investors in gaining exposure to the digital asset, without having to manage the BTC themselves. ETFs offer a convenient and regulated way for investors to participate in the potential upside of Bitcoin's price movements while mitigating some of the risks associated with direct ownership and custody. The Bitcoin halving, scheduled to occur in less than a month, will reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event is significant because it reduces the rate at which new bitcoin is generated by half, making BTC more scarce over time. As demand for Bitcoin ETFs continues to rise and outpace new supply, the available bitcoin on the market is becoming drastically scarce. The combination of rising demand for Bitcoin ETFs and the impending Bitcoin halving have been the catalysts for the surge in Bitcoin's price this year, with BTC now up over 55% year-to-date at the time of writing. Since BlackRock initially filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BTC has risen over 173%. Market participants remain eager to see how Bitcoin will react to the upcoming halving, as this is the first market cycle in Bitcoin's history where its price reached a new all time high before the halving. Historically, it would take a few months for the 'supply shock' to jump start a rise in Bitcoin's price following a halving. But now, with demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs growing with no end in sight, Bitcoin has already experienced a big supply shock, and the new supply of BTC per day is about to get cut in half.",

    "article_summary": "The current state of Central Bank Digital Currency Projects globally summarized by Efrat Enigson, independent journalist and host of the \"You're The Voice\" podcast.",
    "article_detailed_content": "“What underpins a world order is always the financial system. We are on the brink of a dramatic change where we are about to, and I'll say this boldly, abandon the traditional system of money and accounting and introduce a new one. And the new one is what we call blockchain. It means digital. It means having an almost perfect record of every single transaction that happens in the economy, which will give us far greater clarity over what's going on. It also raises huge dangers in terms of the balance of power between states and citizens. In my opinion, we're going to need a digital constitution of human rights if we're going to have digital money. Most people think that digital money is crypto and private, but what I see are superpowers introducing digital currency. The Chinese were the first. The US is on the brink of moving in the same direction. The Europeans have committed to that as well.” This revolutionary speech about a new financial system, was delivered at the World Government Summit in March 2022 in Dubai, by Philippa \"Pippa\" Malmgren, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and Chatham House; her father, Harald Malmgren served as a senior advisor to US Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Ford and others. She’s a technology entrepreneur and economist, who served as Special Assistant to President George W. Bush, for Economic Policy on the National Economic Council and is a former member of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets and Corporate Governance. Her words about the transition to a new world order that requires a new financial structure correspond well with the words of French President Emmanuel Macron in June 2023 at the Global Finance Summit in Paris: \"The world needs a public financial shock to fight global warming, and the current system is not suitable for dealing with the world's challenges.\" The president of Brazil, Lula da Silva, also called for \"a clean slate\" and said the Bretton Woods organizations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund) do not serve their goals nor respond to society's needs. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact. Photo: Ricardo Stuckert/PR “The New Bretton Woods Moment” “A new international monetary system is taking shape, some call it the new Bretton Woods moment that needs to be seized to create a new global financial governance,” says the investigative journalist Whitney Webb in a recent sitdown interview, where she mention that according to Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England & Bank of Canada and the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, the three pillars of the new multi-polar world are Digital IDs, CBDCs and ESG, through a global carbon market. All world governments are pushing this agenda, that in order for it to succeed, all monetary systems and supporting systems must become digital and rely on digital data. A good example of this was revealed at an event of the Central Bank of Israel with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – which I attended – in September 2023 in Tel Aviv, where the “Genesis Project” was presented. As part of this project, \"green\" bonds are issued, based on carbon quotas in the CBDC infrastructure. This is how the climate agenda is linked to financial markets. “Debt Serfdom” “Stablecoins could be the way in which the US is further globalizing the dollar, spreading its adoption directly to the world’s general public in order to continue increasing its debt and encourage uptake and usage of the dollar”, says Mark Goodwin, Editor in Chief of Bitcoin Magazine, in this interview with Whitney Webb. He suggests that the politician’s outcry of de-dollarization and the weakening of the dollar are a distraction from perpetuating the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. “While CBDCs are what people are becoming fearful and aware of, it may just be the red herring, and the real strategy of the US dollar's survival is highly regulated stablecoins (such as Tether), which can easily be programmable, even more than CBDCs, as well as seized, regulated and controlled indirectly by governments. 100 billion dollars in treasuries were already purchased by Tether, its subsidiaries and owners. Tether is positioned alongside the top 20 nation states buying debt from the US, with around one tenth of China or Japan that have a trillion dollars debt to the US”. Whitney Webb & Mark Goodwin. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC9dJYqDZ9c This theory, together with the words of Mark Carney, Pippa Malmgren, Emmanuel Macron & Lula Da Silva, join the calls of global leaders and heads of states, pointing to the replacement of the monetary and financial world order, to introduce a new monetary system. Many experts say that we are reaching the end of the current fiat monetary system experiment, which is destined to collapse. Since world leaders are aware of this, they prefer to engineer a controlled demolition, to maintain control and steer the course, and enter the new era with power firmly within their grasp. Central Bank Digital Currency System (CBDC) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), tie the financial freedom of citizens to the government and the banking establishment. The central bank issues its centralized digital currencies, and essentially creates a new monetary system, \"fiat on steroids\", a system that takes everything that is bad in the fiat system, and adds more of it; surveillance, control, censorship, and enforcement capabilities. A modern prison? Indeed, the CBDC is the ultimate prototype of a prison without physical chains. By connecting CBDCs to digital identity cards, and to government systems such as universal basic income, social credits and more, we get the ultimate control apparatus. This apparatus will dictate to citizens what they’re allowed to purchase, what the permitted quotas are while limiting consumption according to rules and use cases, at programmed times, places and cadences. The system is able to determine the use of a geographic radius (geo-fencing), and to determine expiration dates on the money. Each remote controlled digital wallet can also be switched on and off by its operators. More than 130 countries are in the initial stages of piloting CBDC systems, of which 36 countries are in advanced pilots, and 3 countries have already launched systems (Nigeria, Jamaica and the Bahamas). Will Ripple (XRP) Be The Chosen Platform for CBDC? Ripple, a digital payment network and transaction protocol that owns the cryptocurrency XRP, is considered one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, and is strategically positioning itself at the heart of government financial innovation, aiming to be the cornerstone of future CBDCs. The company is in talks with about twenty governments around the world to develop their CBDCs using Ripple's technology. In May 2023, Ripple launched a dedicated CBDC platform to assist central banks, governments and financial institutions around the world in issuing CBDCs and stablecoins. To date, Ripple has partnered with six governments for CBDC pilot projects: Georgia, Colombia, Montenegro, Hong Kong, Bhutan and the Republic of Palau. The National Bank of Georgia, for example, has chosen Ripple as its technology partner for its CBDC pilot last year, citing Ripple's technical expertise and team capabilities. Its interest in CBDCs is in leveraging modern technologies, such as the programmability aspect of CBDCs, aiming to create a platform with smart contract and programmable token capabilities to stimulate innovation in the financial sector. In the case of Bhutan, Ripple’s technology was chosen in 2021 for the country’s CBDC project to enable advanced cross-border payments, and assist in “financial inclusion” - in line with Bhutan’s mission to increase financial inclusion in Bhutan to 85% by 2023. In 2022, Ripple reached the final stage of the G20 Techsprint CBDC Hackathon, hosted by Indonesia and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), and in August 2023, the Republic of Palau launched a USD-backed digital currency, developed by Ripple. Promoting its platform as an infrastructure for a CBDC, Ripple advocates for government regulation of cryptocurrencies, and tries to position itself as the preferred solution for CBDC projects. Its claim to fame of being the ideal CBDC partner for governments is the combination of speed, efficiency, a sustainable and \"green\" blockchain network that uses little energy (compared to the Bitcoin network), and interoperability - the ability to communicate and work with CBDC solutions in other countries on the Ripple infrastructure. The company warns that there is a risk for CBDC adoption by the public, caused mainly by a lack of market education, and it encourages the programming and expiration dates capabilities, which are perceived by most of the public as particularly Orwellian features of CBDCs. Ripple encourages the abolition of cash (and a move to a cashless society), and unsurprisingly, it promotes the climate agenda; The company's website presents its commitment to a clean, prosperous and secure low-carbon future, with a plan to reach carbon net-zero by 2030. Apparently, in line with Ripple’s expansion strategy vis-a-vis governments, the company makes sure to recruit employees who came from central and commercial banks. One of the company's top executives is Andrew Whitworth, policy director at Ripple, who previously worked at the Bank of England. At the same time as his role in Ripple, Whitworth also serves as a Director of the \"Digital Pound Foundation\", an organization that has declared itself the authority on the Digital Pound; it advises and influences the government's decisions regarding CBDC projects and deployments. Clearly an inside connection such as this might give Ripple an advantage in shaping digital currency policies to fit their platform and solutions. Does this hint a conflict of interests, or at least an unfair play? Another avenue through which institutional influence and implicit control over Ripple could manifest is via a legal battle with the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) concerning the XRP cryptocurrency. Engaging in such legal disputes inevitably positions Ripple in a scenario where maintaining a positive relationship with institutions becomes crucial. Consequently, it's no surprise that Ripple prioritizes governments, central banks, and financial institutions as its primary target audience in its market strategy. Photo: Lord XRP Twitter account Interesting Developments in CBDC China spent a couple of years rolling out relatively failed CBDC projects without widespread adoption, while injecting 30 million yuan as free money to encourage user adoption. Transactions using the digital yuan hit 1.8 trillion yuan (US$249 billion) in June 2023. Recently, significant progress has been made: the two main payment services and applications in China - WeChat and Alipay - which have a traffic of about 3-4 trillion dollars per year, integrated the Chinese CBDC service into their applications. The central bank regulator made it clear that digital yuan isn’t meant to compete with the two payments giants. Rather, it’s supposed to play a complementary role. Elon Musk, who owns, among other things, the Twitter/X platform, has stated that he wants to make the platform an \"everything app\" like the Chinese WeChat, including payment management. Will X also follow the Chinese route and integrate the CBDC solution into it, or will it try to become a CBDC infrastructure itself with the help of Musk's favorite cryptocurrency, the Dogecoin? The CBDC pilot in Nigeria didn't exactly take off either, after the citizens took to the streets to protest the abolition of cash in the country, and resented the introduction of an unneeded digital solution, while demanding the return of cash. After a long and painful protest, the cash was returned alongside the new digital currency, which was not canceled and became part of reality. Furthermore, a new stablecoin is in preparation in Sandbox mode in Nigeria. The cNGN is a Naira stablecoin which some claim has more potential than the e-Naira to be widely adopted. “The stablecoin will be more broadly interoperable than the CBDC, which is only available in the central bank’s wallet. At launch, the central bank’s wallet usability was weak, although it is now quite good”, said Bolu Abiodun, a reporter at Techpoint Africa. Source The UK saw a strong public backlash to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last year, with more than 50,000 responses sent to the Bank of England following a public hearing on the Digital Pound, aka the UK's national CBDC. Germany - Awareness of \"Excessive Surveillance\" In Germany, the technical guidelines document for a digital currency of a central bank was published in January 2024. Below are several quotes from the document, reflecting the tyrannical nature of the new currency, and the awareness of the central bank for trust issues it can create: Programmability is the institution’s authority to dedicate your money for certain uses, and to prohibit the use of your wallet when it is \"outside the permitted scope\". \"The central bank can revoke CBDC notes, e. g. as an instrument of monetary control. Revocation of CBDC notes is performed by an authorized entity, the revocation authority, controlled and operated by the central bank.\" This sounds like a technique to confiscate and apply a shelf life to money. \"Payments permitted under certain restrictions.. if the central bank sees fit to impose them\" - the document lists restrictions that can be applied to wallets, depending on the amount of personal information that will be provided. For example, the amount of money in the wallet, the number of payments per day, the amount of money per transaction or per day. The good news: The German central bank is aware of the possibility of public opposition to a surveillance system: \"Many of these design choices are general decisions on the trade-off between excessive surveillance and legitimate monitoring functions for AML and KYC purposes in conjunction with measures for mitigating fraud and misconduct. These decisions are extremely sensitive in nature and can strongly influence the level of trust that users place into the CBDC”. Israel - The Digital Shekel Will Be Distributed Through Commercial Banks Israel takes an extensive and active part in various CBDC pilots, such as the Sela project, Eden, Icebreaker and more, which I have reported on extensively in the past. The Deputy Governor of the Bank of Israel announced that in December 2024 a technical design document for the Digital Shekel will be published, and its implementation will then begin in partnership with the private sector. The Bank of Israel's latest document from last week covers the proposed architecture of the Digital Shekel. Here are some interesting points from the document: The distribution of the Digital Shekel will be two-tiered: instead of direct contact between consumers and the central bank for funding and defunding, an indirect method similar to the distribution of cash today will be used. The banks will purchase digital shekels from the central bank in large quantities and transfer them to customers upon wallet charging. The system will be able to apply and enforce limits, for example limits on the balance that users are allowed to hold in the Digital Shekel. The system will support the possibility of applying interest on the Digital Shekel. Users will be able to access the Digital Shekel through several payment providers, including credit cards, Google/Apple Pay, wearables, payment apps and more. Unlike most retail CBDC solutions, Israel's model allows users to open a wallet with a payment service provider (PSP) and connect to multiple third-party banks to fund and defund balances. Another interesting development in Israel is the announcement of a plan to launch a new stablecoin pegged to the shekel, called BILS, by the exchange platform, Bits Of Gold. Crypto Jungle website reports that the Israeli Capital Market Authority approved the pilot, according to the draft principles published by the Central Bank of Israel. Interesting to note that the company providing the infrastructure for the issuance and custody of the currency is the Israeli technology giant \"FireBlocks\", which took part in the \"Eden\" pilot project of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for the issuance of digital bonds, built to adapt in the future to a potential CBDC infrastructure. No Internet? Don't Worry, Governments Will Take Care Of Connectivity Anyway A number of CBDC pilots, like in India, the European Union and more, focus on the adoption of the system by everyone, even amongst people without internet access. The washed-up name \"financial inclusion\" implies that the system will not skip anyone, not even citizens without Internet connectivity in remote areas, or without reception. In India for example, there are 683 million people living without an internet connection and largely outside the control of the state. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to bring these remote areas into a new surveillance network through various technological means. A successful launch of CBDC in India also corresponds with the government's overarching goal of reducing cash usage and improving financial monitoring. Thailand - Free Money for the Masses In September 2023, the Thai government announced that any Thai citizen over the age of 16 who chooses to participate in the CBDC pilot, will receive free CBDC worth $280 (10,000 baht) - quite a lot of money in Thai terms. This digital money will be loaded into the digital wallet application and will be available for use within 6 months, and within a radius of 4 km from the residence of the registered citizens. The pilot targets low-income citizens as a first stage, and later expands to entrepreneurs and small business operators - provided they are registered in the tax system. In Thailand many citizens are not registered in the government systems and not everyone has a bank account. It seems that air-dropping \"free money\" is another tactic to lure citizens into government systems, with the bait of “free” controlled government money. But is there such a thing as “free lunch”? The European Union - a Positive Marketing Campaign in High Gear The European Union launched a marketing campaign to promote the digital euro about six months ago, to start educating the European public about a reality where that they will be obliged to use a supervised digital euro, led by Christine Lagarde, who was previously convicted of crimes and was promoted to serve as the governor of the European Central Bank, the ECB. The Digital Euro new marketing campaign. Source: Christine Lagarde’s Twitter account At the same time, a charade is going on in the European Union Parliament where the dangers of CBDCs are being discussed, only thanks to the public awareness and discourse, while Lagarde rushes forward and kicks off the marketing campaign to instill in the public the following messages: the digital euro is easy, safe, fast and reliable. Not a word about its Orwellian capabilities to track, program, limit and condition activity through expiration dates, geo-fencing, and remote on and off switching. Another ECB campaign video for the Digital Euro The Digital Euro Will Not Be Anonymous In a discussion at the European Union Council in 2023, Lagarde emphasizes a point: the digital euro will not be anonymous. Privacy will exist in the system, but not anonymity. Let’s break this up in a different way: for the banks, the key to surveillance and control is identification. The bank must know who the citizen is and verify their identity, in order to exercise law enforcement or regulations, through technological restrictions. Lagarde's claim that the technology will allow privacy but not anonymity is unfounded: apparently the central bank considers itself and the financial service providers some kind of God, since in front of them the citizen will be identified, and therefore it is not clear what kind of privacy can exist, without anonymity. Source: Christine Lagarde’s Twitter account In a presentation from March 2024, the ECB presents a timetable for the Digital Euro. In November 2025, the development and implementation phase will begin, with the completion of the \"democratic\" legislative process. The timing of the launch of the Digital Euro corresponds well with the European Union's initiative to issue digital identity cards to all EU residents between now and 2030, to enable the necessary government identification and tracking of its citizens. Identical initiatives are enacted and promoted in many other countries around the world at the same time. Where I live, in Israel, ID cards and passports have been mandatory and digital for many years, and also biometric since 2013 - therefore there is no need to start the marketing campaign for the Digital Shekel yet, as the digital infrastructure exists hence the first step of digitalization is already done. The timetable of the Digital Euro by the ECB This phase of the project is the \"preparation phase\", the ECB reveals, in which they are preparing for the launch phase of the Digital Euro. Of course, we are reassured that no final decision has yet been made regarding the launch of the CBDC, and this will only happen with the approval of the \"Government Council\" after the completion of the democratic legislative process of the European Union. Therefore, in parallel with the democratic debate for or against the Digital Euro, the development of the technology will continue, in order to be prepared for the launch. Central bank governors such as Lagarde and Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron insist that the CBDC is digital cash, and also insist that physical cash will not be abolished. It is possible that these central bankers feel the need to make a U-turn from the incriminating speech of the head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Augustin Carstens, who caused a public outcry when he stated in 2020 that the CBDC technology, unlike cash, will allow monitoring of financial transactions and will be a means of enforcement by the establishment: “The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control of the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression (money) of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.” Agustín Carstens - BIS General Manager The Future: Centralized and Controlled, or Free, Decentralized and Secure? Ayn Rand, author and philosopher, said that \"We can ignore reality, but we cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.\" Are we taking giant steps towards a new monetary reality, where the fiat currencies we know become fiat on steroids, aka CBDCs? Or into the reality of \"stable\" and closely regulated cryptocurrencies, tethered to fiat? Either way, the feeling is that the establishment is doing everything to preserve the debt economy, and its inherent modern slavery. The only way to break these fiat-matrix boundaries is to opt out and enter into a new system, which seems to run in a parallel reality, the Bitcoin system. On the Bitcoin standard, under self-custody, no third party has the ability to confiscate, program or take over private assets. Not even the government or the state. Bitcoin uses a lot of energy for its mining, but this proof-of-work mechanism makes the blockchain network extremely secure and the Bitcoin currency very valuable. Bitcoin is \"safe money\", which is out of reach for the establishment. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is a digital currency without intermediaries or third parties (peer-to-peer) in a decentralized and secure network, which allows everyone to be their own bank, instead of relying on banks and external parties. With a fixed and known supply, it represents the most powerful digital asset on the market as a store of value and as a unit of account, and in the future will also be used as a medium of exchange. In my recent interview with the media and finance expert, and one of the most famous Bitcoiners, Max Keiser, he compared the CBDC to a parasitic and centralized cancer: \"If you were to look at the amount of energy that Bitcoin uses and the rate at which it's increasing, you would say good is triumphing over evil. So this gives me a lot of hope. And I don't think centralization in anything works at all, except cancer. Cancer is the only thing that seems to work to be overly centralized and parasitic. That's the cancer model, but I think we're gonna win against the cancer of CBDCs.” Follow Efrat's work here. This is a guest post by Efrat Fenigson.

    "article_detailed_content": "Per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, United States Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is set to appear in Washington D.C. alongside Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA), to discuss the importance of maintaining the competitiveness of bitcoin mining in the United States. News of Lummis’s participation in The Bitcoin Policy Summit by The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) comes after comments made by the Senator in support of bitcoin mining earlier this year: \"Bitcoin mining is good for America’s energy grids and the development of new/stranded energy resources… Bitcoin miners, we’d love to have you in Wyoming.” Lummis has maintained a track record of supporting the Bitcoin industry and sharing viewpoints often-touted by those in support of sound money. Earlier this month, Lummis reiterated her support of sound monetary policy as a core component of her belief in American prosperity: “I’m pro-America. I’m pro-freedom. I’m pro-hard money… I oppose the debasement of Americans’ money.\" Interested parties may apply to attend the 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit. Enter code “bmag21” for 21% off tickets. Click here for more information. In a statement delivered to Bitcoin Magazine, David Zell (co-founder of BPI) recognized Lummis’s foresight as a Bitcoin advocate: “Senator Lummis has long-understood the importance of America getting public policy for digital assets right… When onlookers were predicting the death of crypto after FTX, Senator Lummis correctly insisted on the significance of Bitcoin and its regulation.” The Bitcoin Policy Summit on April 9th, 2024 at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. comes at a time of heightened partisan tensions with regard to Bitcoin and bitcoin mining. The Biden administration’s US Energy Information Administration (EIA) proposed an “emergency” survey of bitcoin miners and their energy use. The emergency survey proposal was subsequently dropped following pushback from industry representatives including Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) and the Texas Blockchain Council. Alongside Lummis and Thiel, The Bitcoin Policy Summit will feature presentations from global human rights activists, academics, and technology leaders with the aims to set the record straight on Bitcoin in the context of federal and local policymaking. Bitcoin Magazine, in collaboration with BPI, will livestream the Summit via social media including Twitter (X) and YouTube.

    "article_summary": "Casa Inheritance will ensure a smooth, KYC-free wealth transfer and protection against loss of digital asset funds in the event of death.",
    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin self-custody platform Casa announced that it’s launching a new inheritance product — Casa Inheritance — for its global customer base. Casa, known for helping crypto investors secure their BTC and other digital assets with multisig vaults, aims to make it easy for its customers to transfer their digital assets to their loved ones when said customers pass away. “What we’ve found through talking to our customers is that their family members do not know how to use a hardware wallet and do not want to [use them],” co-founder and CEO of Casa Nick Neuman told Bitcoin Magazine. “This [product] lets them have an experience that feels really comfortable. They just use the Casa mobile app to access [the] funds. It reduces anxiety [at] a time when they’re already feeling pretty anxious,\" he added. Casa Inheritance employs the technology that underpins all of its products: multi-key vaults. To access these vaults, a customer must use a combination of different private keys, a security protocol known as multi-signature or “multisig.” Casa Inheritance comes with a 3-key vault and costs $250 per year, according to a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. To unlock the funds in the vault, a user only needs two of the three keys. The setup and transfer process look like this: A Casa customer grants a recipient access to one of the encrypted private keys via the Casa app. If the customer is incapacitated, the recipient can request access to the vault via the app, which sets into motion a six-month waiting period. The customer is notified of the request. If they don’t decline it, the recipient gains access to the account with the private key the customer shared as well as another private key that Casa holds. All of this is accomplished without any KYC (know-your-customer) requirements. Originally, Casa only offered this type of service to its private client members, but in the wake of the spot bitcoin ETFs coming to market, Casa has received more inquiries from people looking to hold actual BTC and transfer it across generations. “After the ETFs launched, we’ve been getting more [inquiries] from people [who are] realizing that one of the really big benefits of bitcoin is that you can own it yourself,” Neuman told Bitcoin Magazine. “For people who are using Bitcoin as a hedge against systemic risk in the legacy financial system, you cannot hold Bitcoin in an ETF and still have that same investment thesis,\" he continued. \"So, [our new clients] have been thinking about their thesis and what types of solutions actually align with it. The one that aligns with that type of hedge is self-custody.\" \"So, then you need to think: Within the realm of self-custody, how do I make sure I have a solution that’s secure, easy to use and solves all of the problems that I would need to solve if I were holding a meaningful amount of wealth in bitcoin? And inheritance is a huge part of that. [They] need to make sure that wealth can actually be passed from generation to generation.” For more information on Casa Inheritance and Casa’s other products, visit the company’s website at https://casa.io/.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin U.S. spot ETFs saw a remarkable reversal this week, with a massive $418 million net inflow on Tuesday. This comes after the ETFs experienced 5 straight days of net outflows last week during Bitcoin's dip below $60,000. NEW: #Bitcoin ETFs saw a $418 million net inflow yesterday following five consecutive days of outflows last week. We are so back 🙌 pic.twitter.com/qfobpZOT5b — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 27, 2024 The turnaround signals renewed confidence among institutional investors, who have eagerly piled into Bitcoin ETFs since the first US ETF approval earlier this year. The SEC has now approved eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs after years of rejecting applications. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust ETF (FBTC) led Tuesday's surge. It saw a staggering $279 million in inflows, the largest single-day gain since its launch. The influx starkly contrasts last week's bearish sentiment, when over $200 million flowed out of Bitcoin ETFs as prices fluctuated amid a broader Bitcoin price dip. Now, with Bitcoin stabilizing around $70,000, institutional interest is returning. While Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continued bleeding assets, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw $162 million added on Tuesday. The total assets under management across Bitcoin ETFs are nearly $59 billion. The sharp inflow reversal underscores Wall Street's growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure via regulated investment vehicles. Bitcoin ETFs are passing their first real test in a volatile market environment. If the adoption trend persists despite market swings, Bitcoin ETFs could cement their status as the preferred Bitcoin on-ramps for institutional dollars. Their growth and resilience reflect Bitcoin's broadening mainstream acceptance.",

    "article_summary": "Arrested executive from Binance Nigeria escapes house arrest and flees the country. Rumors of a crackdown swirl in Africa’s largest Bitcoin hub.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. In Nigeria, home of the largest digital asset economy in Africa, a feud has been developing between the government and Binance—a feud that has culminated with one of the company’s executives escaping house arrest and fleeing the country. Boasting the sixth-largest population in the entire world, the Federal Republic of Nigeria holds a large economic influence over the African continent and a respectable sway in the greater world market. Although the possible future for Nigeria’s economic development has been a topic of great interest for global financial institutions, a particular point of interest is the nation’s apparent affinity for Bitcoin; for example, the country is at the top of nations by relevant Google searches such as “invest in crypto,\" etc. Additionally, due to some of the classic reasons like rampant inflation and declining local currency, Nigeria also contains the largest trading volumes in all of Africa. For these reasons, the possible bitcoinization of Nigeria would be a significant boon to Bitcoiners worldwide, and the country may one day be a real hub for the industry. Therefore, Bitcoiners today should certainly be interested in the developing feud concentrated between Binance and the Nigerian government, with special attention to the possibility of a broader crackdown on the industry. The quarrel began in earnest in February 2024, when an alleged “glitch” in Binance’s peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction platform led to deflated prices for users, as government officials formally accused the company of “blatantly setting a special exchange rate for Nigeria” and “trying to manipulate our currency to Ground Zero”. The Central Bank (CBN) considered the widespread usage of P2P Bitcoin transactions as a possible contributor to the naira’s falling performance, and sought to take action against Binance. Considering that inflation in Nigeria is climbing at the fastest rate in decades, this problem seemed especially concerning to authorities. Source To this end, a somewhat confusing series of events unfolded: reports circulated in February that the government was blocking services from major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Coinbase, for its part, claimed that they had experienced no such troubles with the Nigerian government at the time. The government went on to clarify its position when the CBN singled out Binance, announcing that some $26 billion in “untraceable” funds had apparently passed through the company’s operations in Nigeria. This quantity of cash would represent a significant capital outflow for the entire economy. Additionally, of course, such a large figure certainly reflects a relatively high level of interest and adoption in the broader population. After Binance refused to cooperate with allegations that it had enabled various financial crimes on its platform, the government took the aggressive step of detaining two executives—a British and an American citizen. This step led to a flurry of activities as the situation between Nigeria and the crypto economy became increasingly muddied. Was the government targeting Binance due to its recalcitrant attitude, or is it only the first step in a planned crackdown on the wider world of Bitcoin? The government shuttered the largest P2P exchange in the nation, but is the practice of P2P Bitcoin trading itself next on the chopping block? Nigerian regulators published an updated list of guidelines for foreign exchanges to follow, and the government additionally entered a new partnership to experiment with the feasibility of rolling out a CBDC, the eNaira. In the United States, the Chamber of Digital Commerce even pressured the White House to intervene in the situation, demanding that the American Binance official be released from custody. This tense and ambiguous situation came to a head in a very unexpected way when Nadeem Anjarwalla, a dual British-Kenyan national and arrested Binance executive, escaped Nigerian custody with a “smuggled passport” and fled the country on March 25th. Although his family claimed that Anjarwalla’s exit from the country was entirely legal, Nigeria has asked INTERPOL to post an international arrest warrant for him. Apparently, Anjarwalla’s guards allowed him to leave house arrest to visit a nearby mosque and attend worship services, where he disappeared. Not only have the guards been arrested pending an investigation, but the government has also formally charged Binance with tax evasion. Anjarwalla’s American colleague, Tigran Gambaryan, remains in federal custody and has been named as a defendant in the accusations. These certainly seem like grim portents for the Nigerian Bitcoin space, to be sure. However, the possibility remains that the government is merely attempting to strongarm Binance specifically, as the company has already been swamped with legal problems. In addition to the firm’s troubles in Africa, it has also suffered major setbacks on three separate continents. The most famous of these is the US Department of Justice’s fine: the company must pay $4.3 billion, and CEO Chengpeng Zhao was forced to resign, likely to face prison time. Binance.US was spun off to better accommodate American legal requirements, but even this subsidiary is mired in a series of class-action suits and SEC battles that will probably kill it. It would hardly be the first time, as CommEX, Binance’s successor in Russia after a similar exodus, just closed its doors on March 25th. The company was also blocked in the Philippines the same day, after the government accused Binance of operating without a license. In other words, the Nigerian government may have simply picked now as the opportune time to strike at a beleaguered rival, one who has long been a target of securities watchdogs in the country. To be sure, there are several worrying signs of a possible Bitcoin crackdown, as a Nigerian court ordered Binance to hand over data on its largest traders, accompanied by rumors that street crypto traders were being targeted by police. The investigation into the eNaira, a possible CBDC to replace the demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets, certainly did not help matters. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of reasons to see a path forward. For one thing, Paxful’s former CEO and NoOnes’ current CEO, Ray Youssef, was publicly enthusiastic about his company’s chances in Nigeria. Youssef suggested that Nigeria actually raise the registration fees for exchanges to operate in the country, calling the move an invitation to the “big boys” such as Coinbase or his own company operating in the Nigerian market. Youssef went on to state that the government has an interest in restricting these foreign conglomerates from acting as the main venue for P2P sales for fear of capital flight, and exchanges with zero or limited P2P functionality should be welcome to operate normally. Nigerian consumers have a high preference for P2P as the ideal method for buying and selling Bitcoin, and the possibility that $26 billion can flow from Binance’s P2P market to uncertain locations has shaken the government deeply. Nevertheless, the actual practice of P2P Bitcoin sales is alive and well in the Nigerian market without Binance as an intermediary; for example, International Women’s Day 2024 in Nigeria was marked by large and well-attended seminars focused on educating women from all walks of life on Bitcoin. Focused on demystifying the world of decentralized finance and empowering women, these seminars were sponsored by a wide variety of P2P channels, enthusiasts, and businesses in the Nigerian crypto scene. From where we’re standing, it seems that the rumors of a broader crackdown on Bitcoin in Nigeria have been greatly exaggerated. Considering that the government’s feud with Binance is rapidly escalating towards an international manhunt, it’s easy to imagine that the government would be making similar attacks on other exchanges like Coinbase or even the Bitcoin world altogether if it had any great interest in doing so. Binance has been perceived as a scofflaw towards Nigerian regulations for some time now, and it seems that their simultaneous legal battles in many jurisdictions have presented an opportunity for Nigeria to join in. The spirit of Bitcoin, however, is alive and well, and Binance’s competitors are more than willing to fill their niche in the market. It’s anyone’s guess as to how robust the Bitcoin industry in Nigeria will be five years from now, as the country’s economy as a whole continues to develop. One thing seems certain, however: It’ll take a lot more than one fight to keep Bitcoin down.",

    "article_summary": "Argentina’s plummeting economy has seen citizens turn to Bitcoin as a store of value. The legislature passes friendly laws as the pro-Bitcoin president has his hands full with the crisis.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As the Argentine economy is racked by record inflation, its people are turning to Bitcoin as a way to protect their economic security. The Argentine Republic is currently experiencing the worst inflation rates in the world. The nation’s economy has experienced low levels of inflation, somewhere around 25%, for decades; yet the pandemic sharpened a downward trend to devastating effect. The inflation rate hit 70% in 2022 and reached 100% the following February, but 2023 proved to be an absolutely murderous year for Argentina's economy. Inflation rates crossed the 200% point around the time that Bitcoin-friendly president Javier Milei first took office in December, and the rate currently sits at a mind-boggling 274%. With figures like this, ordinary citizens’ wages and life savings have evaporated practically overnight, and people are looking towards more radical solutions to get their lives on track. Source In a particularly encouraging development, ordinary citizens are turning to Bitcoin in record numbers for its classic use-case as a store of value. Already a nation with a high rate of Bitcoin acceptance, Argentina has doubled down on the decentralized currency as the most popular local exchange reports 20-month highs in trading volume. Lemon Cash, the exchange in question, claimed that Bitcoin transactions in the first full week of March 2024 were more than double the average rate throughout 2023. Belo, another prominent exchange based in the country, reported year-to-year increases that were closer to tenfold. A particularly interesting wrinkle in the development is that Bitcoin is not only replacing dollars, but also dollar-backed stablecoins which saw trading volumes decrease by 60-70%. Belo’s CEO Manuel Beaudroit stated that “The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad”. Ironically, Bloomberg claims, some of President Milei’s economic positions have actually influenced the switch from the dollar to Bitcoin, but through some unexpected and indirect means. The radical libertarian has begun his administration with a series of broad-reaching reforms to try and control the situation, reducing spending and attempting to dismantle or privatize a variety of state-owned businesses. A particular goal of his administration to date has been to build a budget surplus for the federal government, for a variety of reasons: using these funds more deliberately, reaching targets based on agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and of course beginning a positive trend in Argentina’s economic statistics. A component of this surplus policy has been to build a similar reserve of American greenbacks, reducing their circulation within the country. The exchange rate of pesos to dollars took a serious hit, and the once-popular store of value became less attractive than the skyrocketing Bitcoin. Reports from Chainalysis put some hard numbers onto these general trends: Argentina leads all of Latin America in transaction volume, and is second place overall in terms of grassroots adoption. Representatives from Lemon Cash estimated in this report that the number of Argentinians using Bitcoin or other digital currencies is around 5M, out of a population of 45M! Such impressive figures are not merely the result of a brief period of economic misfortune, but should instead be considered as a sort of tipping point: Bitcoin acceptance has been quietly growing for years, and now the crisis is providing the jump for it to become a fully mainstream fiat alternative. The rate of growth has been so prodigious that an unexpected “cousin” of the industry has even been developing, with crypto-related scam and phishing activity increasing fivefold. Clearly, the market is full of people new to Bitcoin’s chaotic ecosystem. Relevant to the rise of unsavory activity targeting new Bitcoin users, Argentina is beginning to pass some new regulations over the industry. The Senate unanimously passed a new law in March, opening up a new set of standards that virtual asset service providers must adhere to. The standards are generally related to various consumer protection and anti-fraud precautions, with the country’s main securities agency set to enforce these new standards. The existing Bitcoin community has reacted to these new laws with consternation, fearing that this legislation will lead to market consolidation. Large operations, after all, would have the resources to comply with these new requirements immediately, while smaller startups may find themselves swamped. Still, legislators are also working on a series of tax exemptions for digital asset holders, that may hopefully help smooth over some of this animosity. Curiously absent from these proceedings, however, is President Milei. The man espoused some pro-Bitcoin views on the campaign trail, and has a general economic philosophy that aligns with some of Bitcoin’s core fundamentals, but nevertheless he has held little public presence in many of Bitcoin’s developments. Even the incidental rise of Bitcoin fueled by his own policies have not led him to make public statements on the situation. Still, Milei has had his hands full from a far-reaching series of economic reforms and austerity policies, balancing the confidence of global markets with a concerning rise in poverty across several metrics. Milei has managed to slow the ballooning inflation somewhat, but at great cost: reduced government spending is pushing more citizens over the brink. As Reuters reported, the crisis is far from over, with sales, activity and production all on a downward slope. In other words, it seems likely that Milei personally has Bitcoin on the back burner, as he has a much greater priority in getting the economy under control and tempering the possibility of social unrest. His general popularity is holding up despite these adversities, but a contentious issue like bitcoinization may simply be a battle he is unwilling to start. Once things calm down, we may look forward to his endorsement of Bitcoin once again, but nothing is truly certain. Still, despite his lack of direct Bitcoin-friendly initiatives, the legislature is still making positive moves in its own right. It seems very unlikely that Argentina will turn actively hostile to Bitcoin in the face of this inflation, such as with Nigeria’s crackdown amidst a lagging currency. Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin in Argentina is up to the Bitcoiners themselves. Economic crisis has presented the community with record highs in adoption, and Bitcoin is well past a household name. Will this trend continue as the economy recovers? Will a fledgling community of Bitcoin-related businesses and developers end up transformed into a dynamic and profitable industry? There are too many variables to say for certain. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is a chaotic market that was itself founded in the wake of the United States’ own economic woes of the 2008 collapse. The worldwide community has displayed an innovative and enterprising spirit that can lead to success in even the most marginal situations. Bitcoin has been on the rise globally, in other words, and there’s no reason to doubt that it won’t keep rising in Argentina too.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Today, a freelance developer focused on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, Super Testnet, unveiled his latest invention, Hedgehog, a protocol for asynchronous layer two bitcoin payments. \"This is a protocol similar to the Lightning Network,\" Super Testnet stated. \"And that it is a layer 2 for Bitcoin payments, only in this one, unlike the Lightning Network, the two parties don't have to both be online, it's asynchronous. One party can send the other money then they're offline.\" One of the features of Hedgehog channels is its simplicity compared to lightning channels, according to the project's Github. State updates in Hedgehog channels only require the sender to propose an update, which the recipient can then accept at their convenience. This asynchronous nature allows for more flexibility and efficiency in payment processing. The protocol works by leveraging a primitive in Bitcoin script known as \"revocable connectors.\" These connectors are built on two even more primitive components: revocable scripts and connector outputs. Revocable scripts allow either party to revoke a transaction after a certain period, adding an extra layer of security and control. Connector outputs allow you to construct a pre-signed transaction spending a separate UTXO alongside the connector output, allowing the transaction to be invalidated by spending the connector output by itself. To illustrate how Hedgehog channels operate, consider a scenario where Alice opens a channel with Bob by sending a certain amount of bitcoin into a multisig address. Using the revocable connectors, Alice can then send off-chain payments to Bob while he is offline. These payments are embedded in a piece of text, similar to a cheque, and can be sent via email or other communication methods. When Bob comes online, he has the option to accept or reject the payment. If he accepts, he can cosign and broadcast the transaction to update the channel balance. If he rejects, he can propose an alternative transaction for Alice to consider. One of the potential problems that Hedgehog needs to solve is, for instance, if a party sends money to their counterparty they lose the ability to force close the channel because they do not have the other party’s signature. The protocol provides a conditional revocation mechanism. This mechanism aims to allow the sender to revoke a previous state conditionally, giving both parties a window of time to override the transaction if needed. Additionally, Hedgehog addresses the issue of funds being stuck in a multisig address if one party becomes permanently unavailable. By incorporating time-lock conditions into the script, the protocol can ensure that funds can still be accessed after a certain period, even if one party is unable to provide their signature. Super Testnet posted that he has an idea for how to use Hedgehog channels to build a federated CoinPool that he named Burrow. Those interested in that can learn more about it here.",

    "article_summary": "While Bitcoin is chiefly a system for transferring digital value, it is inherently and always will be so much more than just that.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The blockchain truly is a marvelous piece of technology. A mechanism to timestamp the order of digital information without needing to depend on a centralized operator. A decentralized mechanism with no one in charge, that provides undeniably cryptographic guarantees around what data was added to the temporal record in what order. This property is the entire reason Bitcoin is useful as a form of digital money, without it there would be no way for the system to function at all without a centralized authority. All of these guarantees are provided by three simple technical building blocks: private/public key cryptography, merkle trees, and hash algorithms. Every Bitcoin block is just some extra necessary data wrapped around the root of a merkle tree of all the transactions in it. The rest of the header includes data like the timestamp, difficulty target, block version, the hash of the previous block in the chain, and the random nonce used when hashing the head looking for enough leading 0s. Cryptographic Commitments, Publishing and Verification Miners don’t actually hash the whole block, and they don’t have to, because of how a merkle tree works. Each piece of data in a merkle tree is hashed, and then each pair of data units is hashed together upwards until you arrive at the single hash of the merkle root. Simply by mining over the header that includes that single hash, miners can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt all the transactions in the block were part of the block they mined, and that it pointed back to a single previous block with a specific set of prior transactions, and so on. In a similar fashion, when people sign Bitcoin transactions, they aren’t signing over the actual transaction’s raw bytes, they’re signing the hash of them. They’re the same thing in terms of cryptographic commitment. The way cryptographic commitments work in combination with proof-of-work are what guarantee we can have a linear view of what was cryptographically committed to in what order. This is the entire basis of Bitcoin, proof-of-work creating a material cost to adding to that chain, and using that to sequence all of the actual data (transactions) committed to in order to completely verify no funny business occurred. As a miner you can’t “mine” two different Bitcoin blocks at the same time, and you can’t fake digital signatures or break hash functions. The entire functioning of the Bitcoin network can be boiled down essentially to two things: committing to information, and publishing that information to be verified. Bitcoin provides two commitment guarantees in terms of data relevant to the protocol: that individual transactions were properly committed to by the correct signatures and other witness data, and that blocks bundling transactions have been committed to by an appropriate amount of work. This is what gives value to Bitcoin as a network and system, the commitment guarantees it provides using cryptography and thermodynamics, and publishing them so everyone who wants to can verify those commitments. Without the soundness of its commitments, and the public circulation of those commitments, it would be useless as a trustless money. Those properties of commitment, publishing, and verification are valuable far beyond the use case of money. The movement of money is by no means the only type of information that can gain value from a cryptographic and thermodynamic commitment to when it was created (or the earliest point it existed) and when its existence was publicized to the world. Jpegs have shown people value this for even pointlessly stupid arbitrary information, but there is information immensely more valuable than jpegs in this world. Density of Information You have to pay for blockspace when you transact on Bitcoin, and that blockspace is priced in bytes. For every byte of space you take up in that block you have to compete with every other person trying to use that blockspace to pay the going market rate, and anyone can always just pay more and push that rate higher. This gives denser information a competitive advantage in trying to get included in a block. If the density of information is very high, i.e. how many bytes of space you need is very small, you can use that blockspace while paying a lower fee in absolute terms than someone with less dense information. The use of blockspace to transfer economic value is one of the densest forms of information that can be included in a block. This will always be the case, and despite all of the drama and rabble rousing about Bitcoin turning into Ethereum, this will ensure Bitcoin’s primary use case remains the transfer of economic value. It is simply the most competitive use of the system in terms of information density. However, this does not mean that it will be the only use of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin truly does succeed, the reality is the current market frenzy and activity surrounding Ordinals and Inscriptions will die off. It will not be cost effective to engage in such activities as the cost of blockspace for lower net worth individuals, and as fees rise that dynamic will compound until the use-case is either priced out entirely or reserved to only immensely wealthy individuals. Maybe one day nation states will inscribe images or data to commemorate important historical events, but middle class degenerate gamblers won’t be inscribing jpegs like trading cards in the future. They will have to either stop playing those games, or take their games somewhere else. There Is No Blocksize Limit Merkle trees are magical. They can be literally infinitely large, and all you need to prove that a piece of data is part of one is the root hash, and the other hashes in the interior of the tree all the way to the actual piece of data. Cryptographic magic. The only reason the size of merkle trees in a Bitcoin block are limited in size is because users need to validate the contents of the entire block to ensure every transaction inside it is valid. Verifiability of the commitments in a block are integral to Bitcoin’s functioning as a system. You can stick a hash inside of an individual Bitcoin transaction, which means because of the magic of merkle trees, there is no such thing as the blocksize limit when it comes to the Bitcoin blockchain committing to data outside of the scope of Bitcoin transactions themselves. The same way that the small blockheader commits to every transaction in a block with a single hash, a Bitcoin transaction itself can commit to a massive merkle tree made up of immense amounts of data. This has literally been done before with the entire contents of Internet Archive. Earlier I said that transferring economic value is one of the densest forms of data that could utilize Bitcoin blockspace. One of, not the densest. That is because of general purpose timestamping. A single transaction, with a single hash embedded in it, can literally timestamp an infinite amount of data in a way that 100% proves it existed when that block was mined. It is impossible for any use case of blockspace to be denser in informational terms than this. Because everything in this merkle tree a transaction commits to has nothing to do with Bitcoin transactions, or whether or not they are valid, it can completely ignore the Bitcoin blocksize limit. On the other hand, it also cannot depend on the Bitcoin network to actually propagate the published information itself, but that is not a critical problem in the digital age. Using The Trees Satoshi himself in the recently released emails with Martii Malmi discussed the use of Bitcoin as a general purpose timestamping tool. This is something many people have done for as long as Bitcoin existed. Old projects like Wall of Eternity would let you pay to stamp messages into the blockchain. People have announced weddings, the birth of children, as well as other much more childish things using OP_RETURN on the blockchain for over a decade. This combines both the commitment and publication functions into a single action, but one that is incredibly inefficient in its use of blockspace. Opentimestamps Opentimestamps (OTS) is the perfect example of a scalable mechanism to facilitate at least the commitment aspect of timestamping. The publication of the data (as well as its commitment in the form of a merkle proof) is left entirely on the user timestamping the information, but the actual timestamping commitment is handled by the OTS Calendar Server. As users submit documents or files to the server, it bundles them up into an unordered merkle tree. It continues aggregating all the hash commitments of individual users files into a single tree until it conducts a periodic on-chain Bitcoin transaction which includes the current root hash of the entire tree it is building. As evidenced by the demonstration cited above, this can have immense value as a utility. Now that the entirety of the Internet Archive as of 2017 is timestamped using OTS, it is thermodynamically impossible to alter the contents of anything contained in that archive in a way that could not be detected. Centralized information stores such as the Internet Archive have historically functioned as what amounts to an oracle. They duplicate and copy the state of different pages or information and we trust them not to lie when they say “this is what that information looked like at this date.” With a proper Opentimestamps integration, they would never be a trusted entity in that way ever again. They would simply be a host that stores the information itself alongside an OTS merkle proof, and that itself would prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the information they are showing you existed in that form at roughly the time they claimed it did. The historical state of arbitrary information secured thermodynamically by Bitcoin. Mainstay Anyone even remotely familiar with timestamping knows that OTS has one major problem: I can timestamp as many different conflicting things as I want to, and only show you one of them after the fact. For many use cases that boil down to needing to prove a piece of data existed at a certain time, this is a detail that doesn’t matter, but for others it does. If I needed to prove that a piece of data was signed off by someone, say a corporate document signed by an executive’s private key, it doesn’t matter if he signed other (even conflicting) things with that key at the same time. All I’m trying to do is prove he signed one specific thing. OTS works fine for that. But imagine a situation where someone wants to attest to a file and prove that “officially” they have attested to only that file and not any others. Mainstay is a variation of Opentimestamps that addresses this problem. Rather than a completely unordered merkle tree, it’s very specifically organized in such a way that every user has a specific “slot” in the tree where they can commit to data. Now while this doesn’t prevent people from commiting to other conflicting data in general, when using a Mainstay tree they can publicly use an identifiable slot as their “official” commitment. Anyone verifying such commitments can then ignore or not treat as legitimate any commitment with a merkle proof located in any other part of the tree. Para-Consensus Systems The basic concept of Mainstay can be extended even further to create para-consensus systems piggybacking on top of Bitcoin, Stacks is probably the best known example. By committing the merkle root of arbitrary data in an ordered/identifiable way, and by publishing that information out of band somewhere else so it can be verified against arbitrary rules, a whole new consensus system can be built by anchoring itself into Bitcoin’s blockchain. Bitcoin itself doesn’t need to be aware of this in any way. Because of that fact, information that is consensus invalid to the para-consensus system can be committed to by Bitcoin and published out of band, but participants in that para-consensus system can simply ignore it and wait for the next commitment to valid data in their system. This can allow informational density of other economic assets to match that of arbitrary data timestamps. This might not be desirable, but it is unstoppable. Other Uses While tokens like Stacks are rather pointless uses of extending Bitcoin’s thermodynamic commitments in my opinion, some ‘assets’ that are not strictly monetary do actually have very sound use cases that could benefit from timestamping. Domain Names and namespaces in general are one. The entire way you interact with the web is steered by DNS, a centralized and trusted system. When you type in www.google.com a hierarchy of servers is telling your computer what actual IP address to connect to. Those servers can arbitrarily redirect you anywhere, they can deny people access to a domain, they can revoke domains, they have total control over those “directions” everyone’s computer listens to. An open and decentralized DNS system piggybacking on top of Bitcoin can address those issues. Rather than an authority granting access to a domain, any person can independently register and commit to a “name” tied to a cryptographic key themselves. Software can find published commitments to such data, and on a basis of trusting the first entries to be the “owner” of a domain, acquire directions to the correct server to connect to from a system that is open, decentralized, and cryptographically verifiable without a centralized authority. A Map of Space and Time Everyone fixates on the use of Bitcoin as money, and rightly so, it is the primary and core functionality of the protocol and network. The economic incentives its use as money creates are the core of what keeps it secure and functioning, it could not exist without that aspect of itself. It would collapse and fail without it. But Bitcoin is so much more than just that money system. It is a distributed timestamping system with a decentralized network for publishing everything the system commits to. It is a thermodynamically guaranteed map of digital data in space and time. One that is infinitely extendable. The blocksize limit governs the maximum size of Bitcoin transactions that can be committed to in a single bundle at a time, but it has absolutely no power to restrict any other type of data that the blockchain can commit to. Bitcoin is a thermodynamically driven blackhole in a digital era, and it will gobble up every byte of information into its merkle trees that in any way can benefit from the cryptographic guarantees that it can provide. Bitcoin is not just money, and no matter how many times people chant it is only money and nothing else, it will never be true. Bitcoin is a digital monster, and it will eat everything.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Introduction Names can be both liberating and confining. When mankind gives something a name, we mark it with a label that helps us discuss our shared environment and experience. At the same time, a label can obscure something in preconceived notions. Labels can make it more difficult for us collectively to understand what something is. In 2008, a pseudonymous inventor named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”1. The paper outlines a novel distributed network system, called Bitcoin, that acts as an immutable digital ledger. There are many ways to describe what the fundamental innovation here really was. For the context of this article, perhaps it is best to describe the innovation as the creation of a computer system that controls a database, which can only be added to or modified depending on the quantity of physical energy (in the form of electricity) supplied to it. Unlike standard computer systems, where linguistic logic coded by a programmer dictates the state of 0s and 1s, this machine changes when it is fed energy from the Earth. Integrating physical energy into the operations of the computer network was a pivotal moment for the possibility of creating digitally native money. Nick Szabo, in his work “Shelling Out: The Origins of Money,” provides an anthropological interpretation of how the use of money developed2. In trade, two potentially untrusting parties must find a way to trust one another. To do so, we can rely upon tokens of record that are governed by the laws of nature, which we all can trust. A commodity can be a helpful medium of exchange when it is scarce and hard to reproduce to the degree that people understand the extreme amount of energy and effort it would take to counterfeit one. Scarcity is how homo-sapiens detect the energy required to obtain a given object, giving it trust and validity as a unit of record. The greater the energy, the more desired and valuable it is in our endeavors to cooperate and trust one another. From this point of view, Bitcoin fits this description perfectly, it requires energy to produce and therefore is an immutable record that can be used as powerful money. However, as this distributed system evolves, it has become evident that the Bitcoin network does more than simply produce a digital, yet scarce, asset called bitcoin that can be used as money. For this reason, it may be helpful to momentarily give Bitcoin another name to reanalyze the broader function of this machine. For now, let us call it an entropy engine instead. Entropy Entropy is a complicated word that can be articulated in many ways. To begin, consider the equation: S = kB x lnΩ S, meaning entropy, equals Boltzmann constant (k) times the natural log of the number of particles (Ω) contained within a system3. Entropy can be described as the quantity of available states a system can have. If there is a big container with many molecules, it will have many more possible configurations than a smaller container with fewer molecules. The more particles the container has, the more variations there are in how the molecules can be arranged. According to the second law of thermodynamics, total entropy in an isolated system cannot decrease, but can only increase. Therefore, because entropy always increases, all the molecules eventually find the most likely arrangement, which is them all being spread out equally. This is known as thermodynamic equilibrium, and the universe tends towards this. The continuous increase in entropy is a law of nature. Due to entropy’s relationship with possible states, it is also related to randomness. Additionally, it is associated with heat loss. The second law of thermodynamics indicates that when one kind of energy is converted to another type of energy, there will inevitably be some heat loss. The conversion is never 100% efficient. Rub your hands together very quickly, and you will notice that the friction creates heat. This is you contributing to the increase in entropy of the universe. This new computer system is an entropy engine because it produces both randomness and heat. To add new transactions to the blockchain, a computer running the software must make many guesses until it finds a hash value with a certain number of leading zeroes. The quicker the machine can produce more random guesses, the more likely the machine is to be rewarded with bitcoin. The more randomness the machine can create, the better it functions and the more heat it produces. This machine involves all things entropy. The users of the machine also benefit from the entropy machine more if they can harness more entropy. The mathematics of entropy is foundational to the science of cryptography. Another way of interpreting the equation above, in terms of informational entropy, is that the more particles in a container represent the amount of information needed to understand the state of the system3. Put another way, the more possible states and complexity a system has, the more information one would need to gain an understanding of it. Consequently, more entropy represents more inherent uncertainty or surprise an event might have3. The entropy engine relies upon public-private key cryptography. A system user will have a public key where they receive bitcoin. At the same time, only they can send their bitcoin because they have the private key, which cannot be derived from the public key. The safe ownership of bitcoin relies upon an individual keeping their private key secret. Cryptographic schemes rely upon the assumption of highly random private keys3. In other words, the more randomness used to form a private key, the more secure one can protect their property on the network. Both the maintainers and users of the network utilize entropy for their benefit. Life is in Pursuit of Entropy Not only is this system an entropy engine from a technical point of view, but it can also be viewed as a driver of entropy from a societal point of view. The flow of human civilization can be reconciled with the observation that biological life facilitates the increase of entropy. Imagine a bathtub drain: once the drain plug is pulled, the water within the tub wants to flow down into the drain. Think of this as the universe’s tendency towards higher entropy. An orderly and sustained vortex will form at the drain to facilitate this transition expediently. Order develops to absorb and dissipate the energy, speeding up the process of generating more entropy more efficiently. Order, life, and all the complexity on Earth form to expedite the increase of entropy further as the sun transfers energy to the Earth. Plants grow to absorb sunlight and store the energy within themselves, and animals eat those plants to process the energy further, etc. Now consider the tell-tale sign of someone alive: their body is warm. Our body processes energy and dissipates some continuously as heat. Life forms in pursuit of entropy. Our society moves forward when we learn to find more efficient ways to harness and dissipate energy on Earth. A classic discovery we take pride in was our ability to release the energy stored in wood into fire, producing heat. We then learned to release stored energy within coal and then oil; eventually, we harnessed energy from wind and sunlight and finally upgraded to releasing the energy of atoms themselves. We absorb energy (in the form of wood, coal, oil, sunlight, wind, etc.) only to dissipate it for our gain. In the meantime, our society prospers and experiences excellent technological leaps forward as we learn to harness more advanced forms of energy. As we use the energy, heat loss occurs, and entropy increases. We act as the vortex: order that expedites the process. Humanity’s fundamental drive is to find and release pockets of stored energy. Interestingly, the entropy engine seems to provide an extra nudge, pushing humanity in this direction to a greater degree. Consider an undeveloped village with no electric infrastructure but near a river where a dam could be built. An ambitious entrepreneur may be interested in making a dam, but the capital expense is high. Additionally, it is not as if the nearby village will immediately purchase all modern electrical luxuries once the dam is built. At most, perhaps each home will gladly buy a lightbulb so their child can study school work after sundown. Though life-changing for the community, the revenue from one lightbulb a night per home is not enough to justify the capital expenditure of the dam. Before the invention of an entropy engine, many areas of the world would be without electricity for similar kinds of reasons. Now, an entropy engine operator is willing to purchase all unused electricity from the dam because cheap electricity leads to profit. The new customer provides a constant and complete excess inventory purchase of electricity for the dam. Suddenly, building a dam becomes economically viable. Before Satoshi’s invention, there were energy sources on Earth that humans did not yet have the financial means to harness. Suddenly, the pockets of energy become viable by inventing an entropy engine, and our harnessing of them multiplies. Not only does the business model of an entropy engine operator make previously unaffordable energy infrastructure affordable, but it also helps incentivize the development of renewable energy over the usage of less desirable fossil fuels. Energy grids require flexibility due to the electricity demand. The supply of electrons sent to a city needs to equal the demand for electricity at that time. Of course, a city’s demand for electricity will fluctuate throughout the day and year. An electrical grid needs to be able to dial up and down energy production in response. Currently, there are not enough batteries to store energy when it is not required. This challenges the development of renewable energy infrastructure, especially wind and solar, because nature decides when energy is produced, irrespective of the city’s electrical needs. If energy is not used, it is curtailed and wasted. If not enough is being produced, the city is without power. One reason fossil fuels are so helpful for grid stabilization is that production can be easily changed immediately depending on electricity demand. Of course, this problem could be mitigated if enough renewables were developed that could constantly produce more energy than peak demand. However, this would leave the energy providers without a customer for their excess electricity most of the time, making it financially unviable. Entropy engine operators can then incentivize renewable energy development by acting as a flexible load response that provides shock-absorbing services while increasing profitability in exchange for cheap electrical costs during times of excess supply4. Whatever electricity is not sent to the city is purchased by the entropy engine operators, making the capital investment in renewable infrastructure more economically viable. The same goes for nuclear energy, as these systems also struggle to conduct demand response on their own4. Therefore, research has shown that entropy engine operators provide additional revenue sources to incentivize renewable energy production and a greener grid4,5. Entropy: The Cause of War, and Now Peace Human civilization’s relationship with entropy and the entropy engine does not simply confine itself to how we are driven to harness, release, and use energy from a societal standpoint. It can also be looked at from a socio-political point of view. In a thesis titled Softwar: A Novel Theory of Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin by Major Jason P. Lowery of the United States Space Force, a description of how energy organizes around the laws of entropy is used to explain the pattern of human behavior around warfare6. Power projection theory describes how life formed, per the second law of thermodynamics, by using energy (referred to as power) to sequester other energy (referred to as resources) away from the environment to be used for more personal gain. It is another way of describing how order was formed to facilitate the increase in entropy. This can be observed not only in the first prokaryotic cells that formed in the hydrothermal vents that exist in the fissures of the seafloor but also in the way animals behave in the wild. Major Lowry uses the illustration of wolves snarling their fangs at a would-be thief of their recently acquired game to broadcast that the cost of stealing the resources would be higher than the benefit gained from the food. Here, the wolf is projecting power to keep its resources. Following such reasoning, pack animals such as wolves must create power hierarchies within their communities so that the most powerful wolf, most capable of efficient power projection, is fed and allowed to reproduce so that the pack can have the most power projection capabilities possible to protect their resources. To do so, wolves must physically fight amongst themselves in a competition of dominance. This is an unfortunate requirement, as two wolves will fight until one wolf has their fangs on the jugular of the other to prove superiority6. Therefore, the physicality required to create power hierarchies can prove dangerous and fratricidal. Other animals, such as deer, solve this issue with the development of antlers which allows them to use their antlers as power projection weapons against other species but leads to safe competition within their species as the antlers simply tangle as they butt heads without the risk of mortal wounds. In this way, the deer developed a biological method of managing internal power hierarchies using physical power with a decreased risk of fratricide. Major Lowry puts forth the idea that human beings, through language and storytelling, developed a form of abstract power projection in an attempt to organize resources without physical violence6. However, the universe tends toward increasing entropy, and physical energy is used to manage resource energy. Nature does not recognize the management of resources through any other means aside from physical energy. Therefore, human beings are stuck in a problematic cycle where we attempt to organize our societies and resources through abstract power projection, only to have them collapse under the weight of their hollow foundation through physical power projection. To our understandable discontent and frustration, war, civil war, and revolutions are constantly occurring as nature’s only proper mechanism of organizing resources. Though a bleak outlook on how humans must manage themselves, Major Lowry provides hope that the technological innovation of an entropy engine solves this crucial flaw in how our societies organize. The entropy engine is a means of managing resources using physical power. In other words, it acts as a technological antler allowing human beings to organize themselves following the laws of nature without the need for kinetic violence and fratricide. Rather than mutually assured destruction through nuclear warfare, the entropy engine promotes mutually assured protection as we all use the machine to protect our resources and each other simultaneously. Conclusion The operation of this distributed entropy engine relies upon the competitive production of entropy. Its users can secure their property most when using machines that produce the most entropy. It economically incentivizes, subsidizes, and makes possible the harnessing of previously untapped energy resources of the Earth. It also potentially reduces our need to fight wars in pursuit of resource acquisition because it allows us to compete over resources via other, more peaceful means. This entropy engine, Bitcoin, is accelerating human beings in fulfilling their cosmic purpose of facilitating energy flow in the universe. All while making society more resource-abundant, peaceful, and cooperative. If the second law of thermodynamics is inevitable, what does that make Bitcoin? References 1. Nakamoto S.

    "article_detailed_content": "El Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, and to adopt a Bitcoin investment strategy for its national treasury, has now accumulated over $400 million worth of Bitcoin. President Nayib Bukele led the effort to pass a law making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. Since then, the country has purchased Bitcoin through daily and periodic purchases announced by Bukele on X. In addition to direct purchases, El Salvador also generates Bitcoin through a passport program, converts BTC to dollars for businesses, and mines Bitcoin, all of which demonstrates the country's commitment to building a circular Bitcoin economy. Bukele recently revealed the government's Bitcoin address for the first time to the public. Bukele has stated that Bitcoin is held in a state-run \"piggy bank\" style cold storage vault. He also mentioned that they will be buying 1 Bitcoin every day until \"Bitcoin becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies.\" El Salvador has purchased over 5,700 BTC to date at an average price of around $42,700. With Bitcoin recently surging past $70,000, the country's holdings are up nearly $80 million. The president believes Bitcoin will help boost El Salvador's economy through tourism, remittances, and foreign investment. Bitcoin's fixed supply also stands to appreciate against the U.S. dollar over time. Bukele has frequently touted Bitcoin on X, stating,\" When Bitcoin's market price was low, [critics] wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses.\" Now, with Bitcoin soaring, the investment is paying off. While initially controversial, Bukele's Bitcoin play now looks prescient. If adoption continues accelerating globally, El Salvador's massive early investment could someday make it the world's first Bitcoin-rich nation.",

    "article_detailed_content": "In the wake of ongoing peer-to-peer (P2P) clampdowns in Nigeria, the country's Bitcoin community took a remarkable step towards empowerment by dedicating International Women’s Day to educating and uplifting women through Bitcoin education. On March 16, 2024, hundreds of women from diverse backgrounds ranging from students and entrepreneurs to professionals and homemakers, united by a shared desire to learn and grow in the digital age, gathered and participated in a series of educational initiatives aimed at empowering women by demystifying Bitcoin and decentralized digital finance technologies. Each session provided attendees with invaluable insights from top tier female experts in different fields of life. Tochi Onyia, Ure Utah, and Ifeoluwa Adegoke opened the attendees’ mindset to the unending opportunities awaiting them in finance and open source technology world, using their personal career journey as point of contact for young women towards exploring the intricacies of Bitcoin as a technology and its potential to transform their financial futures. Breaking Barriers Despite the regulatory challenges surrounding the Blockchain and Digital financial system in Nigeria, the organizers remained undeterred in their mission to empower women. By equipping them with knowledge and skills in Bitcoin, Open Source Tech and Business Analysis, they sought to break down barriers to financial inclusion and create opportunities for economic empowerment. The event hosted by the convener of Women In Bitcoin Club, sponsored by digital financial technology focused firms, Noones, DigiOats, BloccAfricaAfrica creative media and other indigenous P2P channels such as NickXchange proved to be a significant milestone in promoting financial inclusion and gender equality in Nigeria’s digital economy space. These leading proponents of decentralized technology and financial innovation, showcased their unwavering commitment to driving positive change and fostering a culture of inclusion and empowerment. Their participation was instrumental in making the event a resounding success and reaching a wider audience of women across Nigeria. Looking Ahead As Nigeria Bitcoiners reflect on the success of this groundbreaking initiative, they remain steadfast in their commitment to advancing financial literacy and promoting equal access to economic opportunities for women. With continued support from stakeholders, and a favorable regulatory landscape, they are poised to expand their reach and make an even greater impact in the months and years to come. In a time of uncertainty and upheaval, these have demonstrated resilience and resolve in educators efforts to empower women through education and technology. As the world celebrates International Women’s Day, let’s draw inspiration from their example and continue to work towards a future where all women have the knowledge, resources, and opportunities to thrive in the digital economy, specifically in Africa and the global south at scale.

    "article_summary": "Some thoughts on the difficulty of governments enforcing taxation in a world where Bitcoin is widely used in commerce.",
    "article_detailed_content": "How will governments function in a world that has transitioned from fiat to hyperbitcoinization? This is a question that I have thought about recently, and I wanted to think through what happens to governments on a Bitcoin standard. The questions I have are the following: how will governments fund themselves? How do your taxes work in a digital landscape, and how will governments respond to this dilemma? How Will Governments Fund Themselves? Most hardcore Bitcoiners probably could care less about what happens to the government on a Bitcoin standard. I would venture to say that they would want all governments to crash and burn. I sympathize with that point of view, but I am also a realist. The average person wants the government around because they have been conditioned to believe it brings a sense of order and protects its citizens. I think it is the opposite, but this isn’t a majority view. Governments of different sizes and configurations have existed for thousands of years and will likely still be around when hyperbitcoinization is realized. So how will governments fund themselves when the power to create money on a whim has been irrevocably taken away from them? In the West, governments primarily tax income as a major source of revenue because they have the ability to surveil most transactions through payment rails controlled by the Federal Reserve, banks, and through the threat of force and imprisonment. This has worked for them for a long time, but this will no longer be possible on a Bitcoin standard. The very nature of Bitcoin makes the tracking of the income of every economic participant virtually impossible and very time-intensive, especially when privacy tools such as coinjoins and lightning are thrown into the mix. You can start to understand why governments don’t like Bitcoin, it takes away their power. Without the power to wantonly tax individuals, governments will be forced to develop methods to generate revenue to sustain themselves. More on that later. The Bitcoin Economy Of The Future Imagine a future where everyone buys and sells goods peer to peer using Bitcoin. This, by default, would be a tax-free economy. Currently, there is no line of code in the Bitcoin protocol that can calculate sales tax when you buy goods, and no Bitcoiner would even consider creating something like that unless they want to be tarred and feathered as simp for the government. I don’t even know if that is technically possible to do, to be honest. Nobody likes paying taxes and wouldn’t shed a tear over not having to pay them anymore. This creates another dilemma for governments around the world. If they can’t tax income and they can’t effectively tax consumption, what alternatives do they have to sustain themselves? There is no simple answer to this. I think our whole concept of what government is and how it relates to its people will have to radically shift from a top-down concept to a more decentralized customer service model. This is more in line with the libertarian worldview of what the state should look like, where governments are voluntarily funded by their citizens instead of being compelled to fund it through the barrel of a gun. Under this model, governments will have to be much smaller than they are today as they would have to be mindful of revenues versus outlays, just like any business would. If the governments are good fiscal stewards of their Bitcoin treasuries, citizens will be far more likely to reward governments with continued support. This form of a signal of support has more influence than voting. The ability to withhold funding will make politicians more responsive to the people. Elections could still be held as this wouldn’t have to change. Political parties would have to show they are good stewards of capital, or the government wouldn’t get voluntarily funded and would naturally fall from power in the next election. This is a world that I think we should be working towards, as it will make the world a safer place for everyone. How Will Governments Respond To This Emerging Challenge? While this might sound like music to our ears, politicians hate the idea of Bitcoin or having to be responsive to the citizenry. They have it pretty good right now as it is. They get to tell people what to do, get good benefits, and get reelected even if they break their promises—no wonder they never want to leave office. In America, incumbents get reelected north of 90 percent. Did you know in the House of Representatives, the reelection of incumbents has never dipped below 85 percent? So you only have 15 percent of being voted out in the next election. Who doesn’t like those odds? This is why nothing changes. We get the same people in office year after year because they know how to play the game and grease the right palms, all thanks to the fiat money printer. If you want to see all the BS the federal government spends on their depreciating fiat dollar, check out the Citizens Against Government Waste website. This will give you a good idea of the crap that is being funded in your name. So, knowing this, do you think they will willingly give up all this power, prestige, and influence? I don’t think so. They will employ various tricks to either capture Bitcoin for their benefit or make it so cumbersome that people won’t use it. I fear that Bitcoiners have already fallen into one of their traps with the Bitcoin ETF. I sincerely believe this was a wrong move and can tremendously slow down the adoption of Bitcoin in the US. Sorry to say, but most people want quick and easy regarding anything in life, even Bitcoin. Answer this question: Why would those with very little knowledge of Bitcoin learn the ins and outs of self-custody, and why is it important when they can “own” Bitcoin in their retirement account? 9 out of 10 people are going to choose this option. As long as they see their retirement portfolio rise because of Bitcoin, they will gladly oblige to having large custodians like Blackrock hold their Bitcoin, not understanding how dangerous third-party custody really is to Bitcoin. At least we have a chance with Bitcoin to improve the world. Let's hope people take the opportunity to achieve real freedom. This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

    "article_summary": "Using grain as an historical example, the importance of not having the same entity that hold funds in custody handle trade execution is demonstrated.",
    "article_detailed_content": "FTX’s collapse demonstrated the wisdom of segregating the activities of market making on the one hand (Alameda) from those of running an exchange (FTX) and a custodian (FTX again) on the other. However, the question of whether to segregate the activities of operating an exchange and a custodian is more nuanced. Large banks often run their trading businesses and their custody businesses in the same legal entity, using information walls to control for conflicts of interest and ensuring that their own assets are segregated from those of their clients. This paper will use the experience of the US grain industry in the late nineteenth century to illustrate the importance of controlling the risks between custody and execution activities. Cryptoasset Custody Cryptoasset custody is a complex undertaking involving, among other things, managing information security risk to protect private keys and keep transactions secure. Custodians also act as a form of payment service provider, receiving cryptoassets and sending them based on the instructions of their clients. Many of the early cryptoasset exchanges bundled custody with execution for their largely retail client base and some continue to do so. When they first launched, the exchanges had to build the capability to safeguard their own assets. Extending this capability to their largely retail client base for free created much stickier client relationships and was an oblique way of monetising the sunk cost of their in-house custody arrangements. Since FTX’s failure there have been both private sector and public sector efforts to change this model. The private sector has seen wider adoption of ‘Off Exchange Settlement’ (OES) by the large exchanges, often in response to the demand of institutional clients. OES seeks to mitigate counterparty risks by removing the need for clients to keep their cryptoassets at exchanges. This, incidentally, is how Zodia Markets was designed from inception. In the public sphere, there have been regulatory measures such as those by the SEC calling for Investment Advisors to only use Qualified Custodians for their clients’ cryptoassets. There have also been consultations such as the one by HM Treasury in the UK, which signalled support for the segregation of client assets from those of the exchanges those clients use. Cryptoasset Exchanges Cryptoasset exchanges and traditional exchanges had similar origins insofar as most began as informal venues for retail customers. On the cryptoasset side, Coinbase started as a private service to buy and sell Bitcoin through bank transfer, while Mt. Gox started as a trading service for card collectors. In the traditional world, the LSE started out as a private association of traders based in John’s Coffee House in the City of London, while in medieval Belgium traders convened at the Huis ter Beurze, a tavern, which gave its name to the term ‘bourse’, as in Deutsche Börse. Taking a broader perspective, exchanges are designed to fulfill five functions: Standardization, such as through weights and measures or consistently designed trading contracts, Protection of property rights, such as through rule books, Enforcement of contractual agreements through sanctions for bad actors, Mitigation of information asymmetries by disseminating information, often through a transparent order book and Providing public goods by ensuring rules are adhered to. Judicial and legislative sanctioning of these rules by the state tended to follow, rather than the other way round. Omnibus and Segregated: Elevators and Sacks The development of grain exchanges in the late nineteenth century United States, particularly the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), helps illustrate the tension between custodians on the one hand and exchanges on the other. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, the quantity of grain shipped to Chicago grew dramatically as the United States expanded west. Storage elevators operated by warehousemen were large, specialized warehouses where grain was kept in bins before shipment. In a sense they are equivalent to omnibus cryptoasset custodians where the assets of various owners are commingled in a single wallet. The CBOT started out as a sleepy organisation, even having to encourage attendance at its meetings in the 1850s by providing free meals. The exchange grew to play a role in standardizing the grading, inspection and weighing of commodities, including grain, which is function 1 in the list above. The warehousemen who operated the elevators were at odds with the traders and shippers of the grain, who were more aligned with the exchange. The storage of cryptoassets involves, among other things, the indexing of the chains and asset screening. Blockchain indexing eases the process of finding information stored in the blockchain rather than analyzing data block-by-block. It does this by parsing and storing the data in a centralized database where it can then be queried. Indexing is a form of confirming the on-chain property rights of the custodian’s client. This is function 2. Certainly, clients could do this themselves, but it is much easier to pay a custodian to do it on their behalf. Screening and scoring are a financial crime monitoring measure that has no real equivalent in traditional finance, since it is specific to blockchains. Private firms provide scoring services to assess the financial crime exposure of a particular asset or wallet. If an asset or wallet has recently interacted with an address that is known to be associated with criminal activity, then the score is adversely impacted. This means that the notion that cryptoassets are perfectly fungible is not strictly accurate. Different wallets and assets have different scores. Where custodians operate omnibus wallets, so this affects the score of the overall holdings by commingling assets of different scores. The same was true of grain in that it is not nearly as fungible as one might imagine. There are different grades depending on the growing area, such as Russian Rye wheat, River Plate wheat, East India wheat and so on. Other grading criteria included, for example, moisture content, foreign matter, and damaged grains. The challenge in the United States was the scale and sophistication of the custodial infrastructure that collected grain into elevators before being transported. This was different from countries like Argentina where the infrastructure was less sophisticated, and grain was parceled into sacks for shipping. Custodians that operate separate wallets for each of their clients are analogous to the grain sacks of Argentina. Omnibus grain elevators created economies of scale through quantity and scale. However, this came with the trade-off of making it harder to track quality compared with using grain sacks that could be tagged with a particular grade from the point of packing to arrival at the end customer. In cryptoassets omnibus wallets also create economies of scale, such as reducing on-chain transaction costs, but the scoring of individual sets of assets becomes more challenging if not impossible. The Risks of Comingling and Custodians trading on own account The commingling of grain allowed the warehousemen to engage in unscrupulous practices. For example, they could receive a shipment of grade one grain and then mix it with grade two to the point that it was still just within the acceptable range for a one grade. As a result, the warehouse was able to improve the quality of grain on its own account to the detriment of others. This of course resulted in a dead weight loss for those who had high-quality grain stored at the elevator. This discouraged farmers from ensuring their grain was of the highest quality. Further down the supply chain, shippers engaged in mixing to be as close to the threshold between grades, so the loss to the warehousemen would be minimized. In some senses there is a Gresham’s Law at work, with poor-quality grain driving out good quality grain. In summary, standardization and the protection of property, functions 1 and 2, became flawed. One key difference between cryptoassets and the grain markets is that the grading and scoring of cryptoassets is conducted by third party private sector companies, since the data is public and anyone can do it. However, omnibus wallets do limit this capability since a great deal of trading activity can take place off-chain and then net settle to the omnibus wallet. Another source of tension revolved around function 4. Warehousemen, who could trade on the exchange but also traded off the exchange in private transactions, had information about supply and demand as well as the qualities of grain in storage, thus creating a conflict of interest. While this information was their property and the treatment of information as property does act as an incentive to owners to produce and sell that information, there is a counterargument that mandatory disclosure can help prevent insider trading, market abuse and adverse selection. What is key is where the warehousemen were able to commingle their own assets with those of their clients and where they were able to trade on their own account, they had the temptation to engage in abusive and illicit practices, which put them into conflict with the CBOT. It is no surprise that the responses to HMT’s consultation calling for firm and client assets to be segregated were overwhelming. The CBOT had a long-running conflict with the warehousemen as it struggled to apply the same standardization of weights, measures, and grades as it had in other assets such as lumber. In 1906 the CBOT implemented the Call Rule that required that any private trades concluded off the exchange had to be at the closing price for the day. The warehousemen were more afraid of expulsion from the exchange than the costs of adhering to this rule so they adhered to it. The rule was also given judicial backing on this important market function. This allowed the CBOT to manage the conflict of interest around the warehousemen being able to trade on their own account, but critically that was not done by banning them from trading. All of this meant that the economies of scale of elevators could be retained, while allowing for the conflicts of interest and other issues of tension to be managed. What is readily apparent is that banning elevators or preventing warehousemen from trading was never a realistic option. Technology and the economies of scale that it brought was held to be a fundamental good. Yes, it introduced new risks but over time the market and the regulators were able to manage these novel risks under a model that has operated for over a hundred years. One hopes that the same attitude can be brought to bear in the cryptoasset markets. This is a guest post by Nick Philpott.

This API marks the company's expansion into international remittances, with plans to extend services to the USA, Canada, Europe, Asia, and Africa soon. We're excited to launch our new Remittances API powering instant, cross-border payments for any app 🚀 One easy integration to send Mexican Pesos 🇲🇽 or Brazilian Real 🇧🇷 to local bank accounts in under 1 second⚡ More currencies & countries coming soon!https://t.co/jiAeh1NhRF pic.twitter.com/R63Z3mNnb3 — The Bitcoin Company (@theBTCco) March 22, 2024 “Disrupting the remittance market is a key milestone in our roadmap to provide easy to use Bitcoin-native financial services and has always been a compelling application for the Bitcoin network,\" said Ben Price, Founder and CEO of The Bitcoin Company.\" With Bitcoin, payments can be cheap, instant, inclusive, and global.\" By leveraging the Bitcoin network, The Bitcoin Company's Remittance API offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional banking rails like SWIFT, reducing international remittance costs significantly. The API communicates with local payment networks in Mexico (SPEI) and Brazil (Pix), ensuring funds are deposited instantly into recipients' bank accounts. The remittance market in Mexico and Brazil has historically relied on costly services like Western Union and MoneyGram, which charge high fees. According to the World Bank, remittance payments to Mexico and Brazil cost 3.01% and 4.59%, respectively, with an average international remittance cost of 6.18%. The Bitcoin Company's API disrupts this landscape by providing low-cost, instant, and 24/7 cross-border payments. \"Cross-border payments as they exist today are broken,\" Price continued. \"Traditional remittance providers like Western Union are taking advantage of the world’s most desperate populations by charging exorbitantly high fees for sending/receiving money. Cross border payments are now trivial with our new Remittances API that leverages the Bitcoin network. Our plans include expanding to more regions and currencies to service both business and consumer payments. We’re so happy to help enable other developers to turn on low-cost, cross-border, instant payments in their applications with a simple API integration.\" This launch aligns with The Bitcoin Company's vision to provide easy-to-use, Bitcoin-native financial services and build developer-friendly infrastructure connecting Bitcoin with legacy financial systems.

    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin is a completely decentralized system, there is no ability to reverse payments, and there is no customer support line where you can call for help if you mess something up. When you take self-custody of your own Bitcoin, you and only you are responsible for the safety of your funds. Self-custody also means that no one can freeze your funds, and no one can stop you from making a payment you want to make. It’s a double-edged sword: there are huge benefits to self-custody, but it also comes with responsibility. If you make a mistake and send Bitcoin to the wrong address there is no undoing it. Then if someone can access your seed phrase (seed words), there is no customer support to help you, that person now has access to your money. If you lose your keys and your seed phrase backups, there is no recovery process to get your wallet back. It’s very much like cash in that regard: once it’s gone, it’s gone. People generally go through life with no existential anxiety over having small amounts of cash but protecting significant amounts of money presents a source of worry, and Bitcoin is no different. Custody and Crypto Wallets When it comes to managing your Bitcoin, there are multiple types of wallets you can use. However, not all of them offer you true ownership of your assets. Here's a breakdown of the types of wallets you will encounter and how they approach self-custody. Custodial Wallets Custodial wallets are generally offered by centralized exchanges, the same platforms that allow you to buy Bitcoin with fiat currency. These wallets work essentially just like a bank account. You do not actually have any control of your money. They can freeze your funds, lock and close your account, and deny you permission to make transactions or withdrawals with your own money. They do offer the potential to transact very cheaply with other users of the same wallet, but at the cost of giving control over your money to the custodian. They should never be used to store any significant amount of money, and any Bitcoin you purchase should be withdrawn to a non-custodial wallet as soon as possible. Non-Custodial Wallets Non-custodial wallets all offer true self-custody: only you have access to your assets. But even wallets that offer self-custody come with a range of trade-offs. They can also serve different purposes. Software Wallets, also known as hot wallets, run on your mobile phone or your laptop computer. They do leave control over your funds in your own hands, but they manage and store the private keys on your device. This exposes them to the risk of compromise by hackers. You should only protect small amounts of money with a software wallet, what you reasonably expect to spend in a short time period. A hardware wallet is a special device designed to keep your private keys as secure as possible. These devices are what you should use to store the bulk of your Bitcoin. They keep the private key offline and inaccessible to any threat from hackers, and allow signing transactions in a secure environment. A special note when using hardware wallets, the vast majority of them have a screen on the device that is used to display information about where a transaction is being sent before signing. Always double check the address and amounts shown by your device when signing to make sure the money is being sent to the correct place. How to approach Self-Custody Here are some basic steps you can take to ensure you are interacting with your Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner: Test Your Backups The first thing you have to do when taking custody of your own funds is to generate your seed words, also known as a seed phrase. This is like the master key to all of the accounts you will create with that wallet. When you first complete the wallet setup, your wallet will generate a random number called a seed, or entropy. From there, your wallet will translate this number into 12-24 words called a seed phrase, or seed words. Any wallet that is properly designed to encourage user safety should have you verify and prove you wrote down the seed phrase by challenging you on some (or all) of the words in it. If you are managing significant sums of money, it is always safest to double-check. To follow, you will need to generate an “account” which will create your wallet’s first receiving address, which looks like this: bc1q653jc5hxawj5lwxgm8tt73qzw6rurmc5d42qd2 It never hurts to be safe and double-check things. After you’ve finished setting up your wallet, but before you start transacting, you can reset the wallet and re-initialize it. Instead of generating a new seed phrase, you can import the one you just backed up. If the first Bitcoin address is the same, you can be sure you’ve correctly backed up your seed phrase. Send A Test Transaction When it comes to making your first withdrawal from an exchange it can be a bit nerve-wracking. Is this address correct? Did I make a mistake? One of the scariest things for many people about Bitcoin is the digital nature of it. Everyone has in their mind this image from a movie scene where someone teenage hacker compromises a government system to further the plot. Most people don’t understand the first thing about how computers work, but they understand there are numerous ways they can be compromised or hacked. I don’t know about you, but when there is a risk I am aware of that could affect me and I don’t understand how that risk exposes itself to me, I get worried. Just like verifying your seed phrase by recovering the backup before using the wallet, you can send coins to your wallet slowly. If someone were to compromise how you generated your wallet in the first place, they would be able to take any money you send to that wallet the instant you send it. So just don’t send all of your money at once. Send a small test transaction with a tiny percent of the Bitcoin you intend to take into self-custody. Make sure those funds actually show up in your wallet first. To really be sure, you can even make sure that you can spend those coins by sending them back to the next address in your wallet. After making a test transaction and ensuring that you have the keys needed to spend money sent to that wallet, you can deposit the rest of your money to that wallet. After a small test deposit without seeing such a transaction occur that you didn’t initiate, you can have much greater confidence that your wallet was set up securely. NEVER Create Digital Seed Phrase Backups Your seed phrase backup is your money. Whoever has access to your seed has full access to your funds. There is no customer support line to call, there are no chargebacks or insurance coverage for stolen funds in non-custodial Bitcoin wallets. If you mess this up, what’s done is done. Hardware wallets that you actually use to sign transactions are specifically designed to hold the private keys your seed generates securely. When you make a backup of your seed phrase it should strictly be on something analog; a piece of paper, a steel plate with punched letters, something physical and completely offline. You should NEVER do something like take a screenshot or picture of your seed phrase on your phone, or keep a backup in a text document or Google Cloud or iCloud. People’s computers and internet service accounts get hacked and compromised on a regular basis at very large scales. Only keeping your keys stored on a physical medium like paper, and a secure device like a hardware wallet immensely lowers your risk of your coins being stolen through the compromise of your seed phrase. Your iCloud account can be hacked remotely from anywhere, whereas the seed phrase backup on steel in your safe requires someone to physically break into your safe. Multisig Requires Extra Backups! If you are using a multisig wallet, the seed phrase backups are not enough to recover your funds. The point of multisig is to increase your security by requiring more than one key to sign to spend your money. Typically, they will require a minimum threshold of devices that must sign each transaction. For example, it might require 2 out of 3 signatures. This ensures that someone compromising or you losing a key or two doesn’t result in losing your funds, but it comes with a nuanced catch. You can lose some of the private keys in a multisig, but if you don’t keep all of your public keys, you won’t be able to find your Bitcoin on the blockchain to spend in the future. This is due to how multisig wallets create the information necessary to process transactions. When you make backups for a multisig wallet, each individual private key backup should also be accompanied by a backup of the public keys (wallets will call this an “xpub”) for all of the wallet addresses involved in the multisig. This ensures that you can find your coins on-chain even if you lose access to one of the accounts. Never Talk About Your Stack Being involved in Bitcoin can be a very exciting experience, especially when the price is going up. This can also be a liability depending on who knows about your Bitcoin holdings. As was mentioned earlier, if someone can gain access to your seed phrase they gain access to your money. Bitcoin has the potential to become immensely valuable in the future. Owning Bitcoin is not a fact that you should be parading around to the whole world and everyone you know. Obviously, if you are married it will be very difficult to keep a significant sum of Bitcoin secret from your spouse. If you have very close friends, it's something likely to come up or be observed by them over time. But you don’t have to go telling everyone you meet that you own Bitcoin. And you shouldn’t. As Bitcoin has increased in value over the years, physical attacks on Bitcoiners in order to steal their money have become more and more common. The more people who know you hold Bitcoin, the greater your exposure to potential risks like that. Don’t go blabbing your mouth off to everyone you meet about your Bitcoin stack. Wrapping Up Bitcoin can be, although it shouldn’t be, an intimidating thing to take possession of. It’s just like cash in a way, if you lose it no one can do anything about it. But in other ways, it's not quite like cash at all. People are worried about holding large sums of cash because if you lose it or someone steals it, it’s gone for good. Bitcoin can be backed up. If you lose your Bitcoin, you can literally just magically get it back if you have a backup. That’s because your Bitcoin isn’t in your wallet, your Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain. If you have a copy of your seed phrase you can regain access to all of your BTC no matter which wallet you use. You can’t just “back up” physical cash. A xerox copy of cash isn’t cash, and won’t be treated as such by anyone. But a Bitcoin word seed phrase restores your access to your Bitcoin instantly. That should be an alleviation of anxiety when comparing Bitcoin to something like cash. Multisig wallets offer an option to defend against theft. When you have a safe full of cash at home, someone can simply break into your house and take all of it. With a multisig Bitcoin wallet, if you only have a single key at home with you a thief cannot take your Bitcoin by breaking in and taking the key you have at home. This is something that cash cannot do. Larger amounts of cash are a large incentive for thieves to target you. But if they don’t know you have a large amount of cash, they have no reason to target you. Just don’t tell them about it. Bitcoin isn’t a special variable here. Bitcoin can be intimidating to self-custody because of the risks it shares in common with cash, but when you really take the time to learn what tools are available to help you self-custody it, it's not that intimidating. In many ways, it can be safer than cash to hold yourself. So stop worrying, have a little patience, and slowly take the time to learn the basic things you can do to protect your stack yourself. After a little while you won’t even think twice about it.",

    "article_summary": "SRI 1.0.0 is officially here, bringing significant upgrades in enhancing and decentralizing Bitcoin mining operations.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI) team has unveiled SRI 1.0.0, a new milestone in their journey to decentralize and optimize bitcoin mining, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration. Some key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include: Miners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS. Miners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool. The implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests. This new version is the culmination of enhancements in the Stratum V2 specification achieved through collaboration within the working group and rigorous testing with the interoperability suite to ensure seamless compatibility between implementations of the Stratum V2 protocol. The release allows miners using SV1 or SV2 firmware to connect directly to an SV2 Pool or through a translation proxy. Miners can construct their block templates using a locally hosted Job Declaration Client and a patched version of Bitcoin Core Node, enabling them to send their templates to the Job Declarator Server operated by the SV2 Pool. Importantly, this update also allows independent third parties to run the node and JDC, expanding operational capabilities. The newly implemented pool fallback feature ensures miners maintain mining activity by automatically switching to alternative pools in the event a pool rejects their templates. This mechanism serves as a strong incentive for pools to act in the miners' best interests, ensuring miners' hash power remains secure and competitive. SRI's user-friendly pool setup and upcoming enhancements make it an attractive option for miners and pools seeking streamlined mining experiences. The project says it welcomes contributions and support from individuals and corporate entities interested in providing grants to help accelerate the development, research, and innovation in bitcoin mining technology.",

    "article_detailed_content": "The persistent disconnect between policymakers and technology invariably results in proposed and approved regulations overlooking pertinent parts of new technologies. US lawmakers and regulators face the challenge of regulating emerging technologies across blockchain and AI. Policymakers, like Senator Cynthia Lummis, have acknowledged the need for innovation in the financial sector and proposed legislation like the Digital Asset Innovation Act to address concerns. However, the SEC’s recent actions against Ripple Labs highlight the current “regulation-through-enforcement” approach, which critics argue stifles innovation. To be effective, they must become well-versed in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. As an example, public blockchain assets allow any person or entity to mine coins and tokens; there is a significant threat to the end consumer and national security if mining activity is unmonitored and unchecked. That said, the push has been to regulate blockchain under current regimes that, while exerting their best efforts, cannot create a framework to effectively address the real risks that could threaten our financial markets. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall are sponsors and supporters of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022, which would provide specific rules for crypto. The drawback is that the rules look like rules we currently have forced to fit blockchain technology. A 51% attack is a significant threat to national security, especially as more users enter the crypto market. Although the bill calls for certain entities to register as Money Services Businesses, it does not address blockchain as a global activity. The influence of USA regulation is significantly diminished outside of our borders. A possible solution would be to create a blockchain monitoring division of FinCEN. Policymakers often respond to public concerns. Because they are usually reacting, solutions are sometimes superficial at best and create rules without a nuanced understanding of the technology. This oversight results in attempts to fit crypto into existing regulatory frameworks, disregarding the complexities inherent in new technology. A proactive regulatory approach is likely the most effective for regulating blockchain technologies. Lawmakers and regulators should probably start with a task force that comprises industry leaders, consumers, miners, and keen regulators to determine the regulations, rules and laws that would be most effective. Major crypto players have looked to regulators for regulatory clarity to ensure consumer protection. Instead of providing comprehensive new frameworks, policymakers are wielding enforcement actions against the industry, as evidenced by SEC lawsuits and high-profile settlements against major crypto companies. This “regulation-through-enforcement” approach is fundamentally flawed; it creates adversaries, not allies, and stifles innovation that the government could leverage to improve itself. Uncertainties of the legal status of digital assets, as exemplified by ongoing cases like Hinman’s, hinder progress. Instead of relying on traditional lobbying efforts, policymakers must actively engage with the crypto community and industry professionals. The lack of defined precedents from unresolved court rulings in crypto cases is detrimental to both sides. While the judiciary should not legislate from the bench, well-formed opinions that discuss the court’s views on blockchain could benefit how legislators act. The absence of clarity on whether digital assets or investment products constitute securities hinders progress toward comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations. Compounding the challenge, many politicians continue to conflate the good and bad uses of blockchain technology. Indeed, some persist in associating crypto with illicit activities and other high-risk activities. Those positions foster doubt among the public and hinder individual participation in the crypto industry. Dispelling these misconceptions is crucial for fostering an accurate understanding of the crypto landscape. The aforementioned task force could be the solution. Crypto transactions are significantly more complicated to disguise than cash transactions. Contrary to popular belief, crypto transactions are not a covert haven for criminals. Crypto offers enhanced traceability, with a searchable, immutable record of every transaction. Understanding the significant differences between crypto and traditional banking transactions is pivotal for informed policymaking. Can be seen by a wider audience, Law enforcement can be crucial in leveraging blockchain intelligence to track activities on public blockchains and identify bad actors. A well-trained task force familiar with blockchain technology is a powerful deterrent against criminal activities. Policymakers face the ongoing challenge of adapting to the rapid pace of technological advancements. A proactive approach is essential to formulate effective regulations, necessitating connectivity with projects and significant players rather than relying solely on traditional lobbying efforts. The crypto community and industry professionals can contribute to a more informed policymaking process by forming trade groups and inviting policymakers to educational events. Bridging the knowledge gap is essential for creating regulations that facilitate innovation while ensuring security. Proposed actions for policymakers on building a secure and innovative crypto future Striking a balance between enhancing security measures in the crypto space and fostering innovation requires an informed approach. Policies should be designed to protect users while allowing the industry to flourish, primarily if the US aims to maintain global leadership in innovation. The realization of crypto’s full potential hinges on policymakers grasping its intricacies. It’s time to move beyond superficial approaches and embrace a more informed regulatory environment supporting innovation and security. The crypto community is prepared to engage in constructive dialogue, bridging the gap between technological advancements and effective regulation.

    "article_detailed_content": "Three blockchain advocacy groups have filed amicus curiae briefs on April 5 to defend Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm from criminal charges in the US. The filings support Storm’s motion to dismiss the charges against him and present several arguments to ensure developers are protected from such legal action. The Blockchain Association said the government’s case has a “critical flaw,” and its adoption could have “adverse repercussions” for the crypto industry. The group’s head of legal, Marisa Tashman Coppel, asserted that the government’s treatment of Tornado Cash as an unlicensed money transmitter is unfounded. Under 18 USC § 1960 & FinCEN regulations, money transmitters must have wholly independent control over user assets. She said: “Without the ability to independently move funds on a user’s behalf, one cannot be a money transmitter.” Tornado Cash and the developers do not have control over funds because the protocol is self-executing and immutable. Users instead maintain control over their assets, which are held in pools managed by non-custodial smart contracts. CoinCenter weighs in CoinCenter’s Director of Research, Peter Van Valkenburg, said the US government “wrongly charged the Tornado Cash developers with criminal conspiracy.” Like the Blockchain Association, Valkenburg and CoinCenter minimized developers’ role in Tornado Cash’s operations by referring to the platform’s smart contract-based pools. Valkenburg also explained how Tornado Cash’s software tools and UI are non-essential, meaning that the defendants did not execute transactions, comingle assets, receive funds, or provide secret notes — even if the platform was used for those purposes. He compared Tornado Cash to TurboTax, which provides users with a useful way to do taxes but cannot file and pay taxes on their behalf. CoinCenter also advanced legal arguments supporting software publication as free speech and supporting statutory exemptions for informational transactions. It compared Tornado Cash to SWIFT, stating that both platforms should be free from direct sanctions because each only handles information. DeFi Education Fund The DeFi Education Fund argued that developers should not be held responsible when a third party uses their software for criminal activity. The group’s Chief Legal Officer, Amanda Tuminelli, explained that the US government has never used a particular statute, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), in a comparable way. In over 100 other recent cases surveyed by the DeFi Education Fund, the government accused the defendant of interacting with a sanctioned counterparty. However, developers of platforms like Tornado Cash do not have any such counterparties. Motion to dismiss Storm and his lawyers initially filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges on March 29. The amicus curiae filings from each advocacy group explicitly support that motion. It is not yet clear whether the motion for dismissal will succeed, as the case is still in its early proceedings. The US Department of Justice charged Roman Storm in August 2023, and he will remain on bail until his September trial. The US Department also charged another Tornado Cash developer, Roman Semenov, alongside Storm. Semenov’s location is unknown. The US Treasury and OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, alleging that the platform has laundered over $7 billion of crypto since 2019. It linked a fraction of that activity to the North Korean state-sponsored group Lazarus Group.

The regulator emphasized that the verdict holds both parties accountable for a “massive crypto fraud” that caused “devastating losses for investors” and resulted in the destruction of $40 billion worth of market value “overnight.” The SEC has yet to obtain penalties or injunctions against Terraform Labs. In a statement to Reuters, a Terraform spokesperson rejected the verdict and the very premise of the lawsuit, stating the SEC “does not have the legal authority to bring this case.” In a separate statement to Bloomberg, the company said it plans to appeal the ruling. Kwon awaiting extradition For Kwon, the jury verdict only establishes civil liability, not criminal guilt. He faces separate criminal charges in the US and South Korea for his role in the Terra’s collapse. A federal judge postponed the SEC civil trial from January to late March to allow Kwon to attend the trial. However, the Terra co-founder’s extradition from Montenegro remains undecided. The country’s Supreme Court recently blocked the process again and sent it back for reevaluation. Both the US and South Korea are vying for Kwon’s extradition, with Montenegro previously ruling in favor of both countries before the process was blocked multiple times. SEC case Terraform Labs’ TerraUSD stablecoin collapsed in May 2022. Apart from the overnight losses mentioned by Grewal, TerraUSD’s key role in the crypto lending market led to a broader liquidity crisis. The post-TerraUSD market crash extended over the following months, as Bitcoin prices fell from $35,000 in May to less than $20,000 in November. The SEC obtained a subpoena against Terraform Labs during the crisis in June 2022 but did not file its complaint until February 2023. Before the latest verdict, a December 2023 ruling found that Kwon and Terraform Labs violated the Securities Act 1933.

    "article_detailed_content": "FTX creditors have strongly disapproved of the bankrupt crypto exchange’s decision to sell its Solana holdings at a significant discount to crypto venture firms. Earlier today, reports revealed that FTX offloaded as much as 30 million SOL at a rate of $64 each to VC firms like Pantera Capital and Galaxy Trading. The move is a substantial 62% markdown from the current market price — hovering around $176 as of press time. The SOL will be locked for four years and cannot be sold. The transaction, expected to fetch FTX about $1.9 billion, is positioned as a significant step towards repaying its creditors. However, those affected by the exchange’s collapse perceive the deal negatively. Sunil Kavuri, one of the victims, lamented that the sale “destroyed billions of value for FTX creditors,” accusing the firm’s bankruptcy lawyers Sullivan & Cromwell of prioritizing their clients over the creditors by disposing of what he deems is creditors’ “property.” Kavuri’s critique resonates with others impacted by FTX’s downfall, who have raised concerns over the exchange’s recurrent liquidation of customers’ digital assets within the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. FTX continues divesting digital assets On-chain data further reveals that addresses associated with FTX and Alameda have transferred approximately $15 million worth of crypto to centralized exchanges. According to Peckshield, these transactions include 1,000 ETH to Coinbase, 1,000 Wrapped Ether (WETH) to Wintermute, and 3,544 Wrapped Binance Coin (WBNB) to Binance. Notably, during the week, addresses of the failed exchange moved around $105.9 million worth of 19 different altcoins to two intermediary wallets. Subsequently, approximately $16 million in 13 different assets were deposited to centralized exchanges. Blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain reported that GateChain’s 3.17 million GT tokens, valued at about $31.3 million, dominated the transactions. Additionally, 3.37 million LEO tokens worth $20.4 million and 16.9 million VIC tokens worth $16.7 million were transferred. The remaining $37.6 million was distributed among 16 other little-known digital assets. The post FTX discount sale of $1.9 billion locked Solana faces creditor fury appeared first on CryptoSlate.",

    "article_detailed_content": "MadFi, a developer team focused on blockchain innovations, has secured a $1 million angel funding round for its BONSAI token — a memecoin on the Lens Protocol, according to an April 5 announcement. The investment propels the total market cap of BONSAI to nearly $100 million on a fully diluted basis. The token’s integration into the Lens Protocol since its launch on March 4 has marked it as a significant tool for content creators to monetize and engage communities within the digital economy. Several leading figures and organizations in the crypto and venture capital sectors participated in this round, including Palm Tree Crew (PTC) Crypto, Avara Ventures, and Social Graph Ventures. Additional investors included Friends with Benefits, Refraction, Boys Club Inc., Fire Eyes, Robert Leshner, Spencer Noon, and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal — indicating broad support for BONSAI’s potential to innovate content monetization on blockchain networks. Brett Shear of PTC Crypto praised the memecoin for achieving over 80% of paid mints on the Lens Protocol, highlighting the token’s role in enhancing user acquisition and engagement across its application ecosystem. MadFi co-founder and CEO Carlos Beltran said the goal is to make BONSAI the default currency on Lens. He emphasized the token’s role in rewarding content creation and engagement as key to its rapid adoption and success. With a 310.58% increase in value within a month and creators earning over $3 million in BONSAI, the token has demonstrated robust utility as a monetary and rewards layer on Lens. It has surpassed wMATIC as the preferred currency for monetizable content, capturing about 77% of Lens’ collected publications market share in March. The MadFi team, leveraging its experience since the launch of the Lens Protocol, continues to promote values such as content ownership, social graph portability, and on-chain social actions.+ MadFi aims to redefine content creation and consumption through BONSAI in an effort to offer creators fair compensation and foster a community that rewards engagement and brings value to the ecosystem.

    "article_detailed_content": "The intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence has become significant in the first quarter of 2024. We’ve seen Crypto-AI projects go from relative obscurity to digital notoriety (at least on X). Astronomical price actions have followed, with select projects multiplying in value far beyond expectations. Glamorous technology and cryptocurrency events, such as Nvidia’s GTC conference, have packed out rooms to hear more about these converging revolutions. Everyone wants a piece of the action. We’ve taken the time to sift through dozens of these AI-Crypto hybrid projects and peer beyond the hype, the fud, and the pumps, to get to the most important factor of all – the underlying technology. Here’s who we believe is leading the AI Crypto narrative in 2024, and who we are convinced, when the dust settles, will prove to be merited market leaders. 1. YOUR AI ($YOURAI) YOUR AI is an AI-driven Web3 content layer leveraging BRC-20 inscriptions to provide creators with real records of their contributions to e-commerce stores, while allowing them to retain full ownership of their content. AI is then tasked with distributing the content, using state-of-the-art algorithms. This might sound a little complex, but it’s essentially a way of giving more power to content creators who are regularly taken advantage of by powerful brands with unfair reward schemes. YOUR AI recently broke the DAO Maker for most $DAO staked pre-ido, and went on to hit a 53x multiple on launch! YOUR AI’s concept embodies the self-ownership and empowerment values of Web3 and has been received with ovations – the recent presale saw over 5,000 users embrace one of their dApps almost immediately. This hybrid AI-Blockchain platform’s early success will prove to be nothing short of disruptive for the e-commerce industry. Recently, YOUR AI got accepted into the Microsoft Startup Founders Hub! Through the Founders Hub, they’ll have access to tailored support from seasoned engineers, empowering their e-commerce offerings with personalised content, tailored precisely to meet the needs of their customers. For stores, YOUR AI solves big blockers too. They want access to user-generated content and to collaborate with content creators, but doing so can be complicated. YOUR AI facilitates a process that works for everyone, incentivizing creativity from brands and creators, while letting stores use best-fit content to engage their clients and push sales. Better information, more value generation, and bigger rewards, all thanks to AI-driven content. The $YOURAI token neatly weaves the ecosystem and its functionalities together: Staking: The utility token must be staked for access to content features, with users receiving a healthy yield in exchange. Buybacks: To ensure stability and growth for the token’s price, the team has designed a continuous buyback cycle, where their Content Distribution dApps buy $YOURAI tokens for streaming content, and Content Creation dApps use them for content storage and management. Voting: Governance is also offered by holding $YOURAI, which grants voting power in the YOUR AI DAO and allows the users to be involved, make decisions, and shape the project’s future. Could YOUR AI be Crypto-AI’s e-commerce frontrunner in 2024? We think so. 2. AIOZ AIOZ has been doing an impressive amount of development work recently, enabling them to tap into many different conversations as they scale their impressive AI-Crypto ecosystem. The overarching idea of AIOZ is to be a Decentralized AI Computing Ecosystem. What does that mean for anyone interacting with it? Well, it’s a space to train AI models, store datasets, build dApps, and monetize their contributions to AI. At the blockchain layer, AIOZ is designed for Web3 builders who want one-click dApp integration and support for smart languages across Ethereum and Cosmos. For AIOZ to run, it needs thousands of individuals around the world to offer their spare computing resources to power the network and its Web3, AI, storage, and media streaming applications. These people and their hardware are the nodes, running a “Decentralized Content Delivery Network”, or dCDN for short. Becoming a node is as simple as downloading software to your computer, and already over 80,000 people have done it. Nodes earn rewards in AIOZ for every data packet and can choose to offer their hard drive space, network card & bandwidth, or CPU & GPU. If all of that isn’t impressive enough, one of the early backers is Jimmy Donaldson, better known as Mr Beast. The world-famous YouTuber may agree that AI and the Blockchain will play an important role in video streaming. Also involved in the project is Bruce Pon, founder of Ocean Protocol, which we will cover. 3. Fetch.AI ($FET) Fetch has been key to driving the AI-Crypto narrative, largely because of how much recent press and attention it has received. The core concept is that it allows users to create intelligent autonomous decentralized agents that can do all kinds of automated tasks on your behalf. It is one of those projects that makes you question the real limitations of crypto, AI, and machine learning (or whether there are any). Major companies like Bosch and Datarella have already employed Fetch’s services, while the startup recently raised $15m for further development. Another reason that Fetch and its “Autonomous Economic Agents” (AEAs) can lead the narrative in this space is because of how well-designed and accessible the platform is. This could well be the place where we see the smart AI autonomous economy built. 4. SingularityNET ($AGIX) SingularityNET is a decentralized AI marketplace that leads the discussion surrounding democratized access to AI services. The cryptocurrency element is that all AI services must be purchased with the $AGIX cryptocurrency. Developers are invited and empowered to upload their own AI tools and algorithms to earn AGIX from sales to others. This business model essentially means anyone can access AI technology, if they have AGIX to spend, or monetize their algorithms if they’ve written some. Impressively, SingularityNET has already partnered up with IBM (whose Watson computer system was the first usable AI engine ever), and the United Nations (which is pretty powerful, when it wants to be). At the time of writing, there are already more than 50 services available, making this arguably the biggest AI algorithm network in the world. 5. Ocean Protocol ($OCEAN) Last, but by no means least, we have the Ethereum-based Ocean Protocol. It aims to lead the discussion about improving the quality of decentralized data, which currently lags behind centralized data. Tapping into the fact that decentralized data offers more control, Ocean provides a marketplace for data sharing that is built on AI. They’ve already raised over $20m in funding and have partnered with Aviva and Roche. Ocean aims to level the playing field for data and AI, with cryptocurrency helping to facilitate the mission. By clawing power away from Big Tech’s richest names, Ocean allows anyone to contribute to this pioneering industry and its astonishing rise. An Unexpected Revelation in Crypto-AI! Remarkably, whilst writing this article, SingularityNET, Fetch.AI, and Ocean Protocol announced a stunning cryptocurrency merger! The new AI mega-project will be called Artificial SuperIntelligence Alliance, with the proposed $ASI token boasting a $7.5bn FDV from launch. While the dust settles on this extraordinary news, we can expect this merger to be a challenge to rivals NEAR Protocol, and also to the rising influence of big tech in AI. YOUR and AIOZ will continue on their respective missions too, leading distinct narratives as the year progresses.

    "article_detailed_content": "An appellate court has revived a civil lawsuit against Coinbase due to a clerical error despite ruling that the initial dismissal was appropriate. The current ruling largely supported a federal court’s dismissal of the case, noting that the district court “properly dismissed” the plaintiffs’ Section 29(b) complaints. It also called the claims “repetitive conclusory allegations.” Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal responded to the legal development on April 5, saying that crypto exchanges have no private liability for secondary trading of crypto tokens because “contracts matter.” In their earlier amended complaint against Coinbase, plaintiffs attempted to remove references to the company’s user agreement, undermining their claims against Coinbase under Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act. Lawsuit revived Although the appeals court affirmed many aspects of the dismissal, it revived the case because the district court, which was originally responsible for the case, made a date-related error. The district court relied on Coinbase’s December 2021 user agreement but erroneously referred to the December 2020 version when considering the plaintiffs’ allegations. The parties involved in the case agree that the court made the error. However, there is disagreement on whether the mistake is relevant. Coinbase argues that the December 2021 agreement was integral to the amended complaint, while plaintiffs argue that no version of the agreement is integral because they did not rely on any version of the contract to support their claims. Plaintiffs initially claimed in 2021 that Coinbase’s sale or solicitation of 79 digital assets constituted illegal contracts because the company failed to register with the SEC.

    "article_detailed_content": "The Supreme Court of Montenegro has overturned earlier rulings regarding the extradition of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon and has ordered a new review of the case on April 5. The decision calls for the High Court in Podgorica to re-examine the extradition requests it previously addressed in an expedited manner. The Supreme Court’s decision comes after it found procedural errors in how the lower courts had handled the complex extradition case, which involves multiple countries seeking Kwon’s extradition. Extradition blocked again The Supreme Court ruled that lower courts had failed to properly assess the legality of each extradition request on an individual basis, a step highlighted as essential before the Minister of Justice can make an extradition decision. The new ruling emphasizes the necessity of thorough legal evaluation in extradition cases, especially when multiple jurisdictions are involved. The court clarified that the Minister of Justice, not the courts, has the authority to decide on extraditions based on a comprehensive review of the legal conditions met by each requesting country. Notably, the extradition proceedings have now been blocked several times. Initially, Kwon was set to be extradited to the US based on the government’s evaluation. However, the appeals court blocked the move and sent the matter to the High Court, which eventually decided to extradite him to South Korea because the country had made the extradition request first. The process has once again been blocked by the Supreme Court, with the final decision-making power given to the Ministry of Justice, which previously decided to extradite Kwon to the US. It is unclear whether the Ministry will make the same decision following the High Court’s reevaluation. International crypto fugitive Kwon became a controversial figure after the 2022 collapse of LUNA erased about $40 billion in market value. The incident led to accusations of fraud and initiated legal actions against him across various countries, with both the US and South Korea seeking his extradition to face trial. The international pursuit of Kwon underlines the growing regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry and raises questions about jurisdictional challenges in prosecuting alleged digital finance crimes. His arrest in Montenegro on charges including the use of forged identification documents added another layer to his ongoing legal challenges. As the High Court in Podgorica prepares to revisit the extradition requests, this case continues to attract global attention, reflecting broader issues of legal jurisdiction, regulatory oversight, and the complexities of international law in the digital economy.

Based on CryptoSlate research, an intriguing pattern has been observed in the lead-up to this halving event, potentially holding implications for the broader digital assets market. In the months preceding the previous BCH halving in April 2020, BCH experienced a remarkable price appreciation of around 130%. However, BCH dipped just before the previous halving in April 2020. It took roughly six months for Bitcoin (BTC) to lead BCH after its halving, which occurred in May 2020. Ahead of its halving on April 4, BCH has surged by approximately 150%. Interestingly, Bitcoin has also seen unprecedented growth and reached a new all-time high in the last month weeks before its halving. This raises the question: could the BCH price surge before its halving be a harbinger of a similar rally for Bitcoin?

    "article_detailed_content": "SushiSwap’s head chef, Jared Grey, said the ongoing controversy surrounding the protocol’s proposed transition to a Labs model is primarily driven by “former contributors who like to propagate endless FUD and misinformation.” The controversial proposal On March 26, a proposal titled Evolving Sushi—Burū no Shinka was submitted to allow Sushi to adopt a Labs model to restructure its current organization, enhance operational efficiency, and accelerate protocol development. The proposal pointed out that the protocol’s current governance procedures needed more flexibility to increase its development pace. Consequently, it proposed Sushi Labs as an autonomous administrative, technical, and operational company, or group of companies, tasked with product development and management within the Sushi ecosystem. However, the proposal has generated heated remarks from some in the community due to several proposed changes, including making the Sushi Labs more powerful and limiting the DAO’s powers to decentralized on-chain governance, such as voting on token allocations. Additionally, the proposal will allocate 25 million Sushi tokens and other funds to the Labs while making it the sole beneficiary of future airdrops. This move has been heavily scrutinized, mainly because the amount in the treasury differs from what the proposal states. The treasury wallet appears to contain 168 ETH, 13 million SUSHI, and 88,900 USDC. However, the proposal mentioned 1,228 ETH, 33.55 WBTC, and 1.574 million DAI, which are not in the treasury address. Interestingly, Naïm Boubziz, a former contributor to SushiSwap, alleged that the Sushi Labs team might be manipulating the voting by adding liquidity to vote for themselves and removing the liquidity. He said: “SushiSwap’s latest move is THE real hostile take over. They’ve introduced a new snapshot, sidelining the DAO and seizing the entire treasury without consulting the community.” These dramas have led some community members to label the proposal “End of DAO.” Grey replied, stating, “Labeling it as the “End of DAO” seems melodramatic when many view it as a needed upgrade, reducing the friction and inefficiencies plaguing Sushi’s less organized DAO model compared to its contemporaries and the need to deploy a more decentralized structure. Still, you’re entitled to your opinion, and sharing is encouraged.” SushiSwap team response In his response, Grey said that successfully implementing the Burū No Shinka will lead to a new era of streamlined governance for the Sushi DAO. According to him, the DAO will no longer require a head chef figurehead, and his role will transition to leading Sushi Labs’ product development. He added: “Sushi Labs’ goal is to foster the advent of a multi-product-and-token ecosystem, unlocking new opportunities for utility, governance, and value creation, which will remain under the control of the governance council structure, with increased on-chain and decentralized controls. We view this as a win-win for Sushi DAO.” Grey also debunked claims that the team was manipulating the votes, revealing that a whale purchased a substantial amount of the SUSHI token to disrupt every effort of progress by the Sushi team.

    "article_summary": "The recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the SEC sent jitters through the financial world. Initial concerns about fading demand seem unfounded as Bitcoin ETFs continue to shatter trading volume records. This is further bolstered by three consecutive sessions of net inflows into these investment vehicles. Related Reading: Solana Primed For Takeoff? Expert Analysis Points To Buying Opportunity Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Long-Term Investor Appetite A recent dip in ETF activity sparked fears that the initial excitement might be short-lived. However, those fears have been quelled by a resurgence in inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, yesterday saw a net inflow of $203 million into Bitcoin spot ETFs, marking the third straight day of positive inflow. This sustained green streak suggests that investors remain interested in gaining exposure to the top crypto through ETFs, potentially anticipating a price surge due to the upcoming Bitcoin halving – a pre-programmed code update that cuts production in half, historically leading to price increases. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Leads The Pack BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has emerged as a frontrunner in the crypto ETF space. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded the highest net inflow on a single day, exceeding $144 million. BTC market cap currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com This impressive figure has pushed IBIT’s total net inflow over the past two weeks to over $14 billion. BlackRock’s commitment to Bitcoin ETFs is further underscored by their recent decision to include prominent Wall Street institutions like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Citadel Securities, and UBS as Authorized Participants (APs) in their spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus. These additions position these banking giants as first-time participants in the ETF market, joining established players like JPMorgan and Jane Street. The inclusion of such heavyweights is seen as a significant vote of confidence in the future of Bitcoin ETFs and a potential catalyst for further mainstream adoption. Volatility On The Horizon For ETFs While the recent surge in demand paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin ETFs, experts warn that volatility may be lurking on the horizon.

    "article_summary": "Generally, the crypto market has been experiencing a pullback after Bitcoin and many other coins like Ethereum have recorded a new all-time high of which Arbitrum (ARB) was not left behind. Arbitrum, which has a lot of potential with a market cap of over $3.8 billion and a circulating supply of 2,653,939,384 ARB has been trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) for some time now. However, recently the price of ARB has been showing some signs of reversing. As of the time of writing, Arbitrum was trading around $1.45, indicating an increase of 1% in the last 24 hours. There are currently two major resistance levels of $1.799 and $2.278 ahead of the price. Technical Indicators Show Signs Of Upward Movement In Arbitrum Price 4-hour RSI Indicator: Looking at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator from the 4-hour timeframe, we can see that the RSI line is rising above the oversold zone and is heading toward the 50 level. This indicates a rise in the price, and if the RSI line rises above the 50 level, it might trigger the start of a new trend. The image below reveals more: 4-hour MACD: looking at the formation of the MACD indicator from the 4-hour timeframe in the above image, we can also see that both the MACD line and the signal line having trended for a while below the MACD zero line have both crossed and are heading towards the MACD zero line. On the other hand, the MACD histogram is already trending above the MACD zero line. This suggests that a change in direction might soon happen from its downward movement to an upward movement. 1-hour bull power vs bear power histogram indicator: lastly, taking a good look at the chart from the 1-hour time frame with the help of the bull power vs bear power indicator, it shows that the histograms are already trending above the zero level. This suggests that buyers are gradually taking over the market from sellers as seen in the image below. In conclusion, if the price of Arbitrum manages to change its direction from downward to upward direction, it is possible that ARB could retest its previous major resistance levels of $1.799 and $2.278 and even move further to create a new peak. Nonetheless, if Arbitrum fails to move upward, the crypto asset’s price might move further downward to create a new low. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from Tradingview.com",

    "article_summary": "The Cardano price has been facing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past week, declining by more than 12%. This recent fall coincides with a broader crypto market downturn, with other major altcoins suffering huge losses over the past week. Specifically, Cardano’s price decline has been largely linked to the recent sell-off of all ADA holdings by the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC). On Thursday, April 4, the fund disclosed its decision to rebalance its portfolio by liquidating its Cardano assets (about 1.6% of the entire holdings). Registering such a negative start to April after an underwhelming performance in March doesn’t do well to dispel the increasing concerns of investors. Moreover, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Cardano price might continue to succumb to the bearish pressure. Analyst Predicts ADA Price Slump As Whale Activity Slows Down Popular crypto pundit Ali Martinez has shared a post on X that Cardano whales have been making fewer moves in the market in recent days. This revelation is based on Santiment’s Whale Transaction Count metric, which tracks the number of ADA transactions worth more than $1 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Go On 1.2 Million BTC Buying Spree, Is Retail Finally Here? Whales refer to entities or individuals that own significant amounts of a particular cryptocurrency (Cardano, in this case). They are often viewed as key players in the market, as their buying or selling activities can have a significant impact on the Cardano price, leading to speculation and potential market shifts. According to Martinez, the on-chain data shows that there has been a noticeable dip in the activity of Cardano whales, suggesting a possible decline in significant ADA transactions. In an almost vertical move, the whale transaction count dropped from around 400 daily transactions at the beginning of last week to 200 daily transactions by Friday, April 5. Chart showing ADA whale transaction count, whale holdings, and price | Source: Ali_charts/X The crypto analyst mentioned that the recent downturn in whale activity could be a signal for “further price consolidation” or an imminent decline in the Cardano price. A loss of substantial buying activity from large investors can cause the cryptocurrency to succumb to bearish pressure, especially from small traders looking to take some profit. Indeed, the Cardano token has made a positive start to the year, reaching a high of $0.8 in early March. However, the altcoin has been on a downward trend since hitting the 2024 peak – collapsing under the pressure of Bitcoin’s price decline.

Santiment reported that these whales, which represent holders of 100-100,000 BTC, purchased a total of 319,310 BTC (valued at $21.6 billion) in the last three months. This report also stated that a significant portion of the newly acquired tokens came from retail traders, i.e., holders of 0-100 BTC, who collectively offloaded 105,260 BTC, valued at $7.2 billion and 0.7% of BTC’s circulating supply, within the same time frame. 🐳↗️ #Bitcoin‘s key stakeholders with 100-100K $BTC have ACCUMULATED a collective 319,310 $BTC (around 1.4% of the supply) in the past 3 months.

For context, the Bitcoin halving, which occurs every four years, is a network-programmed event during which the amount of miners’ rewards on the Bitcoin blockchain is reduced by half. Generally, the Bitcoin halving is regarded as a positive event that results in asset scarcity, thus driving up demand and market price in the long term. This notion may just remain true as Santiment describes the increased accumulation by BTC whales heading into the final weeks before the next halving as a bullish signal, indicating high confidence in the asset’s future valuation.

    "article_summary": "Cardano (ADA)’s founder is a man of many words and many GIFs. Charles Hoskinson’s comments, whether you agree or disagree with them, tend to spark discussions in the crypto community. Hoskinson’s latest X reply spree covered issues from dating advice to his confidence in the ecosystem to Solana’s recent struggles. As a result, several conversations regarding those topics and Cardano’s founder’s perspectives on them spread across the X platform. Related Reading: Cardano Price Tumbles As Grayscale Sells All ADA From Large Cap Fund Charles Hoskinson’s Dating Advice Charles Hoskinson offered some crypto-related dating advice in a reply to Lily Brodi, the creator of the viral ‘Cardano Girls’ video. The content creator asked whether it was weird to ask someone on the first day if they held ADA. Cardano’s founder replied that not holding ADA was a “major red flag” at this point. Hoskinson jokingly insinuated that the person might “not be a cannibal,” but if they don’t hold Cardano’s native token, you should be alert anyway. At this point, not holding ada is a major red flag. I mean I'm not saying they are cannibals, but… pic.twitter.com/s2CzXr2Hxr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 4, 2024 Later, he suggested he might know one or two eligible “Cardano bachelors.” The community found Hoskinson’s comments funny, with some agreeing with his perspective on potential partners. Nonetheless, not all Hoskinson’s replies during his Wednesday spree were well received. Cardano’s founder seemingly took a jab at Solana after learning of the blockchain’s recent struggle to process transactions. The post informed us of the levels of congestion that the Solana network is experiencing. According to Dune data, the Solana blockchain currently has a non-vote transaction failure rate of over 75%. Three out of four transactions are experiencing issues before even making it to the block. The failure rate seems to occur “because many bots engaging in arbitrage generate spam transactions.” To the news, Hoskinson replied with a popular gif of actor Pedro Pascal enjoying himself. This guy is exactly why Cardano ngmi Cardano has a douchebag founder https://t.co/Xn0Dj1VDsG — LawrenceOfCrypto.sol (@LawrenceCrypt0) April 5, 2024 This reply prompted some X users to criticize Cardano’s Founder. Some even called him a “douchebag founder” and claimed that answers like that are the reason why the project “won’t make it.” However, the ADA community joined in the criticism of the Solana network. Some community members deemed the chain as “useless.” Another ADA holder stated: “The Solana team does not know the basic principles of how blockchain works.” The comments don’t come as a surprise as both communities’ ongoing “feud” tends to end in a jab and poking fun at each other’s struggles. “Cardano Always Wins” Or Does It? As part of Hoskinson’s recent “insight,” he commented on a recent poll ranking the best Layer-1 networks. In said poll, the Cardano ecosystem had the second-highest number of voters. Nonetheless, its founder didn’t seem pleased, claiming that “It was engineered to produce an outcome prior to a single vote being cast.” To Hoskinson, in a “fair vote,” it is clear that “Cardano always wins.” Despite his confidence in the project, the ADA price has recently shown a subpar performance. The token has exhibited red numbers in several timeframes, with an 11.5% drop in the last seven days and a 20.5% decrease in the past month. The token’s current performance has not gone unnoticed by analysts either. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez raised some concerns about ADA’s whale activity. According to Martinez, “Cardano is experiencing a lull in whale activity.” The analyst considers that this could signal a potential for further price consolidation or an impending drop. The unclear trajectory of ADA’s price seems concerning to its holders, as some consider its current performance to be “extremely bearish right now.” At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.5748, a level not seen since Valentine’s Day.

Hoskinson’s latest X reply spree covered issues from dating advice to his confidence in the ecosystem to Solana’s recent struggles. As a result, several conversations regarding those topics and Cardano’s founder’s perspectives on them spread across the X platform. Charles Hoskinson’s Dating Advice Charles Hoskinson offered some crypto-related dating advice in a reply to Lily Brodi, the creator of the viral ‘Cardano Girls’ video. The content creator asked whether it was weird to ask someone on the first day if they held ADA. Cardano’s founder replied that not holding ADA was a “major red flag” at this point. Hoskinson jokingly insinuated that the person might “not be a cannibal,” but if they don’t hold Cardano’s native token, you should be alert anyway. At this point, not holding ada is a major red flag. I mean I'm not saying they are cannibals, but… pic.twitter.com/s2CzXr2Hxr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) April 4, 2024 Later, he suggested he might know one or two eligible “Cardano bachelors.” The community found Hoskinson’s comments funny, with some agreeing with his perspective on potential partners. Nonetheless, not all Hoskinson’s replies during his Wednesday spree were well received. Cardano’s founder seemingly took a jab at Solana after learning of the blockchain’s recent struggle to process transactions. The post informed us of the levels of congestion that the Solana network is experiencing. According to Dune data, the Solana blockchain currently has a non-vote transaction failure rate of over 75%. Three out of four transactions are experiencing issues before even making it to the block. The failure rate seems to occur “because many bots engaging in arbitrage generate spam transactions.” To the news, Hoskinson replied with a popular gif of actor Pedro Pascal enjoying himself. This guy is exactly why Cardano ngmi Cardano has a douchebag founder https://t.co/Xn0Dj1VDsG — LawrenceOfCrypto.sol (@LawrenceCrypt0) April 5, 2024 This reply prompted some X users to criticize Cardano’s Founder. Some even called him a “douchebag founder” and claimed that answers like that are the reason why the project “won’t make it.” However, the ADA community joined in the criticism of the Solana network. Some community members deemed the chain as “useless.” Another ADA holder stated: “The Solana team does not know the basic principles of how blockchain works.” The comments don’t come as a surprise as both communities’ ongoing “feud” tends to end in a jab and poking fun at each other’s struggles. “Cardano Always Wins” Or Does It? As part of Hoskinson’s recent “insight,” he commented on a recent poll ranking the best Layer-1 networks. In said poll, the Cardano ecosystem had the second-highest number of voters. Nonetheless, its founder didn’t seem pleased, claiming that “It was engineered to produce an outcome prior to a single vote being cast.” To Hoskinson, in a “fair vote,” it is clear that “Cardano always wins.” Despite his confidence in the project, the ADA price has recently shown a subpar performance. The token has exhibited red numbers in several timeframes, with an 11.5% drop in the last seven days and a 20.5% decrease in the past month. The token’s current performance has not gone unnoticed by analysts either. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez raised some concerns about ADA’s whale activity. According to Martinez, “Cardano is experiencing a lull in whale activity.” The analyst considers that this could signal a potential for further price consolidation or an impending drop. The unclear trajectory of ADA’s price seems concerning to its holders, as some consider its current performance to be “extremely bearish right now.” At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.5748, a level not seen since Valentine’s Day.",

A Large Amount Of Dogecoin Has Left The Binance Platform In The Past Day According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large transfer has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain during the past day. In this move, the network has processed the movement of 304,588,737 DOGE, worth around $52.3 million when the transaction was executed. Given the large scale of the transfer, it’s likely that a whale entity was involved. The whales are influential on the network due to the sheer number of tokens they carry in their wallets. As such, their moves can be worth keeping an eye on since they may cause noticeable fluctuations in the market.

Naturally, it’s impossible to say what an investor plans to do confidently. The type of addresses involved in the transaction, however, can sometimes at least provide a hint about what the whale may have wanted to achieve with the move. Below are the details of the latest Dogecoin whale transaction, which reveals its relevant addresses. Looks like this massive move only required a negligible fee of $0.03 to be possible on the Dogecoin blockchain | Source: Whale Alert As is visible, this Dogecoin transaction was executed from a wallet connected to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The destination of the move appears to have been a couple of unknown addresses. An unknown address refers to a wallet not affiliated with any centralized entity like an exchange (the sender in this transfer is a “known” wallet as it’s attached to a central entity in Binance). Generally, such addresses are the investors’ personal, self-custodial wallets. Transfers where coins move in the direction of exchanges to self-custodial entities are known as “exchange outflows.” Usually, investors make such moves when they plan to hold onto their coins long-term, as it’s safer to do so outside of these platforms, where the platforms control the wallets. Exchange outflows can also sometimes be an indication that fresh buying is going on, as some investors like to immediately withdraw their purchases of these platforms.

    "article_summary": "The recent ratio between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices suggests a potential decline in risk appetite within the crypto market. The ratio has reached its highest level since April 2021, indicating a stronger demand for Bitcoin than its smaller rival, Ethereum. This development has led crypto asset trading firm QCP Capital to speculate that this shift in the ratio could be an early indication of a transition from “fear of missing out” (FOMO) to outright fear. Bitcoin And Ethereum Performance Regarding recent market trends, the second quarter of 2024 has begun with relatively subdued activity. Bitcoin’s price has dipped below the $70,000 mark and has remained range-bound between $65,000 and $68,000 for the past few days despite briefly touching the $70,000 mark on Monday. Related Reading: XRP To $20 And Ethereum To $20,000: Crypto Analyst Reveals When This Will Happen According to QCP’s analysis, the inflow of funds into the spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) market has not been substantial enough to drive significant price movements in either direction. As a result, the company has observed that funding rates have stabilized, and the front end of the forward curve has declined from previous highs of 50% to less than 20% currently. Interestingly, while the front end of the forward curve has decreased, the back end remains elevated. This has led to interest in rolling spot-forward basis positions further out, potentially driven by the continued demand for long-dated Bitcoin calls extending into 2025. On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance has been relatively weak. QCP also notes that the ETHBTC ratio cross-tests a critical support level after breaking below 0.05. Notably, there has been sustained selling of Ethereum calls, resulting in lower volatility and downward pressure on the price. Ultimately, QCP finds that these developments are prompting speculation as to whether this could be an early sign of FOMO turning into fear, particularly about Ethereum’s role as a proxy for altcoins. While Bitcoin may find support from topside demand and ETF inflows, Ethereum’s performance and its impact on altcoins will be important factors to watch closely. Will BTC Experience A Double-Top? Renowned crypto analyst Crypto Con has raised an intriguing question about whether BTC is poised for a double top similar to the patterns observed in 2013 and 2021. Analyzing previous market cycles, Crypto Con highlights that more evident double tops, such as those witnessed in the first and third cycles of 2021, triggered significant initial surges on the Fisher Transform indicator. In contrast, the 2017 double-top formation showed a more subtle initial rise in June. Notably, all final cycle tops ended with a regular bearish divergence, where the price reached higher levels while the indicator declined, as seen in the chart below.

Crypto Con suggests that if the Fisher Transform indicator can consolidate around these levels without spiking to the line seen in 2013 and 2021, it could indicate a higher likelihood of a single top formation, which is the analyst’s most likely outcome, for December 2024, marking the top of this cycle.

Notably, the Halving is a pre-programmed event built into the Bitcoin protocol that occurs approximately every four years within the Bitcoin network to reduce the reward for mining new BTC blocks. Despite Bitcoin’s recent consolidation, anticipation for a potential rally above the $70,000 mark continues to build within the crypto community, especially as the halving is now less than 20 days away. This is because the halving ultimately decreases the supply of new BTC, and reduced supply often leads to increased demand and speculative buying. Hope For Bitcoin Bull Run Jelle’s analysis underscores the historical precedent of Bitcoin’s price movements, noting that previous all-time highs were often preceded by periods of consolidation and uncertainty.

    "article_summary": "In a significant development, FTX bankruptcy trustees have reportedly sold about two-thirds of a $2.6 billion stash of Solana (SOL) at a “deeply discounted price.” Industry figures such as Galaxy Trading and Pantera Capital were among the investors involved in the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, as reported by Bloomberg. SOL Tokens’ Four-Year Journey Per the report, the FTX estate was able to sell between 25 million and 30 million locked-up Solana coins at $64 each, generating up to $1.9 billion in proceeds for the estate. Under Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Galaxy Trading managed to raise approximately $620 million for a fund established to purchase SOL from the FTX estate. According to the report, investors in the vehicle will be subject to a 1% management fee, and the investment will offer a yield through staking. Related Reading: Dogecoin Deflates: What’s Behind The 20% Price Drop Amidst Memecoin Mania? It is worth noting that the 41 million Solana tokens sold by the FTX estate are locked according to a pre-agreed vesting period, preventing them from being available for trading on the market. According to Bloomberg, these tokens will gradually become available for sale over the course of four years, which could significantly impact SOL’s price action. However, as the tokens remain locked, SOL’s 739% year-to-date (YTD) uptrend remains intact, and the possibility for further gains remains in the cards. Solana Sale Garners Interest From Prominent Figures FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison, was a major supporter of SOL. As previously reported, Bankman-Fried has actively engaged with guards at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where he is currently incarcerated. He offers investment advice and recommends SOL as a potential opportunity, demonstrating his bullish sentiment on the protocol. The token, which operates on the Solana blockchain, constituted a significant portion of the digital assets stranded on the collapsed exchange, creating shockwaves throughout the crypto markets. In addition to Galaxy Digital, Bloomberg notes that selling SOL tokens has attracted the attention of Pantera Capital. This $5.2 billion asset manager has reportedly raised capital for a special fund to acquire up to $250 million of SOL from the FTX estate. Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets Corp. also announced the purchase of 26,964 SOL tokens for $1.7 million on March 27. However, FTX creditors are concerned they will be under-compensated in the SOL sale process. Creditors Dispute FTX Bankruptcy Ruling In January, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case ruled that the amount of each claim should be based on what the customer or creditor was owed on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. At that time, SOL was trading at about $16, well below its current market price. As the price of SOL rallied in recent months, this discrepancy became a point of contention for some creditors. One creditor, Sunil Kavuri, expressed during Bankman-Fried’s final sentencing hearing that the SOL coins are “our property.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts ADA Price Crash To $0.34, Why Is Cardano Founder Bullish? Another creditor, whose name was redacted in court documents, stated in a written statement that the FTX estate is “giving away money for free to hedge funds.” In a recent interview, Bankman-Fried claimed the following regarding clients’ growing concerns about underpayment: I’ve heard and seen the despair, frustration, and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full, at current price. That could and should have happened in November 2022, and it could and should happen today. It’s excruciating to see them waiting, day after day. Currently, the price of SOL stands at $175, reflecting a decrease of up to 6.7% within the last 24 hours and over 7% over the past week. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

The token, which operates on the Solana blockchain, constituted a significant portion of the digital assets stranded on the collapsed exchange, creating shockwaves throughout the crypto markets. In addition to Galaxy Digital, Bloomberg notes that selling SOL tokens has attracted the attention of Pantera Capital. This $5.2 billion asset manager has reportedly raised capital for a special fund to acquire up to $250 million of SOL from the FTX estate. Vancouver-based Neptune Digital Assets Corp. also announced the purchase of 26,964 SOL tokens for $1.7 million on March 27. However, FTX creditors are concerned they will be under-compensated in the SOL sale process. Creditors Dispute FTX Bankruptcy Ruling In January, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy case ruled that the amount of each claim should be based on what the customer or creditor was owed on the day FTX filed for bankruptcy. At that time, SOL was trading at about $16, well below its current market price. As the price of SOL rallied in recent months, this discrepancy became a point of contention for some creditors. One creditor, Sunil Kavuri, expressed during Bankman-Fried’s final sentencing hearing that the SOL coins are “our property.” Another creditor, whose name was redacted in court documents, stated in a written statement that the FTX estate is “giving away money for free to hedge funds.” In a recent interview, Bankman-Fried claimed the following regarding clients’ growing concerns about underpayment: I’ve heard and seen the despair, frustration, and sense of betrayal from thousands of customers; they deserve to be paid in full, at current price. That could and should have happened in November 2022, and it could and should happen today. It’s excruciating to see them waiting, day after day. Currently, the price of SOL stands at $175, reflecting a decrease of up to 6.7% within the last 24 hours and over 7% over the past week. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

Nevertheless, there is still a lot of steam left in the cryptocurrency it seems, as crypto analysts have identified both a bottom and a 7-year cycle that could send its price as high as $40. Dogecoin To Bottom Around $0.16 In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Trader Mayne posited that Dogecoin could find a bottom around $0.16.

The cycle ends in 2028 and by this time, the crypto analyst expects that the DOGE price will move above $2, then $9, and all the way to $40. They support this with the fact that the DOGE price moved from $0.0007 in 2017, and reached as high as $0.7 in 2021. Given this, the analyst advises crypto investors not to miss the Dogecoin move up.

    "article_detailed_content": "Uniswap, the pioneering decentralized exchange (DEX), has cemented its position as the leader in the crypto trading sphere by surpassing a staggering $2 trillion in all-time trading volume. This achievement, reached on April 5th, signifies a major milestone for the platform, highlighting its remarkable growth trajectory since its launch in November 2018. Data compiled by Zach Wong, Uniswap’s strategy and operations lead, reveals the DEX’s impressive trading volume figures. The $2 trillion mark was achieved on April 5th, with a significant contribution coming from transactions across various blockchains supported by Uniswap, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. This multi-chain compatibility is believed to be a key driver of Uniswap’s widespread adoption. Expecting Uniswap Protocol to hit $2T in all-time volume in the next 24 hours So we’re doing a thing The first person to refresh our countdown Dune query to show 2T all-time volume gets 200 USDC How to participate — Uniswap Labs (@Uniswap) April 4, 2024 Uniswap: 42 Months To Hit 1st Trillion Uniswap’s journey to this milestone has been remarkable. It took 42 months to reach the first trillion in trading volume in May 2022. However, the subsequent growth has been exponential, showcasing accelerating user activity and solidifying Uniswap’s dominance in the DEX market. Data from a Dune Analytics dashboard maintained by Uniswap co-founder Fredrik Haga indicates Uniswap’s weekly trading volume at nearly $22 billion, more than double its closest competitor, PancakeSwap. This achievement wasn’t met with silence. Anticipating the milestone, Uniswap Labs actively engaged the community. They announced the impending $2 trillion mark on April 4th and even incentivized participation by offering a $200 USD Coin (USDC) reward to the first person who captured a video clip showcasing the moment Uniswap’s trading volume crossed the threshold. Opportunities And Challenges Ahead The success of Uniswap can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its focus on innovation has been instrumental. The platform leverages smart contracts to facilitate automated digital asset exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a permissionless and transparent trading experience. Secondly, Uniswap’s multi-chain compatibility expands its reach, catering to users across various blockchain ecosystems. Finally, fostering a strong community seems to be another key ingredient. The $2 trillion milestone celebration reward exemplifies Uniswap’s commitment to engaging its user base. However, the future of DEXs like Uniswap holds both opportunities and challenges. While DEXs offer advantages like decentralization and censorship resistance, they can also face hurdles related to user experience, security, and potential regulatory interventions. How Uniswap navigates these challenges and adapts its platform will be crucial in maintaining its leading position. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView",

    "article_detailed_content": "The Shiba Inu ecosystem has recorded yet another noteworthy milestone with its recent listing on a leading cryptocurrency and digital asset platform. This latest development comes at a time when interest and demand for SHIB have been growing rapidly, further increasing the prospects for an adoption boost in the cryptocurrency. Shiba Inu Gets Listed On Nexo On March 5, crypto-based financial service firm, Nexo officially announced the listing of Shiba Inu’s native token, SHIB on its platform. The crypto firm had revealed this monumental development via X (formerly Twitter), informing investors and traders within the crypto community that SHIB was now live on Nexo. Nexo unveiled a list of exciting features accompanying the new SHIB listing, prioritizing an enhanced user experience for crypto community members. Among these features, users will be able to easily purchase Shiba Inu tokens using their bank cards, leveraging the platform’s instant transactions to buy tokens within seconds. Additionally, Nexo has disclosed that Shiba Inu investors can swap their tokens for rewards through its platform. The crypto firm highlighted the availability of Ethereum top-ups for any investor looking to purchase more ETH tokens. More interestingly, Nexo has provided loan options for SHIB traders and investors, emphasizing that users can borrow funds against SHIB to facilitate their trading and investing activities. Furthermore, the digital asset firm has offered users seamless crypto transfer services, underscoring that SHIB holders can make token transfers to their friends and family efficiently via their mobile phone numbers or email addresses. SHIB New Listing Opens Doors For Global Adoption With Shiba Inu now available on Nexo, crypto traders and investors can get easy access to the cryptocurrency in regions where the digital asset platform operates. This achievement can be viewed as a response to the doggy-themed meme coins’ growing demand and interest within the crypto space. Recently, Shiba Inu has been making waves, experiencing notable growth as its price fundamentals strengthen and its vibrant community expands. The cryptocurrency has successfully captured the attention of enthusiasts globally, earning the distinction of being among the top most searched meme coins on Google. By leveraging Nexo’s user-friendly interface and robust infrastructure, Shiba Inu can boost its adoption rate, extending its services to users in fresh markets and jurisdictions. This move will bring Shiba Inu closer to mainstream recognition, potentially enhancing the token’s visibility and liquidity and possibly triggering a significant rally that could drive the price of the cryptocurrency upwards.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Scams and hacks have been some of the most significant issues affecting the crypto industry over the past few years. As a result, the space has seen the birth of several blockchain investigators striving to ensure the digital asset space is safe for everyone to go about their business with ease and confidence. ZachXBT, one of these popular on-chain sleuths on the X platform, has come forward with an interesting revelation about his recent encounters with a certain law enforcement agency in the United States. The investigator disclosed that he has been “borderline harassed” by this agency in the last few months. Authorities Seek Help From On-Chain Sleuth On Friday, April 5, ZachXBT revealed – via a post on X – that he has been repeatedly harassed by agents of the Criminal Investigation (CI) unit of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The on-chain detective accused these individuals of a “blatant disregard for professionalism” in the process of asking for his assistance on blockchain investigations on multiple occasions. ZachXBT said in his post: They have shown up irl (in real life) to old addresses, contacted personal emails using private data, and have sent mail when I have public contact methods readily available. In one of the shared images, ZachXBT showed an email from an IRS-CI special agent asking for the crypto investigator’s assistance on new digital asset cases. The IRS-CI special agent went on to praise the blockchain sleuth for doing some “really impressive work” to ensure the safety of the crypto space. Furthermore, ZachXBT reiterated his commitment to helping victims of scams by providing the necessary documentation to law enforcement agencies. However, the on-chain investigator mentioned his unwillingness to do so once his boundaries and privacy were breached. ZachXBT Refuses To Help In Crypto-Related Crimes It appears that a “blatant disregard for any professionalism” is not the only reason ZachXBT would decline to offer his expertise in blockchain crime cases. Recently, the crypto detective refused to help holders of Complex (SIMPLE), a meme coin project that was shut down a few days after its launch on the Base network. ZachXBT explained in a post on X: I simply dislike spending long periods helping people who willingly choose to gamble on vaporware meme coins vs. actual victims. According to a statement on April 4, the meme coin’s developers shut down the Complex project due to recent instances of harassment, citing its impact on the mental well-being of their members. As of press time, the SIMPLE coin has lost almost all of its value, with a market cap of less than $80,000.",

    "article_detailed_content": "According to a Friday report by Bloomberg, a United States jury found Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon liable for civil fraud over the crash of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. This development comes as Do Kwon continues to battle criminal cases in the US and South Korea over the sudden collapse of the popular crypto project, which resulted in a $40 billion loss of investor assets. SEC Wins Liability Suit Against Terraform Labs In February 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto scam involving the sale of multiple digital assets, especially LUNA and the algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD (UST). Based on Bloomberg’s latest report, a seven-man jury in New York has now deemed the defendants liable for fraud in this government case, thus providing the SEC with a boost in its ongoing crackdown on the digital asset industry. While the trial lasted for two weeks, the jury deliberations on Friday revealed that Do Kwon and Terraform Lab purported that Chai, a prominent South Korean payment processing platform, was a user of the Terra blockchain network. Furthermore, the jury also concluded that the defendants deceived investors on the stability of the UST stablecoin, whose de-peg from the US Dollar was a critical event in the Terra ecosystem collapse. Commenting on this development, the SEC’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, reiterated the agency’s desire for a cryptocurrency legal, and regulatory framework. Grewal said: As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance. Following the conclusions of the New York Jury, the SEC has now won claims of liability against Kwon and Terraform. Thereafter, the securities watchdog is now seeking a court order on civil penalties against the defendants and the recovery of ill-gotten gains and payment of prejudgment interests. Montenegrin Apex Court Reverses Do Kwon’s Extradition Order In other news, the Supreme Court of Montenegro has overturned the extradition order of Do Kwon to South Korea by a lower court. This development came following a petition by the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office of the Balkan nation which highlighted a breach of authority and procedural violations in the rejection of an appeal from Kwon’s legal team by an appellate court. Following deliberations, the Montenegrin Apex Court has now ruled in favor of the Prosecutor’s Office and ordered a reevaluation of the extradition requests of the US and South Korea for the popular crypto figure. Do Kwon was arrested in March 2023 by local Montenegrin authorities for traveling with falsified documents. Since then, the “highly wanted” Terraform co-founder has been the subject of an extradition contest between both countries who are pressing criminal charges over the crash of the Terra blockchain project.",

    "article_detailed_content": "In recent times, the increasing appeal of Bitcoin (BTC) among asset managers and traditional finance (TradFi) institutions has gained significant attention, particularly with the notable success of Bitcoin ETF products offered by industry leaders like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity. This success has prompted more Wall Street banking institutions to eagerly enter the newly approved ETF market as authorized participants (AP). Major Institutions Join BlackRock As per recently disclosed notes, BlackRock has expanded the list of authorized participants for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF. BlackRock’s addition of five new participants, including Goldman Sachs, Citadel, Citigroup, UBS, and clearing house ABN AMRO, brings the total number of authorized participants to nine. This move comes as the fund attracts substantial investments from individuals and institutions. It is worth noting that Jane Street Capital, JPMorgan, Macquarie, and Virtu Americas were already on the authorized participant list. According to BlackRock’s filing, the authorized participants will exclusively transact in cash to create and redeem ETF shares. They will not directly or indirectly handle Bitcoin as part of the creation or redemption process. Authorized Participants play a critical role in the ETF ecosystem. They have agreements with ETF issuers that give them the right to create and redeem ETF shares in response to market demand. These participants may act on their behalf or that of other market participants and are not compensated by ETF issuers. By dynamically adjusting the number of ETF shares outstanding, authorized participants aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs for ETF investors. Wall Street Giants Embrace Bitcoin ETF Market Adding high-profile Wall Street institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, UBS, and Citadel to the Authorized Participants underscores the growing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin-related financial products. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas suggests that these banking giants either have a newfound interest in the sector or are now comfortable publicly associating with it. According to Balchunas, their participation was not previously explicitly mentioned in ETF filings. However, these ETFs’ remarkable growth and success have likely influenced their decision to participate openly. Regarding market flows, the ten Spot ETFs recently approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have shown steady investor interest. On April 4, these ETFs recorded a notable net inflow of $213 million, marking the third consecutive day of positive flows. However, Grayscale’s GBTC experienced a substantial net outflow of $79.3 million within a single day. The historical net outflow for GBTC has now reached $15.31 billion. On the other hand, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF emerged as the top performer, witnessing a significant net inflow of approximately $144 million on the same day. This brings IBIT’s total historical net inflow to $14.4 billion. BTC trades at $67,700, experiencing sideways price action over the past 24 hours and a 2% price decline over the past seven days despite the Bitcoin ETF market’s success.

    "article_detailed_content": "Recently, renowned trader Peter Brandt voiced criticism directed squarely at Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, denouncing it as a “junk coin” in a blunt assessment. Ethereum Faces Criticism Celebrated for his insights into financial markets, Peter Brandt spared no punches as he castigated Ethereum, arguing that it lacks the essential characteristics required for long-term success. His remarks underscored ETH’s perceived weaknesses as a store of value and its struggles with layer-2 solutions and high gas fees, factors he believes contribute to its inferiority compared to Bitcoin. To support his assertions, Brandt posted an Ethereum/Bitcoin price chart and his criticism of ETH, showing the asset’s consistent decline relative to Bitcoin in the past year. I get tired of saying it, but $ETH is a junk coin despite mindless devotion of Etheridiots. As a store of value it is junk – a $BTC pretender Its functionality is also junk – difficult to deal with L2s and outrageous gas fees Of course it will always attract “investors” pic.twitter.com/7KAYMiwsnf — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) April 4, 2024 While Brandt was dishing out his critique on ETH, other voices presented contrasting perspectives on Ethereum’s prospects. In a notable defense of the asset, JP Morgan’s Global Markets Strategy team recently unveiled reasons Ethereum may not be classified as a security, highlighting shifts in the network’s staking ecosystem towards greater decentralization. This transition, evidenced by the decline in Lido’s share of staked ETH, is seen as a positive development that could assuage regulatory concerns and “bolster” Ethereum’s case against a security designation. JP Morgan’s analysis draws attention to the pivotal “Hinman documents,” which have shaped the SEC’s approach to digital tokens. These documents emphasize the importance of network decentralization in determining whether tokens qualify as securities, suggesting that tokens on sufficiently decentralized networks may be exempt. Community Reaction To Brandt’s Critique Interestingly, Brandt’s criticism of ETH sparked a diverse range of reactions within the community. While some stood behind Brandt’s assessment, others vehemently opposed it and came to Ethereum’s defense. Among those supporting Brandt’s critique was Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. Back weighed in, highlighting Ethereum’s vulnerability to significant hacks, scams, and rug-pulls, which have amounted to over $1 billion per quarter. He underscored the growing complexity of Ethereum’s scripting, emphasizing how increased complexity often leads to security vulnerabilities. don’t forget the > $1bi per quarterl hacks, “hacks” and rug-pulls on it’s seemingly unsecurable script, which is just getting worse over time, because complexity kills; and the eths in charge just continue adding complexity… — Adam Back (@adam3us) April 5, 2024 Meanwhile, another X user named Collin offered a contrasting perspective. Collin pointed out Brandt’s criticism seemed “biased” and failed to “acknowledge ETH’s unique capabilities beyond Bitcoin.” He argued that Ethereum’s programmability sets it apart, allowing for features and functionalities that Bitcoin cannot replicate. Collin added: And yes, ETH’s fees are high. But Ethereum is doing *more* than bitcoin is doing per block. Also, BTC’s fees have been crazy high in the past ($50+ per transaction), and they *will* go up again (by intentional design) in the future. So, if high fees are your complaint, you may want to take a good hard look at Bitcoin’s future security roadmap. High fees are baked in. Big time. You should continue your research on this, Peter.

    "article_detailed_content": "On-chain data on April 5 shows that the Cardano Treasury is rapidly growing even as ADA prices struggle to shake off determined sellers. Currently, the treasury holds over 1.48 billion ADA worth over $843 million at spot rates. If adoption projections are anything to go by, the figure could exponentially increase in the coming months, possibly propping up ADA prices. Cardano Treasury Rising: Bullish For Development The Cardano Treasury exists by design. It serves as a war chest to fund ongoing development. A fixed amount of ADA is set aside per epoch—that is when a block of transactions is confirmed—and sent to the treasury. Every epoch is completed roughly after five days. Besides ADA accumulation from reserves, the treasury reserves a portion of funds from transaction fees. The more Cardano finds adoption and hosts decentralized applications (dapps) like decentralized exchanges (DEXes), the more the treasury goes. With ADA from every epoch and transaction fees, Cardano gets sufficient funds to continue development. This arrangement is critical considering that Input-Output Global (IOG) is actively pushing new updates to make the network more performant and reliable. Currently, in the Basho stage, the objective is to improve performance, allowing the network to host intensive dapps and compete with Ethereum and Solana. Already, Cardano is finding favor, especially from governments. Apart from liaising with the government of Ethiopia to enhance education by leveraging the blockchain, agencies in the United States and Europe are also looking at Cardano. Will Rumored Partnership Drive ADA Higher? Rumors suggest that various states in the United States have approached Cardano developers about developing a transparent blockchain voting platform. Though discussions are said to be underway, key details remain out of public reach. Even so, there are blockchains of choice other than Cardano. Options like Solana or Ethereum can be solid alternatives. One of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock, issued a tokenized fund on Ethereum, seeding it with $100 million. Whether the community will accept partnership deals as bullish remains to be seen. Presently, ADA is under pressure, dropping 30% from March highs. Despite attempts for higher highs on April 4, sellers flew back today, wiping out gains. Any breakout below $0.55 might accelerate the dump towards $0.45, wiping out Q1 2024 gains. Even with the bearish outlook, some analysts are bullish. After a period of sluggishness, the 2-week chart is flashing green, mirroring the green wave seen at the beginning of the 2020 bull run.",

    "article_detailed_content": "Dogecoin has been stuck in a price correction since March 31, falling by 21% from $0.2214. This has seen DOGE falling across a number of metrics, including the MVRV ratio. The MVRV ratio recently turned negative, a condition that indicates many holders are currently at a loss. This might sound bad, but it could actually be a massive buy opportunity for long-term investors of the meme cryptocurrency. Dogecoin MVRV Ratio Turns Negative: Why Does This Matter? Data has shown DOGE falling to the negative side of its MVRV ratio. According to price data provided by Santiment, an on-chain analytics company, DOGE’s MVRV ratio fell quickly to a low of 15.36% on April 4. The MVRV ratio compares an asset’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization, giving insight into investor sentiment and the potential for price rallies. For DOGE, it divides Dogecoin’s current market cap by the realized value of all the coins in the market. At the time of writing, Dogecoin has a market cap of $24.9 billion. Although still the largest of all meme coins, Dogecoin’s market cap has fallen by almost 20% in the past seven days. When the ratio turns negative, it often means investor sentiment has soured, and selling pressure is prevailing. However, it also indicates DOGE is trading at a discount relative to historical investment costs. For long-term investors, this can present a chance to buy DOGE at a price below its average realized price. On the other hand, very high positive DOGE MVRV ratios have often led to significant price pullbacks. In the past, these periods of negative MVRV were followed by significant price rallies. Consequently, past action has seen DOGE go on a price recovery shortly after falling from the -5% to -15% range. The last time DOGE fell to -15% on the MVRV ratio was during a 31% price drop, which lasted from March 14 to March 20. During this period, the meme currency reached a value of $0.1251. However, the meme coin reversed course just shortly after and went on a 78% price surge over seven days to reach $0.2262 on March 28. What’s Next For DOGE? At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1738. Recent price action has seen the meme coin navigating a tight zone and a massive selling spree from whales. DOGE is now trading just above a support zone just above $0.17. A break of this price level to the downside could mean DOGE falling to as low as $0.125 again in the short term. On the other hand, the end of the current market consolidation could reignite interest in DOGE and buying volume. As a result, the price could easily retest the $0.22 level.",

    "article_detailed_content": "On April 5, a Manhattan jury found Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon, liable on civil fraud charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, Terraform Labs, the entity behind the failed algorithmic UST stablecoin, has hinted that it could appeal the judgment. Why Do Kwon Was Found Guilty According to the verdict, Terraform Labs and Do Kwon misled investors regarding the stability of the algorithmic stablecoin UST. The jury also found that they falsely claimed that Chai, a Korean payment system, utilized its technology. Gurbir Grewal, the SEC Director of Enforcement, highlighted the significant losses suffered by investors due to Terra’s deception. He further urged the crypto companies to prioritize compliance and investors’ protection. “We are pleased with today’s jury verdict holding Terraform Labs and Do Kwon liable for a massive crypto fraud. Terraform Labs and Kwon, its former CEO, deceived investors about the stability of the crypto asset security and so-called algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD… Through these deceptions, the defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight,” Grewal remarked. However, Terraform Labs said it was “disappointed with the verdict” because it does “not believe the evidence supports it.” “We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps,” Terraform Labs added. This verdict highlights the strides taken to scrutinize the crypto market. It could also have far-reaching implications, shaping future regulatory approaches and investor confidence. For Do Kwon, the recent jury verdict establishes civil liability. Notably, the former Terraform Labs CEO is simultaneously facing separate criminal charges in the US and South Korea for his involvement in Terra’s LUNA collapse. Read more: Digital Currency Group Downfall: What Went Wrong With the VC Giant Over the past months, Kwon’s extradition proceedings have hit repeated roadblocks in Montenegro. Initially slated for the US, Kwon’s fate took a turn when the appeals court intervened. The case landed in the High Court’s lap, which ultimately greenlit his extradition to South Korea, the first country to request it. However, the Supreme Court has halted the process, and the Ministry of Justice now has the final authority. Do Kwon’s final destination remains in the air, and his case continues to attract global attention.

The post FTX Sold 30 Million Solana (SOL) Tokens at a 60% Discount appeared first on BeInCrypto.",
    "article_detailed_content": "FTX’s administrators have sold a significant portion of its Solana (SOL) assets, fetching nearly $1.9 billion. This transaction saw between 25 million and 30 million SOL tokens, part of a larger $2.6 billion cache, being sold at a 60% discount, for $64 each. The sale’s timing is critical, considering SOL’s current market price hovered around $172. It indicates a hefty concession but promising a potentially lucrative return for the buyers. 30 Million Solana (SOL) Tokens Sold The sale attracted notable firms from Galaxy Trading to Pantera Capital. Therefore, it showcased the deep interest and potential confidence in Solana’s future. This strategic divestment is part of FTX’s dissolution process, initiated after its infamous collapse in November 2022. The deal’s scale and the significant discount highlight the risk appetite of institutional investors in a market known for its volatility. Solana, in particular, has experienced dramatic price swings, dropping by as much as 97% in past bear markets. Observers like Eva Weng, from Caladan, remarked on the unique nature of the transaction. She pointed out that investors are essentially trading immediate liquidity for the chance to buy at significantly reduced prices, with a four-year lock-up period on their capital. “Basically you’re exchanging time for a discount — you have to lock up your capital for four years, but you get to pay much less for the tokens,” Weng said. Read more: 6 Best Platforms To Buy Solana (SOL) in 2024 The narrative around Solana, and its significant role in FTX’s asset portfolio, has been further complicated by the legal troubles of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried. His heavy investment in Solana turned sour as FTX collapsed, leading to his conviction and a 25-year prison sentence. This backdrop adds a layer of intrigue to the sale, as Solana was among the most affected by FTX’s collapse.

What does this mean for RNDR's future direction? Uncover insights and predictions. The post Render Network (RNDR) Price Dilemma: Investor Confidence vs. Whale Caution appeared first on BeInCrypto.",
    "article_detailed_content": "The Render Network (RNDR) price trends are unfolding a nuanced narrative. On one hand, an increase in the average coin age signals bolstered confidence among holders, hinting at a bullish outlook. On the other hand, the halt in whale accumulation since late March suggests a more cautious stance, as some investors pause their investments. At this juncture, RNDR is at a crossroads, with its future direction—a bullish surge or a bearish downturn—resting on the developing market trend strength. Increased RNDR Holder Confidence Over the past week, the Mean Coin Age (MCA) for Render, which measures the average duration that coins are held or remain unspent, has notably risen. Indeed, there has been a discernible increase in MCA, climbing from 350 on March 27 to 356 by April 4. This shift suggests a prevailing inclination among investors to hold their assets longer, possibly forecasting price increases. RNDR Mean Coin Age. Source: Santiment Despite the rising MCA, the expansion in the number of addresses holding substantial RNDR amounts has leveled off in the last week. This change in whale behavior may signal a consolidation phase for Render Network, where the market reaches a balance between buying and selling pressures.

RNDR Price Prediction: Crossroads Currently, RNDR finds itself without clear support or resistance in its vicinity, according to the IOMAP chart. This tool highlights key investor activity zones, indicating potential support and resistance based on investment density. The IOMAP points to significant support at $7.63, suggesting this as a fallback level in case of a downtrend. Conversely, for an uptrend, RNDR faces a notable resistance at $9.79, marking a potential target before encountering heavy selling pressure. RNDR IOMAP.

    "article_summary": "JPMorgan projects confidence in SEC's approval for Ethereum ETFs, citing improved decentralization and reduced network concentration as key factors, amidst varying analyst sentiments. The post JPMorgan Is Bullish on Ethereum ETF Approval appeared first on BeInCrypto.",
    "article_detailed_content": "JPMorgan has projected a confident stance regarding the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) eventual green light for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite earlier this year giving a no more than 50% chance for approval by May, optimism persists within the firm. Ethereum ETF Approval Odds Improve Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director and global market strategist at JPMorgan, expressed that a delay beyond May could trigger a litigation process akin to previous legal battles involving Grayscale. He anticipates the SEC could face a defeat in such litigation. This could pave the way for the eventual approval of Ethereum ETFs, albeit at a later timeline. “If there is no spot Ethereum ETF approval in May, then we assume there is going to be a litigation process after May,” Panigirtzoglou stated. This optimistic outlook persists even amid reports of the SEC scrutinizing the Ethereum Foundation and efforts to classify Ethereum as a security. However, easing centralization concerns, notably the declining market share of Lido Finance, enhance ETH’s prospects of sidestepping the security designation. JPMorgan’s team underscores network decentralization as a critical factor, drawing from the SEC’s Hinman documents. “The share of Lido in staked ETH has decreased further from around one third a year ago to around a quarter at the moment. This should reduce concerns about concentration in the Ethereum network, thus raising the chance that Ethereum will avoid being designated as security in the future,” Panigirtzoglou said. Contrastingly, the sentiment is not universally accepted. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted a decline in his optimism. He adjusted his odds for Ethereum ETF approval to 25% from an initial 70% in January.

Yet, the narrative from this juncture could take a positive turn, buoyed by investor confidence that remains steadfast. Pepe Investors Hold Steady Despite a 26% drop recently, Pepe’s outlook appears geared towards recovery, driven by investor optimism. This sentiment is captured by the transition of tokens from short-term to mid-term holders, indicating a deeper commitment to holding onto their investments for potential future gains. Currently, an impressive 36 trillion PEPE, valued at over $232 million, has transitioned from the hands of short-term investors—who typically hold for less than 30 days—to mid-term holders, who retain their assets for one month to a year.

While this might hint at a continued downtrend, on-chain metrics paint a more optimistic picture.

BlackRock Adds Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Others, to Spot Bitcoin ETF Authorized Participants",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker BlackRock Adds Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Others, to Spot Bitcoin ETF Authorized Participants BlackRock Inc. has increased its list of Authorized Participants (APs) for its IBIT spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A new filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adds five new Authorized Participants to its existing list, pushing the total to nine. New BlackRock Authorized Participants to Help Improve IBIT Liquidity The new APs include Citadel Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, ABN AMRO Clearing USA LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., and UBS Securities LLC. These five join existing APs like JP Morgan Securities LLC, Jane Street Capital, Virtu Americas LLC, and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. According to the filing, the Sponsor, iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, may add more APs anytime. An AP is a financial institution responsible for creating and redeeming ETF shares. These entities, usually banks, are responsible for most of the ETF’s liquidity, ensuring a healthy amount by holding the ETF’s underlying assets. They use a creation and redemption mechanism that creates more shares when there is a market shortage or reduces shares in circulation where necessary. Adding multiple APs is expected to increase liquidity for BlackRock’s ETF shares. Also, including major institutions like UBS, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, point to traditional interest in Bitcoin. It may also indicate a growing trust these institutions have in regulated products that allow traditional players to comfortably enter the Bitcoin or crypto sector. BlackRock is Gaining on the Crypto Sector BlackRock’s IBIT ETF has had a stellar performance since trading began in January. According to Blockworks’ Bitcoin ETF Tracker, IBIT’s Assets Under Management (AUM) is at $17.24 billion, with a 24-hour volume of $268 million as of writing time. IBIT’s AUM is only second to Grayscale’s GBTC, with $24.33 billion in AUM and a 24-hour volume of $90.7 million. Despite waiving its management fee and consequently recording a daily record inflow of $119 million, VanEck’s ETF is still struggling and only has $38.2 million in AUM, and a 24-hour volume of $1.6 million. Interestingly, VanEck believes interest in a spot Ether (ETH) ETF may be larger than interest in Bitcoin’s. According to VanEck Portfolio Manager Pranav Kanade, “ETH could make more sense as an asset to more people than Bitcoin does.” Unfortunately, there are no hints about whether or not the SEC is willing to grant approval to would-be issuers of spot ETH ETFs. The Commission has repeatedly delayed deciding on multiple applications for the Ether ETF product. BlackRock recently took its success in the Bitcoin sector further when it launched the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), its first tokenized fund on a public blockchain. Via the Ethereum Network, BlackRock is using BUIDL to enable investments in several products, including repurchase agreements and Treasury bills. The giant asset manager launched BUIDL tokens pegged 1:1 to the dollar, for stability, and also to pay investors dollar yields. Within a week of the launch, the BUIDL fund received inflows of $160 million. next BlackRock Adds Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Others, to Spot Bitcoin ETF Authorized Participants",

    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker Australian Asset Manager Monochrome Gears to Launch Spot Bitcoin ETFs by July With the tremendous success of the spot Bitcoin ETF launch in the US markets in January 2024, asset managers worldwide are now working to bring the Bitcoin investment product to their home country. As per the latest reports, Australian asset manager Monochrome is looking to launch the flagship spot Bitcoin ETFs by July 2023, on the global listing exchange Cboe Australia. If approved, the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF would be Australia’s first Bitcoin fund to directly invest in BTC. So far, the regulators in Australia have green-lighted two exchange-traded products (ETPs) running on Cboe Australia with exposure to spot crypto assets. However, these ETPs do not hold Bitcoin directly, instead, they invest in investment products having exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs. For listing their spot Bitcoin ETFs in Australia, asset managers first need to get approval from the securities regulator before applying for the exchange listing. The good thing is that the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has already granted approval to Monochrome thereby expecting the Cboe to clear the application by June. The asset manager originally planned to introduce its spot Bitcoin ETF through ASX, a competitor of Cboe. However, Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management, revealed that opting for Cboe Australia as the listing venue for the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF better aligns with their strategic vision, market reach, and timeline. Yew added: “We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024. The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly.” Yew also explained the major difference between Monochrome spot Bitcoin ETF and existing ETPs while providing investors with a straightforward transparent path to BTC exposure. It is identical to “how spot Bitcoin ETFs are structured in the United States”. Spot Bitcoin ETF Demand The first two months witnessed solid demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US with BlackRock taking the largest share of the pie. so far, the nine spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded total inflows upwards of $12.4 billion. The successful debut of spot BTC ETFs in the US has spurred other nations to contemplate the feasibility of introducing comparable products in their respective markets. Other markets like Hong Kong are also exploring similar Bitcoin funds in their region. next Australian Asset Manager Monochrome Gears to Launch Spot Bitcoin ETFs by July",

South Korea to Introduce Stringent Guidelines for Crypto Exchange Listings in May",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker South Korea to Introduce Stringent Guidelines for Crypto Exchange Listings in May According to reports from local media outlet News1, the move is part of the country’s efforts to enhance transparency and security within its rapidly growing digital asset market. The upcoming guidelines, spearheaded by South Korean financial authorities, aim to fortify investor protection and uphold market integrity. The rules are slated for release by the end of April or early May. Once implemented, crypto exchanges within and outside the country will be obligated to comply with the guidelines. Under the new rules, South Korean-based crypto exchanges are restricted from listing tokens associated with projects that have been exploited in the past unless thorough investigations into the root causes and security resolutions are completed. The guidelines also propose stringent criteria for foreign crypto projects seeking listings on South Korean exchanges. According to the report, the law demands that these projects publish detailed whitepapers or technical manuals explicitly tailored for the South Korean market before being accepted to trade in the exchanges. However, exemptions may apply to tokens traded on licensed exchanges for over two years, sparing them from meeting the new stringent criteria. Authorities Can Order Exchanges to Delist Certain Cryptocurrencies The report also disclosed that under the new guidelines, authorities may decide to order exchanges to delist certain cryptocurrencies from their platforms if the token issuer fails to provide comprehensive information regarding the digital asset. Furthermore, the law allows the authorities to hold crypto exchanges accountable for ensuring accurate disclosure of essential information by token issuers. Failure to provide comprehensive information, including discrepancies between actual circulation figures and publicly disclosed amounts, may result in the tokens’ delisting from exchanges. South Korean financial authorities are currently seeking feedback from local exchanges to shape the new guidelines. As per the report, collaborative efforts between the country’s Financial Supervisory Services and stakeholders like the Digital Asset Exchange Association have been instrumental in refining the listing guidelines and fostering a robust regulatory framework. Meanwhile, South Korea has one of the busiest crypto markets in the Asia Pacific region. Upbit, the largest digital asset trading platform and people’s favorite, recorded a 24-hour trading volume of $15 billion on March 5, 2024. In July 2023, the company surpassed Coinbase and OKX in trading volume. The exchange experienced a 42.3% increase in spot trading, reaching a record high of $29.8 billion, while Coinbase and OKX saw their volumes decline by 11.6% and 5.75%, landing at $28.6 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. next South Korea to Introduce Stringent Guidelines for Crypto Exchange Listings in May",

For the bulls to regain control in the short term, they must gather sufficient momentum to overcome the resistance level at $0.0000075 and successfully confirm it as a support level through a retest. When Will PEPE Continue Its Bullish Rally as Bears Show No Sign of Slowing Down?",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker When Will PEPE Continue Its Bullish Rally as Bears Show No Sign of Slowing Down? The Ethereum-based memecoin, PEPE, has recently entered a phase of price consolidation. Following a bullish rally in late February and early March, the coin has encountered challenges in sustaining its upward momentum and has instead been trading sideways. In mid-March, PEPE reached its all-time high of $0.000011, marking a significant milestone for the memecoin as it showed the increasing interest and speculation surrounding digital assets of this nature. However, the euphoria was short-lived, as PEPE swiftly experienced a sharp decline of approximately 41% within a brief span of time. Critical Support Must Hold First Despite the efforts of bulls to stage a recovery from the price dip, persistent selling pressure from bears has caused the coin to decline by over 25% in the past five days. The price of PEPE has been trading around the critical support level of $0.0000064, a pivotal juncture that could dictate its short-term trajectory. If the selling pressure persists without respite, there is a possibility of breaching this support zone, potentially triggering a bearish trend. On the other hand, for the bulls to regain control in the short term, they must gather sufficient momentum to overcome the resistance level at $0.0000075 and successfully confirm it as a support level through a retest. Compounding PEPE’s challenges is the recent takeover by dogwifhat as third largest memecoins in market capitalization. As a result, PEPE has slipped to the fourth spot. Given that WIF continues to demonstrate strength without any apparent signs of slowing down, PEPE may find itself entrenched in this position for a considerable period or potentially slide further down the rankings. Another Glimmer of Hope for PEPE Interestingly, PEPE appears to be mirroring the trajectory of its mother coin, Ethereum (ETH). During the period when PEPE reached its all-time high, ETH was also on a notable bullish run, accompanied by a positive market sentiment for most major cryptocurrencies. However, while ETH is presently trading sideways, there are predictions that a successful breach of its nearest resistance levels and a subsequent continuation of its upward movement may have a ripple effect on PEPE. This could potentially result in PEPE re-entering a bearish downtrend. Despite the decline, some analysts remain optimistic, considering this time as an opportune moment to purchase the coin. They associate this opportunity with the upcoming Bitcoin halving, which is anticipated to impact the upward trajectory of altcoins. In a poll conducted by crypto analyst Davie Satoshi, assessing the potential for a tenfold increase in market capitalization compared to the present, PEPE emerged as the frontrunner, surpassing WOLF BRETT and ANDY with a commanding 57% of the votes. This achievement led Davie to bestow upon PEPE the title of the memecoin king, surpassing its competitors. It is clear $PEPE is king but many believe $ANDY (on Eth) can also 10x compare to the rest of the Boy's Club. pic.twitter.com/uokIoYX1GD — davie satoshi (@NFTdavie) April 5, 2024 Irrespective of individual perspectives, the recent price fluctuations of this frog-themed meme coin have garnered significant attention within the crypto community. Should the coin surpass its current resistance level and experience a breakout, it may set the stage for another bullish rally. next When Will PEPE Continue Its Bullish Rally as Bears Show No Sign of Slowing Down?",

Sony Bank to Conduct Stablecoin Trial on Polygon",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker Sony Bank to Conduct Stablecoin Trial on Polygon Sony Bank, one of the largest online banks in Japan and a subsidiary of Sony Group Corp (TYO: 6758) has reportedly started stablecoin issuance experimentation. Crucially, the bank said it plans to collaborate with SettleMint, a Belgium-based blockchain company to perform stablecoin trials on the Polygon blockchain. Sony Bank’s Trial with Stablecoin According to reports from local news media, Sony Bank’s stablecoin experimentation is tied to legal currencies such as the Japanese Yen. Through the trial, the company hopes to evaluate how businesses that use the Sony Group’s intellectual property, such as games and sports can utilize stablecoins as a payment option. Basically, stablecoin is a type of currency in which the digital asset’s value is tied to a reference asset, such as fiat money, exchange-traded commodities, or another cryptocurrency. These digital assets are becoming quite popular as they attempt to tackle concerns over price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to other more stable assets, usually fiat currencies. As regards Sony’s stablecoin trial, anticipated to span over the next couple of months, the bank said it will investigate any legal issues related to transferring Yen-backed stablecoins. Moreover, Sony hopes to benefit from cheaper fees for individuals when transmitting money and making payments. Sony’s attempt to perform its stablecoin trial on Polygon’s blockchain is significant as the network boasts a huge user base, thus allowing the firm to optimize the advancement and potency of the project. A key catalyst contributing to the growth of Polygon is the increased affordability it provides. In comparison with Ethereum, Polygon offers lower transaction fees, making it a popular blockchain network for developing DApps with a cost-effective user interface. Notably, Sony Group’s venture into blockchain technology didn’t begin with its stablecoin experimentation. Last year, Sony Network Communications allied with Astar Network to introduce a Web3 incubation program for projects that target the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Months after this move, Sony Network Communications went on to partner with Singapore-based Web3 infrastructure developer Startale Labs to create Sony’s indigenous blockchain network. Japan Welcomes Blockchain and Web3 Technology Japan is becoming increasingly recognized for its embracing of crypto acceptance, attracting a host of crypto enterprises to the nation. Last year, the country established a clear regulatory framework for the issuance and usage of stablecoins in the country. According to authorities, the amended law is expected to stimulate and advance the country’s adoption of the crypto industry as well as the Web3 ecosystem. Following recent crypto regulatory advancement in Japan, Circle Financial, one of the leading stablecoin issuers in the crypto industry partnered with SBI Holdings in November to expand its presence in Japan. Through this partnership, Circle stated at the time that it hoped to increase the adoption of its USDC stablecoin outside the United States. next Sony Bank to Conduct Stablecoin Trial on Polygon",

Philippines SEC Moves on eToro, Says Platform Offers Unregistered Securities",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker Philippines SEC Moves on eToro, Says Platform Offers Unregistered Securities eToro, an online trading platform, is the latest firm to find itself on the wrong side of the Philippines’ securities regulator. This follows after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the country accused the platform of selling or offering securities without obtaining the authorization to do so. Recall that the securities regulator had previously banned popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance from offering its services in the country. Now, however, it appears that the same fate may have just hit eToro. In an advisory that was issued in March but publicly published on April 4, the Philippines SEC told the public that eToro’s services are not legally permitted. The regulator noted that eToro is yet to register as a corporation in the Philippines. Hence, it lacks the required operational license as provided by the Securities Regulation Code. This means that the platform has no permission to sell securities, operate as a broker-dealer, or even run an exchange where securities can be traded. That is within the Philippines. Part of the advisory reads: “ETORO’s operations allow Filipinos to create user accounts on their platform for the purpose of investing and trading unregistered investment products.” Philippines Warns Residents About eToro, Issues Penalties eToro is undoubtedly a platform that resonates well with the younger generation. Founded in 2007, the multi-asset investment firm has over 33 million registered users worldwide, according to Statista. Despite its giant status and popularity, however, the Philippine finance regulator would not allow unregulated crypto business. The watchdog has advised Filipinos to tread with caution, particularly when dealing with unregistered online investment platforms such as eToro. To further signal its commitment to a fully regulated space, the SEC’s advisory also detailed a list of penalties for potential offenders. According to the bulletin, anyone acting as a representative, promoter, influencer, endorser, or salesperson for eToro in the Philippines is liable to penalties of up to $88,300 in fines. That is approximately 5 million Philippines pesos. There is also the possibility of a 21-year jail term for anyone caught doing any of the things mentioned above. What Next? For now, the SEC has only issued an advisory. However, expectations are that it would take it a step further by possibly blocking access to eToro’s website. Recall that the same events previously played out with Binance when the SEC issued a similar advisory in November 2023. However, it wasn’t until March that the regulator instructed the national internet provider to block access to Binance’s website. Interestingly, even as the Philippines continues to make a statement regarding its regulatory space, the eToro company website still lists the region as a supported country. next Philippines SEC Moves on eToro, Says Platform Offers Unregistered Securities",

Terraform Labs Trial Wraps with Jury Verdict, Faces Severe SEC Penalties and Sanctions",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker Terraform Labs Trial Wraps with Jury Verdict, Faces Severe SEC Penalties and Sanctions The climactic finale awaits in the civil fraud courtroom drama involving Terraform Labs and its visionary, Do Kwon. Following extensive witness testimonies and legal discourse, the opposing parties prepare to deliver their concluding statements today, April 5, 2024, in this captivating fraud trial. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed allegations against Terraform Labs, a Singaporean firm, and its founder, Do Kwon. The commission asserts that they misled investors regarding the stability of their algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), during the year 2021. TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin, employed a sophisticated mechanism alongside its sister token, Luna, to maintain a $1 peg. Investors were attracted by the promise of a stable asset coupled with high returns – a combination that ultimately led to fatal outcomes. The regulation commission asserts Terraform Labs and Do Kwon falsely depicted UST as a stablecoin, deceiving investors about integrations with widely-used Korean mobile payment platforms like Chai. According to officials, these false statements drew investors into a risky project by Teraform Labs. Terraform Labs and Do Kwon Counter SEC’s Allegations Terraform Labs and Do Kwon’s defence team has responded to the SEC’s allegations, contending that the regulatory agency misinterpreted statements and relied on biased witnesses potentially motivated by whistleblower rewards. They assert that the UST’s collapse was an unfortunate market occurrence, not the result of fraudulent actions. The detaching of UST from its peg affected more than just investors, losing an estimated $40 billion, according to SEC allegations. The crash triggered a domino effect throughout crypto markets, plummeting major token values like Bitcoin. Several crypto firms filed for bankruptcy in 2022 due to the Terra collapse. The SEC pursues monetary fines and industry restrictions for Kwon and Terraform Labs. However, the outcome of this legal action could impact future regulations within the rapidly evolving yet unstable cryptocurrency realm. An unfavorable ruling would establish a benchmark for subsequent oversight in this innovative financial space. The Kwon Conundrum Do Kwon, currently confronting extradition requisitions from both the United States and South Korea on criminal allegations, did not attend the judicial proceedings initiated on March 25, 2024. Kwon’s conspicuous absence adds another layer of mystery to this high-profile case. The jury’s verdict, expected in the coming days, will be closely watched by the cryptocurrency industry and investors alike. The outcome will not only determine the fate of Terraform Labs and Do Kwon but also potentially influence the future trajectory of cryptocurrency regulations. next Terraform Labs Trial Wraps with Jury Verdict, Faces Severe SEC Penalties and Sanctions",

    "article_summary": "Coinspeaker The Resurgence of Crypto Investments in Q1 2024 The first quarter of 2024 has marked a significant turning point for the crypto industry, with venture capital (VC) investments witnessing a substantial rebound, breaking a two-year downtrend. The Resurgence of Crypto Investments in Q1 2024",
    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker The Resurgence of Crypto Investments in Q1 2024 According to data analyst Crypto Koryo, there has been a 38% increase in the funds invested, coupled with a 49% rise in the number of projects receiving funding, signaling a renewed confidence in the crypto space. This resurgence draws parallels to the investment patterns observed in the fourth quarter of 2020, preceding a massive influx of venture capital into the sector. Photo: Crypto Koryo Investment Highlights and Key Players Photo: Crypto Koryo VC funding has seen an impressive upsurge, with over $2 billion being injected into various projects, a 38% increase from Q4 2023. This period also saw an uptick in the number of projects funded, reaching 250. Notably, the investment landscape in March alone boasted an astonishing $1.1 billion across 180 investments, highlighting a month-on-month jump of 52.50%. Leading the charge were crypto-native VCs like Andreessen Horowitz Crypto, OKX Ventures, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, and Polychain, which dominated the investment sphere, marking a shift from previous quarters dominated by banks and non-crypto VCs. Insights from the Front Lines A cohort of nine prominent venture capitalists shed light on the driving forces behind this remarkable first quarter. With a total capital of $2.52 million raised across the crypto and blockchain sectors, the sentiment amongst investors is reminiscent of the enthusiasm seen in 2021. This investment spree is attributed to several factors, including landmark legal victories, burgeoning interest in DeFi platforms like Solana, and a general increase in demand for cryptocurrencies following regulatory approvals in the US. Alex Felix, co-founder and chief investment officer at CoinFund, observed: “During the first quarter, there was a careful optimism in the crypto venture capital funding environment, which marked a recovery from two challenging years of fundraising hurdles faced by both firms and fund managers.” Where Are Investments Flowing? The revived interest in crypto VC funding has spotlighted areas ripe for innovation and growth. Investments have surged in sectors ranging from DeFi and SocialFi to Bitcoin layer-2 solutions. Web3 gaming and AI-integrated blockchain technologies are also attracting significant venture capital attention, indicative of the market’s appetite for groundbreaking developments in the crypto space. A Founder-Friendly Market The competitive landscape has created a founder-friendly environment where entrepreneurs wield greater leverage in fundraising endeavours. This dynamic has resulted in accelerated deal-making, with investors keen on not missing out on promising opportunities. As a result, valuations have spiked, with pre-seed rounds seeing valuations under $10 million in crypto consumer spaces and sectors like crypto and AI reaching valuations upwards of $300 million. A Promising Horizon for Crypto VC As we advance through 2024, the early-stage funding space in crypto is expected to maintain its heat, driven by a combination of institutional interest and macroeconomic factors such as the upcoming Bitcoin halving and potential rate cuts in the US. However, the landscape remains dynamic, with regulatory developments poised to play a pivotal role. In conclusion, the first quarter of 2024 has reignited enthusiasm and optimism in the crypto venture capital space.next The Resurgence of Crypto Investments in Q1 2024",

    "article_detailed_content": "Coinspeaker Binance to Restrict Accounts Without KYC Binance Holdings Ltd, one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges is currently in the news as it announces plans to restrict accounts without Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. According to the announcement, only verified and compliant customers will be granted access to their sub-accounts. Accounts Under Scrutiny by Binance Customers who face the chance of being restricted are sub-accounts created by Exchange Link account holders under the Binance Link Program. This is in addition to non-trading accounts created specifically for asset deposits. Accounts that have failed to comply with KYC criteria since March 20 have been restricted, while unverified sub-account holders have received an ultimatum. Binance added that non-compliant sub-accounts will suffer complete limitations on May 20, preventing them from using Binance Link Program services. Exchange Link account holders have been given a KYC link, where they can provide additional user information such as proof of address, source of funds, and source of wealth on behalf of their sub-account holders. According to the announcement, the restriction on non-compliant customers’ accounts would cover areas such as services, deposits, withdrawals, spot trading, futures trading, and margin trading. Binance highlighted that in some instances sub-accounts may be frozen and access to the account blocked. Another instance stated by Binance is that restricted sub-account holders may be unable to receive deposits. In such a scenario, the exchange noted that it may take up to 45 days to refund the misplaced deposit. However, this will come at an administrative charge of $200 regardless of the deposit size. Binance Faces Regulatory Challenges The move by Binance highlights its commitment to ensuring safe and secure regulatory requirements on its platform. Recently, there have been concerns relating to money laundering, and terrorism financing practices in the exchange. In Nigeria, Binance faces allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. According to the tax office, the aforementioned acts are illegal and punishable under Sections 8 and 29 of the VAT Act of 1993 (as amended), Section 40 of the FIRS Establishment Act, 2007 (as amended), and Section 94 of the Companies Income Tax Act (as amended), respectively. As previously reported by Coinspeaker, Nadeem Anjarwalla, one of the key executives at Binance Nigeria, has managed to escape police custody. Anjarwalla alongside the financial crimes’ compliance officer Tigran Gambaryan was arrested and detained on February 26, 2024. The Nigerian government charges Anjarwalla and Gambaryan with operating Binance Nigeria without registration with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). In a recent development, The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said it will prosecute Binance and the two top executives on Thursday, 4th April 2024. Following the hearing, the case was further adjourned to April 19. Overall, Binance’s new KYC implementation on sub-account holders is indicative of a proactive measure to ensure a safe compliance trading ecosystem going forward. Despite ongoing regulatory hurdles it needs to climb, the future appears bright for the exchange.next Binance to Restrict Accounts Without KYC",

As of this report, the Cardano network had about $370 million in total value locked (TVL) and more than $20 million in stablecoins market cap. The Cardano network has been improving its performance in a bid to match up with other layer-one ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum.

Impact on ADA Price Action After experiencing heavy resistance around the 200 weekly Moving Average (MA), the ADA price has been trapped in a choppy situation. The large-cap altcoin aiming to dethrone Ethereum as the web3 leader, dropped more than 3 percent to trade around 56 cents on Friday. Nevertheless, ADA price has not yet invalidated the macro bullish outlook despite the ongoing consolidation. From a technical perspective, ADA price has been forming higher highs and higher lows on the weekly time frame, an established characteristic of a rising trend. Unless ADA price falls below the crucial support level of around 44 cents in the coming weeks, the altcoin is well positioned to retest its all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.next Grayscale Drops Cardano From Its Large Cap Fund, ADA Price Down Over 12% This Week",

Despite this accumulation, the address still retains a significant stake, holding 2.53 million $DYDX with a total valuation of $7.69 million. The flurry of activity surrounding $DYDX reflects the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets, where whales wield considerable influence over price movements. As the token grapples with its recent bearish performance, the actions of major players like the Amber Group continue to shape its trajectory.

    "article_detailed_content": "Top Crypto Presales to Invest in: BlockDAG’s 20,000x ROI Looms Large Alongside HBAR Price Prediction and Borroe Finance Prospects As the cryptocurrency landscape burgeons with innovative players, BlockDAG emerges as a standout in the presale domain, challenging the status quo established by peers like Hedera Hashgraph and Borroe Finance. While HBAR and Borroe Finance boast technical strengths and market potential, BlockDAG’s recent Las Vegas Sphere event, unveiling its technical whitepaper v2, underscores its pioneering stance in transaction speed and security. This marks a significant milestone in its journey and solidifies BlockDAG Network‘s position as a frontrunner in the crypto world, offering a unique blend of speed, security, and investor confidence, making its presale a notable event in the cryptocurrency market. HBAR Price Predictions: What Lies Ahead? The HBAR price prediction delves into Hedera Hashgraph’s potential market performance over the coming years. The recent data forecasts an optimistic price trajectory for HBAR, highlighting its technical strengths and innovative distributed ledger technology. HBAR’s value is anticipated to reach $0.12 by 2024, climb to $0.162 by 2025, and potentially escalate to $0.592 by 2030. These predictions underscore the belief in Hedera’s capacity to address scalability and efficiency, marking it as a promising investment within the cryptocurrency space. Innovative & Profitable Borroe Finance Presale The Borroe finance presale draws significant attention, promising substantial prospects in comparison to Cardano and Stellar. Touted for its impressive growth potential, Borroe Finance has emerged as a preferred choice for investors in the cryptocurrency space. The project introduces cutting-edge solutions to overcome the traditional financial systems’ challenges, specifically tackling problems related to liquidity pools and flash loans. With the current presale stage pricing $ROE tokens at $0.02 and projections for price increases, investors are seeing considerable gains and a promising opportunity for future returns. Introducing BlockDAG: Where Security Meets Speed The BlockDAG event at the Las Vegas Sphere, unveiling its technical whitepaper v2, represents a significant moment. This event highlights the combination of blockchain security with BlockDAG’s fast technology, which is changing the crypto world. With a transaction speed of 10,000 to 15,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS), BlockDAG exceeds the transaction capacity of older blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, BlockDAG’s presale success is remarkable, predicted to reach an impressive $3 to $5 million daily, reflecting unwavering investor confidence in its vision and technology. As the pioneer of DAG chains, BlockDAG surpasses the constraints of traditional blockchains, providing fast and secure transactions and increased scalability tailored to the needs of the modern digital economy. Progressing to Batch 6, this project confirms its sustainability and boosts community excitement about its future, ranking it among the top crypto presales for investment. BlockDAG’s innovative approach positions it for substantial growth, with forecasts indicating a rise to $10 by 2025. The attraction, however, is its potential for an astonishing 20,000x return on investment, underscoring its disruptive impact and potential for exponential growth. Recently, BlockDAG exceeded expectations, raising over $12.7 million in presales and distributing 6.4 billion coins with a 20,000x potential. Priced at $0.0035 per coin in batch 6, it offers lucrative returns. Beyond profits, BlockDAG innovates income diversification and mining experiences, solidifying its position as a leading bullish crypto with over 4300 miners sold. Concluding Thoughts HBAR, Borroe Finance, and BlockDAG present distinct and promising opportunities as the crypto world unfolds. While HBAR shows steady growth, Borroe Finance emerges as a promising contender, drawing attention for its innovative solutions. However, BlockDAG stands out as the ultimate game-changer, with its potential for a remarkable 20,000x ROI, making it an irresistible investment choice. With its recent white paper release and visionary approach, BlockDAG not only leads in performance but also sets the standard for the future of finance.

Considering these returns, anyone would be tempted to invest in BEFE. But what would an investment of $100 in BEFE yield, and at what time? Let’s find out. What’s Fueling BEFE’s Growth? Here’s what’s primarily fueling the coin’s growth: Zero Taxes and No Presale: Unlike majority meme coins, BEFE came out without any presale or taxes. Because of this, those sneaky investors could not play with the price, creating an atmosphere of equality. This also prevented early investors from dumping to dwarf the coin’s price. Scarcity: Also, the coin’s supply is pretty scarce at just 100 billion tokens. And as there’s a burn mechanism that removes coins from circulation, the tokens become even more scarce over time. This makes the coin rare and thus more in demand. A Strong Team: The meme coin has a diligent team backing it. They’re following a utility-focused and planning to list BEFE on 3 exchanges this week. Also, the team consistently interacts with the community and organizes giveaways, keeping them engaged. Integration with Bitgert: BEFE is integrated with Bitgert, a hyper-scalable architecture. Because of this, investors can stake the meme coin and earn BRISE (Bitgert’s native token) as a reward. Is BEFE Expected to Growth in the Days to Come? Based on the data available from CoinCodex, the sentiment associated with the meme king is bearish. However, the meme coin is expected to reach $ 0.000574 by April 8, 2024, from $0.0004534 on April 3, 2024, according to a prediction made by the same source (30.32% rise). Also, BEFE could potentially reach $0.001450 with a growth rate of (228.96%) in the next 30 days (May 3, 2024). What Would Your $100 Investment in BEFE Look Like? Investing $100 today at $0.0004546 would get you around ($1/ $0.0004546*100) 219,973.60 BEFE. Based on the predictions, your investment of $100 would grow 30.32 times to $130 over 5 days. Similarly, a growth rate of 228.96% would transform your investment to a good $328.96 within 30 days. Considering the positive predictions associated with BEFE and the USPs it brings, investing in the meme coin could potentially bring massive returns for investors.

    "article_detailed_content": "For weeks, bears and bulls have continued to battle for market dominance as the halving event of the most prominent cryptocurrency approaches. Late last month, bulls pushed hard to set an all-time high for Bitcoin before the anticipated event. Despite this, BTC transitioned into a consolidation phase before a further decline in the last few days, asking questions about its forecasted surge in April. Amid the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin’s price trajectory, Bitgert Coin is proving to be the ultimate choice for renowned investors in the market. Investors have identified the Bitgert project as one that would lead them to a substantial financial win this year. Boasting real solutions, unique features, and a rapidly growing ecosystem, Bitgert seems ready to migrate many to prosperity in 2024. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Last week, Bitcoin’s price encountered significant buying pressure in the crucial support regions (i.e., $62,000 and $59,000), which led to a renewed bullish trend in its price action. During this period, Bulls attempted to push BTC into the $72,000 resistance region. Despite the bullish effort, bulls fell short of the bearish pressure, and Bitcoin couldn’t break through this crucial resistance zone. After a consequent fall of nearly 4.5% in less than a week, BTC traded between the $65,069 support and the $71,551 resistance in the same period. While it seems the market is bleeding, and BTC is down by nearly 0.5% compared to its price yesterday, the current pullback in BTC price could be a sign of a healthy market correction, not necessarily a cause for panic. Experts believe Bitcoin will make a significant rally at some point before its halving event. Bitgert Coin to Reward Investors in April Labelled by top analysts as one of the lucrative projects of 2024, Bitgert Coin has grown to be a must-have for investors seeking an easy way to a prosperous year. Bitgert outperforms its competitors, like Solana, Avalanche, Tron, etc., in cost and efficiency by depending on a proof-of-authority (PoA) architecture to provide quick block times and ultra-low gas fees. Through the Brise Chain, Bitgert’s native blockchain, Bitgert can process transactions at super-fast speed, reaching up to 100K transactions per second (TPS). Other native products aside from Brise Chain within the Bitgert ecosystem include Bitgert Exchange, Bitgert, P2P Marketplace, LocalBitgert, etc. These growing number of solutions and projects hosted (like Miidas NFT Marketplace, Pupazzi Punk, BRISE Paradise, etc.) have attracted more users and grown traction within Bitgert’s ecosystem. Conclusion While Ethereum and Solana are facing network congestion and bot attacks, Bitgert’s deflationary feature and focus on providing users with innovative solutions are setting it up for an exponential surge in its market value.

    "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin (BTC) falls below $70,000, causing market-wide losses, particularly in altcoins. Investors turn to Algotech (ALGT) amid market uncertainty, with its $3.6 million presale offering potential gains of 1200%. Algotech’s decentralized trading platform gains traction, poised for growth in the DeFi sector amidst market volatility. Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, has experienced a significant price correction in recent days, dipping below the psychologically important $70,000 mark. This sudden downturn has sent ripples through the entire cryptocurrency market, with altcoins experiencing even steeper losses. As uncertainty clouds the market, some investors are seeking refuge in innovative projects like Algotech (ALGT), which is currently conducting a highly anticipated presale. Bitcoin’s wobble: A cause for concern? Bitcoin’s price has experienced quite a ride in 2024. After reaching an all-time high of nearly $74,000 in March, the leading cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain momentum, hitting a low of $60,783 in March and currently trading at $66,382 as of the time of writing. Analysts point to several factors that could be responsible for the ups and downs. First is the cyclic pattern that Bitcoin’s price exhibits before its halving event every four years. The market experiences an induced bear action to sweep as low as possible for higher profit potential, or many investors sell off their positions due to market uncertainty. A second possible reason could be profit-taking. Since the bull run of 2021, the entire cryptocurrency market has had to suffer the long bear market that bled many investors. The scent of revival in the market could have triggered a lot of profit-takings to recover losses and diversify a portfolio. This is purely speculative. Technically, the overall sentiment on the current market is very bullish, with the greed/fear index reading as high as 75 — showing extreme greed. Some believe this retracement to be a temporary shift to sweep liquidity and then rebound stronger to make new highs. Altcoin bloodbath: Collateral damage or underlying issues? The impact on altcoins has been greater than that on Bitcoin. In recent days, many altcoins have seen double-digit percentage losses. The general downturn in market sentiment may explain this, but it also calls into doubt the viability of certain cryptocurrency projects. It is possible that investors are reassessing their assets and moving their money to more reputable or promising platforms. Algotech (ALGT): A beacon of stability and profitability? Volatility is not leaving the cryptocurrency market anytime soon. However, certain projects whose prospects present a level of stability that investors may consider for diversification. Algotech (ALGT) is one such project that has garnered significant attention in recent weeks. ALGT’s ongoing presale has recorded a massive influx of investors, which is reflected in the rate at which its tokens are sold. Currently priced at $0.08, the third stage of the presale is approaching $3.7 million, with a few million tokens left to be sold. Analysts expect the algorithmic trading industry to boom in 2024. Seeing that Algotech is well-positioned as a decentralized crypto algorithmic trading platform for the DeFi ecosystem, an analyst Predicts Algotech could increase by 1200% from its tentative listing price of $0.15 to $1 this year.

    "article_summary": "As Bitcoin prices continued to slide, the options market presented a peculiar scenario with a notable absence of put options being traded.

Bitcoin Whales Capitalize On This Slight Dip To Accumulate Ethereum Meanwhile, reports from Lookonchain suggest that whales are capitalizing on the market dip to accumulate Ethereum. Notable entities such as Fenbushi Capital and Galaxy Digital were observed withdrawing substantial amounts of ETH from Binance following the market downturn. Both Fenbushi Capital and Galaxy Digital withdrew $ETH from #Binance after the market dropped. Fenbushi Capital withdrew 5,207.4 $ETH($17.2M) from #Binance 11 hours ago. Galaxy Digital withdrew 6,000 $ETH($19.8M) from #Binance 4 hours ago. Address:https://t.co/wJDIeJ6o97… pic.twitter.com/gDQBKMIK96 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 3, 2024 Fenbushi Capital withdrew 5,207.4 ETH ($17.2 million) approximately 11 hours ago, while Galaxy Digital withdrew 6,000 ETH ($19.8 million) around 4 hours ago. Despite the bearish trend in Bitcoin, Ethereum is currently trading at $3317, indicating resilience in the face of market volatility. As investors navigate the uncertain market conditions, the dynamics in the options market and the strategic moves of whales provide valuable insights into the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Santiment’s data further reveals that LTC experienced a peak in on-chain transaction volume at the end of March, coinciding with a significant price uptick.

    "article_detailed_content": "The Ethereum (ETH) network has witnessed a surge in validators following the Shapella upgrade. This has raised concerns about technical capacity and the potential for centralization. With validators now able to withdraw their staked ETH for the first time, the blockchain ecosystem is facing renewed scrutiny. Amidst this anticipation and apprehension, analysts are optimistic about InQubeta (QUBE), an AI-driven altcoin that many expect to have a remarkable year. InQubeta, which a number of analysts have billed as a top DeFi coin, has generated excitement among artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiasts and investors alike. Analysts predict a bullish year for this coin, driven by its impressive features and ability to defy market trends with stellar growth. As the cryptocurrency ICO is in the final phase, QUBE users anticipate substantial gains in 2024. This article unveils the reasons behind analysts’ interest in InQubeta amid the positive outlook on the ETH ecosystem. InQubeta (QUBE): Pioneering the space with AI innovation and impressive presale Following significant advancements in the cryptocurrency industry, financial analysts predict a promising outlook for InQubeta, anticipating a successful year. This optimism stems from the impressive presale performance. The cryptocurrency ICO has already witnessed a remarkable 300% growth, rapidly transitioning from the initial to the final stage. By raising over $13 million through the sale of over 947 million tokens, InQubeta’s future trajectory seems undeniable. Due to the substantial buying pressure surrounding this top DeFi coin, less than 9% of the tokens remain available. However, investors still have ample opportunity to benefit from QUBE by participating in the ongoing presale. With the current discounted price of $0.028 locked in for this phase, a diverse user base with varying budgets can take advantage of this opportunity. With presale price set to increase to $0.0308, the early bird stage represents a potential 340% upside compared to the initial stage. The reason behind this anticipated surge is the special advantages provided to holders of the currency, QUBE. QUBE is a deflationary token. With every buy or sell transaction, a 2% fee is charged. These fees are stored in a separate “burn wallet,” effectively removing them from circulation. Additionally, when someone sells QUBE, an extra 5% tax is levied. These funds are deposited into a dedicated reward pool. This strategy ranks InQubeta among the best altcoins as it encourages long-term investment while also generating supplemental income for investors. InQubeta combines artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, establishing itself among the best altcoins with distinct investment opportunities. This fusion presents a unique chance for expansion and innovation. With these features plus a bullish prediction from analysts, QUBE holders have a higher chance of enjoying a stellar year, just like Ethereum. Ethereum (ETH): Fidelity flags centralization risks amid validator surge The rise in Ethereum validators following the Shapella upgrade raises concerns about technical strain and centralization, according to Fidelity Digital Assets. With active validators increasing by 74%, Fidelity anticipates more challenging roadmap upgrades. Analyst Daniel Gray warns that an extensive ETH validator network could face bandwidth and latency issues. Each new Ethereum validator amplifies network bandwidth needs, potentially leading to self-hosted nodes dropping out and increased centralization. Gray highlights that households need to work on keeping up with institutional data centers, which raises centralization risks. While the recent growth in ETH validators has slowed, future projections remain uncertain, posing centralization and bandwidth dilemmas. Final thoughts Amid Ethereum’s validator surge and ensuing scrutiny, the spotlight is turning towards InQubeta as the next big player in cryptocurrency. As many analysts predict a bullish year for this AI-driven altcoin, is now the time to seize the opportunity and consider investing in QUBE? With over $13 million raised in its ICO, the future outlook for this coin appears promising.

    "article_detailed_content": "The cryptocurrency bull run has faded recently as many investors take profits and wait for the next catalyst. Bitcoin price has retreated from an all-time high of over $73,000 to $67,000. Similarly, Ethereum token has plunged from over $4,000 to $3,320. As a result, the total market cap of all digital coins has dropped from almost $3 trillion to $2.6 trillion. Despite these challenges, BitBot has continued its bullish momentum as its token sale jumped to over $2 million. Why crypto bull run has faded There are two main reasons why the crypto bull run has faded in the past few weeks. First, there are signs that the much-anticipated rate cut by the Federal Reserve will not happen any time soon. This view was supported by Friday’s strong job numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the American economy added over 303k jobs in March, higher than the median estimate of 212k. The economy has added jobs for 36 straight months, the longest winning streak in years. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8% while the average hourly earnings rose by 4.1%, down from 4.3% in the previous month. These numbers came a few days after the ISM said that the manufacturing PMI increased in March, the first time since 2022. There are also signs that inflation slowdown has slowed in the past few months. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) stood at 3.1 in February while the core CPI remained at 3.8%. The core CPI is almost double the Fed target of 2.0%. Therefore, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have dropped because most investors expect that the Fed will not cut rates this year. Other analysts expect at least one cut, down from three or four when the year started. This also explains why stocks have tumbled this week. BitBot token sale continues Meanwhile, the BitBot token sale has continued this week as the developers raised over $2 million, meaning that there is strong demand. Its token sale has now moved to its stage 9. For starters, BitBot is a company that is seeking to disrupt the financial and trading industry. The developers are building Telegram bots that will send signals to thousands of customers. To be clear: Telegram bots are not new. It is a big industry with thousands of companies offering the service. A careful look at these platforms show that most of them are scams. BitBot aims to change this by creating a genuinely honest trading bot powered by the blockchain technology. It will also be a decentralized bot, where token holders will make decisions about the network. Token holders will also take part in revenue sharing, get exclusive access to its products, and the ability to mingle with the community and trading experts. Therefore, unlike meme coins like MEME, Book of Meme, Bonk, and Samoyedcoin which have no utility, BitBot will have important use. This utility could help to stabilize its price even when there is a new crypto winter. Still, there is no uncertainty that the BitBot token price will rise after being listed by major exchanges. As a result, it is always important to use risk management strategies to prevent substantial losses. You can buy the BitBot token here.

Goldman Sachs, Citadel, Citigroup, UBS and ABN AMRO join Jane Street Capital, JP Morgan, Virtu andMacquarie as APs for BlackRock’s IBIT. BlackRock just updated its spot Bitcoin ETF prospectus, adding five new Authorized Participants (APs). Those to make the new list of APs for the world’s largest asset manager’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF are Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs, Citadel and Citigroup. UBS Securities and ABN AMRO Clearing are also added, according to details in the prospectus. With this, BlackRock, whose IBIT has stormed to billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin (BTC) holdings for its ETF, has pushed its APs total from just four to nine. Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin continues Initially, BlackRock named JP Morgan, Jane Street Capital, Virtu Americas and Macquarie as its authorized participants. This expansion comes amid expected spike in inflows as more people seek exposure to BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and the other APs entry suggests “big time firms now want piece of action.” It also indicates that these companies are now open to “being publicly associated with” Bitcoin spot ETFs, he added. “Up until now Citi, GS, UBS and Citadel were not named in any of these ETF filings. So they either new OR they were ashamed before to be ID-ed but are now cool. Either way, likely a result of the ETFs’ mega-flows/success,” Balchunas opined via a post on X. Analysts have noted that one catalyst to the sharp spike in BTC price has been US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. For instance, Bitcoin ETFs traded more than $111 billion in March, nearly three times trades recorded in February and January. Elsewhere, the regulatory nod added to the global trend in renewed mainstream adoption of crypto, with demand for more investment assets seeing BlackRock and other firms file proposals for spot Ethereum ETFs.

    "article_detailed_content": "Base’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume has hit new highs. New cryptocurrency Rebel Satoshi creates waves in the market amid investor excitement around its potential. Analysts say Rebel Satoshi could be one of the best memecoins to buy; could it outperform Shiba Inu? The world of cryptocurrency continues to be something of a rollercoaster ride, with established players vying for dominance alongside new projects clawing their way to the top. Two stories have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts in recent days: the surging trading volume on Base’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and the meteoric rise of the memecoin Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ). Base’s DEX volume hits new heights Base’s decentralized exchange (DEX) has recently been making waves in the crypto community. Data from Dune Analytics reveals a staggering surge in trading volume, reaching a record high of $1.2 billion on March 30. This marks a significant milestone for Base, signaling growing interest and activity within its ecosystem. As one of the top crypto coins gaining traction in the market, Base has cemented its position as a formidable player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With a diverse range of assets and a vibrant community, Base’s DEX has become a hub for traders seeking liquidity and opportunity. Spotlight on Rebel Satoshi’s ascent Amidst the flurry of activity surrounding Base, another cryptocurrency has been quietly making its presence known. Rebel Satoshi ($RBLZ) has been generating buzz in the market, with some analysts describing it as one of the best memecoins to watch, with its unique blend of digital art, collectibles, and community engagement. Can it outshine Shiba Inu? While Rebel Satoshi may be a newcomer compared to established players like Shiba Inu, its rapid ascent has not gone unnoticed. With its distinctive features and vibrant ecosystem, Rebel Satoshi is carving out its niche in the crypto landscape. Shiba Inu, known for its meme coin status, has long been a favorite among investors. However, Rebel Satoshi’s innovative approach and strong community support could position it as a serious contender for the title of best memecoin. The rise of Rebel Satoshi Arcade ($RECQ) Adding to the excitement surrounding Rebel Satoshi is the recent emergence of Rebel Satoshi Arcade ($RECQ) tokens. Designed as the native token of the Rebel Satoshi ecosystem, $RECQ offers users a gateway to a world of rewards, gaming, and community engagement. With its presale currently underway, $RECQ has already seen significant interest from investors. The Early Bird stage sold out in less than three weeks, indicating strong demand for this new token. At the current stage one price of $0.0037 per $RECQ token, investors have a prime opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this exciting project. Conclusion As the crypto market continues to evolve, it’s clear that innovation and creativity are key drivers of success. Base’s DEX volume surge highlights the growing interest in decentralized finance, while Rebel Satoshi’s ascent underscores the power of community-driven projects. With Rebel Satoshi Arcade ($RECQ) on the horizon, the future of this dynamic ecosystem looks bright. As investors eagerly await the next stage of $RECQ’s presale, it’s clear that the excitement surrounding Rebel Satoshi shows no signs of slowing down.

    "article_detailed_content": "TLDR BONK is one of the top crypto coins to buy in 2024. MEME rose 14.51% over the past month. The Milei Moneda ($MEDA) is attracting investors as its presale accelerates. BONK and MEME have seen their values increase recently and have the potential for further growth. However, a growing number of investors are investing in a new coin, Milei Moneda ($MEDA), which has impressed analysts so far in its presale. It has attracted a huge number of investors and has been added to many chartists’ lists of the best cryptos to invest in. Read on to learn more. Economize Like Milei: Invest in $MEDA BONK sees gains, but investors are still seeking more profitable investments BONK has performed well lately, with a 26.11% price increase over the past week. On the monthly chart, BONK has also made gains, rising 14.51% and becoming a top crypto to buy in 2024. So far, BONK has been able to foster broad participation and inclusivity by distributing a huge fraction of its tokens to Solana users, including developers and artists. This unique strategy has led to a rise in trading activity, placing BONK among the most traded cryptos on Solana-based exchanges. In addition, BONK has been able to integrate into the Solana ecosystem, thereby powering different decentralized applications and NFT collections. With its Solana integration and community focus, BONK provides exciting possibilities. However, it carries the risks linked with meme coins. This is why some BONK enthusiasts are seeking to diversify with other profitable investments like Milei Moneda ($MEDA), which has performed remarkably well so far in its presale. Memecoin (MEME) price analysis: Are investors seeking other profitable alternatives? Memecoin (MEME) is currently in an upward trend after seeing a 2.73% rise over the past week. Compared to its price last month, Memecoin (MEME) also made gains, with a 14.51% increase during that period. Memecoin (MEME) launched just recently, but this upward trend indicates that the best is yet to come for Memecoin (MEME). Furthermore, it is surrounded by a bullish sentiment with a Fear and Greed Index Value of 75 (indicating Extreme Greed). So, this is a good time to invest in Memecoin (MEME). Despite this potential, MEME investors are looking into the Milei Moneda presale. The project has been successful so far, with the potential 100% ROI for early birds more than what Memecoin (MEME) can offer. The outlook, therefore, has $MEDA emerging as one of the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. As a crypto enthusiast, it could be worth considering an investment in both Memecoin (MEME) and Milei Moneda ($MEDA). Milei Moneda ($MEDA) attracts crypto investors with its huge investment opportunity For investors who are seeking opportunities to make gains in the meme coin market, some analysts believe Milei Moneda could be one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Milei Moneda, a true meme coin newly introduced in the crypto space, is at the forefront of savvy investors. The recognition and popularity of this meme coin can be traced back to the inspiration it got from Argentina’s President, Javier Milei. The benefits that come with investing in Milei Moneda go beyond financial gains, as it offers investors a sense of engagement through its vibrant community and provides members with governance rights. Investors can obtain membership through Milei Moneda’s official token, popularly known as $MEDA. In addition, investors receive rewards like NFT stakes and get to enjoy monthly giveaways from the platform. The presale of $MEDA has started, and investors are seizing the opportunity to purchase this token at a price of $0.010. Still, in Stage 1 of its presale, $MEDA creates an enticing investment prospect for early investors. With plans to launch $MEDA at $0.020 per token, investors are likely to eye the potential 100% increase from the initial token price. Milei Moneda aims to transform simple investments into huge gains for hodlers; that’s why a number of analysts have described it as the best crypto for beginners. Got $MEDA curiosity?

    "article_detailed_content": "Grayscale has removed Cardano (ADA) from its Digital Large Cap Fund following a quarterly rebalancing. The asset manager also removed Cosmos (ATOM) from its smart contracts fund. Crypto asset manager Grayscale provides quarterly updates for its multi-asset funds Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, Grayscale DeFi Fund, and the Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund. In its latest report, the GBTC issuer said it adjusted the GDLC’s portfolio to remove Cardano (ADA). The company noted that cash proceeds from ADA were used to purchase other assets in the fund “in proportion to their respective weightings.” After these changes, the GDLC now holds 70.96% Bitcoin (BTC), 21.84% Ethereum (ETH), 4.52% Solana (SOL), 1.73% XRP and 0.95% Avalanche (AVAX). Grayscale also rebalanced its smart contract platform fund after dropping Cosmos (ATOM). Notably, Cardano remains part of this fund. According to details shared in a press release, the fund now holds 58.41% Solana (SOL), 14.56% Cardano (ADA), 12.25% Avalanche (AVAX), 8.53% Polkadot (DOT), and 6.25% Polygon (MATIC). Meanwhile, Grayscale’s DeFi Fund remained unchanged with Uniswap (UNI) accounting for 48.74%, MakerDAO (MKR) 20.41%, Lido (LDO) 13.17%, Aave (AAVE) 9.99% and Synthetix (SNX) 7.69%. ADA price outlook Cardano’s current price of $0.57 is down more than 81% since the cryptocurrency reached a high of $3.09 amid a stellar 2021 bull market performance. This cycle, ADA has struggled to break to $1. The token reached highs of $0.78 in mid-March as top coin Bitcoin raced to a new all-time high above $73k. Ethereum also broke above $4,000 to come close to its previous bull market peak. ADA’s struggles have pushed its market cap from highs of $95 billion in September 2021 to around $20 billion.

The team also recently unveiled its new state-of-the-art, crypto-powered Mastercard debit cards integrated with popular digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Central to the Choise.com ecosystem is the CHO token, facilitating various functionalities and incentivizing user engagement. The CHO token serves as a fundamental component of the platform’s operations and utility. It represents a means of value exchange within the Choise.ai ecosystem, facilitating various transactions and interactions among users and services. Initially introduced as part of Choise.com’s tokenomics upgrade, the CHO token plays a pivotal role in incentivizing user participation and engagement.

Choise.com’s expansion into the B2B sector Choise.com’s recent foray into the business-to-business (B2B) realm marks a significant strategic move aimed at unlocking new avenues of growth and profitability. Central to this expansion is the introduction of Vault, a revolutionary product designed to cater to the needs of institutional clients seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Vault’s profitability projections and innovative features position it as a game-changer in the realm of institutional crypto banking, offering lucrative opportunities for clients seeking to capitalize on the digital asset revolution. According to a recent announcement, Choise.com integrated its platform’s offerings with Vaults’s innovative solutions forming a game-changing ecosystem dubbed the Choise.ai ecosystem. The Choise.ai ecosystem Choise.ai represents the culmination of Choise.com’s evolution, serving as a groundbreaking ecosystem that seamlessly integrates the platform’s offerings with Vault’s innovative solutions. By merging Choise.com and Vault into a cohesive ecosystem, Choise.ai aims to leverage the strengths of both platforms to deliver unparalleled value to users and stakeholders alike. The ecosystem focuses on B2B expansion and offers new revenue opportunities for CHO holders. Notably, CHO token holders can stake tokens and earn a share of Vault’s revenue, further enhancing the utility and value proposition of the CHO token within the ecosystem. Through token staking, CHO holders can earn up to 20% of Vault’s revenue, providing them with a direct share of the profits generated by institutional clients utilizing Vault’s services. This innovative mechanism not only incentivizes token holders to stake their CHO tokens but also aligns their interests with the success and growth of the Choise.com ecosystem. Furthermore, the CHO token serves as a medium for governance within the Choise.ai ecosystem, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes and vote on key proposals or changes. This democratic approach empowers the community to shape the future direction of the platform, fostering a sense of ownership and involvement among stakeholders. Conclusion Choise.com’s recent developments in tokenomics and expansion into the B2B domain mark a significant milestone in the company’s journey. With its comprehensive suite of digital/crypto banking products, commitment to regulatory compliance and security, and visionary leadership, Choise.com is well-positioned to thrive in the long term.

WIF price is projected to surge to $4.2 if it holds the current support level. Algotech’s $ALGT presale raises $3.7M; token priced at 0.08 tether. Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced a significant price pullback causing concern among investors. As WIF retraces, investors are turning to new crypto projects like Algotech that are offering investment opportunities with their presale stages. Dogwifhat (WIF) price pullback causes concern Dogwifhat (WIF) has faced a notable downturn, with its price plummeting by 14% within a day, marking the largest single-day price drop over the past seven days. At present, the token is trading at $3.31, marking a substantial decline from its peak of $4.8189 reached on March 31, 2024. Despite this pullback, Dogwifhat’s price remains 51% higher than a month ago, showcasing its overall growth trajectory although investors are starting to get worried about what the future holds. Dogwifhat price prediction There are mixed sentiments regarding Dogwifhat’s (WIF) price forecast. While the recent pullback has dampened hopes of the token reclaiming its $4 mark soon, some analysts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. With the broader crypto market undergoing consolidation ahead of the Bitcoin halving, there’s potential for WIF to regain momentum and surpass the $4 threshold again. Some analysts like Pando believe it is just a matter of time before WIF regains its bullish trend, especially seeing that the RSI indicator is almost at its bottom.

That could mean a further near 45% drop from current levels. pic.twitter.com/DAYD10umMP — Dendy (@tutdenizka) April 5, 2024 Algotech: redefining crypto trading Algotech emerges as a leading player in the crypto trading sphere, offering a cutting-edge decentralized algorithmic trading platform.

    "article_summary": "Hong Kong's virtual lender ZA Bank is embracing digital finance by engaging with potential stablecoin issuers to establish fiat reserve accounts. This initiative marks a significant step towards integrating digital assets into traditional banking in Hong Kong as the country explores listing digital-asset exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to enhance its presence in the sector. Exploring Stablecoin Reserves According to a report by Bloomberg, ZA Bank's Alternate Chief Executive, Devon Sin, revealed in a recent interview about the bank's initiative to engage with existing and prospective stablecoin issuers. Sin emphasized the versatility of stablecoins, highlighting their potential applications in wholesale and retail markets, tokenization, exchange trading settlements, and cross-border remittances. He expressed ZA Bank's interest in exploring tangible use cases for stablecoins in collaboration with potential issuers once admitted to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's regulatory sandbox. Hong Kong aims to position itself as a digital asset hub. The city has taken significant strides in regulating the crypto sector, licensing its first crypto trading platforms, and exploring the listing of ETFs. Hong Kong’s ZA Bank is talking to potential stablecoin issuers about setting up accounts for the cash reserves that would back the tokens https://t.co/FDWyd3kr5s — Bloomberg (@business) April 4, 2024 Additionally, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is in the process of formulating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which typically maintain a 1-1 peg to fiat currency and are backed by cash and bond reserves. ZA Bank has reportedly facilitated over $1 billion in transfers from more than 100 Web 3 clients. Hong Kong Regulates Stablecoin Issuers Last year, Hong Kong adopted the regulation of stablecoin issuers. The proposed rules, outlined in a consultation paper by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, marked a significant move towards ensuring stability and security within the digital asset ecosystem, Finance Magnates reported. The consultation paper defined stablecoins as digital assets pegged to one or more fiat currencies, aiming to maintain a stable value. Under the proposed rules, stablecoin issuers actively marketing their fiat-referenced stablecoins to the Hong Kong public must obtain a local license. Notably, algorithmic stablecoins are not permitted in the region, a decision influenced by the collapse of TerraUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin. To obtain a license, stablecoin issuers must adhere to stringent requirements. They must maintain a full reserve of assets backing the stablecoins, ensuring it is at least equal to the par value. These reserves must be segregated and securely stored, and they must be regularly reported to regulators. Additionally, stablecoin issuers must establish a local presence by appointing key personnel, including a Chief Executive Officer and senior management team.

    "article_summary": "The Midas touch of financial technology is transforming the way we pay. Artificial intelligence algorithms are weaving themselves into the fabric of payments, promising to streamline transactions, personalize experiences, and usher in a new era of financial efficiency. But with this potential for golden opportunities comes the risk of a flawed touch and the thought lingers: can we ensure these AI oracles operate with the transparency and fairness needed to build trust in a future shaped by code? Across the globe, governments are wrestling with this very dilemma. The European Union (EU) has emerged as a standard-bearer with its landmark AI Act. This legislation establishes a tiered system, reserving the most rigorous scrutiny for high-risk applications like those used in critical infrastructure or, crucially, financial services. Imagine an AI system making autonomous loan decisions. The AI Act would demand rigorous testing, robust security, and perhaps most importantly, explainability. We must ensure these algorithms aren't perpetuating historical biases or making opaque pronouncements that could financially cripple individuals. Transparency becomes paramount in this new payments arena. Consumers deserve to understand the logic behind an AI system flagging a transaction as fraudulent or denying access to a particular financial product and the EU's AI Act seeks to dismantle this opaqueness, demanding clear explanations that rebuild trust in the system. Meanwhile, the US takes a different approach. The recent Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence prioritizes a delicate dance – fostering innovation while safeguarding against potential pitfalls. The order emphasizes robust AI risk management frameworks, with a focus on mitigating bias and fortifying the security of AI infrastructure. This focus on security is particularly relevant in the payments industry, where data breaches can unleash financial havoc. The order mandates clear reporting requirements for developers of \"dual-use\" AI models, those with civilian and military applications. This could impact the development of AI-powered fraud detection systems, requiring companies to demonstrate robust cybersecurity measures to thwart malicious actors. Further complicating the regulatory landscape, US regulators like Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu have suggested that overseeing the growing involvement of fintech firms in payments might require granting them greater authority. This proposal underscores the potential need for a nuanced approach – ensuring robust oversight without stifling the innovation that fintech firms often bring to the table. These regulations could potentially trigger a wave of collaboration between established financial institutions and AI developers. To comply with stricter regulations, FIs might forge partnerships with companies adept at building secure, explainable AI systems. Such collaboration could lead to the development of more sophisticated fraud detection tools, capable of outsmarting even the most cunning cybercriminals. Additionally, regulations could spur innovation in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) – tools designed to safeguard individual data while still allowing for valuable insights. However, the path paved with regulations can also be riddled with obstacles. Stringent compliance requirements could stifle innovation, particularly for smaller players in the payments industry. The financial burden of developing and deploying AI systems that meet regulatory standards could be prohibitive for some. Additionally, the emphasis on explainability might lead to a \"dumbing down\" of AI algorithms, sacrificing some degree of accuracy for the sake of transparency. This could be particularly detrimental in the realm of fraud detection, where even a slight decrease in accuracy could have significant financial repercussions. Conclusion The AI-powered payments revolution gleams with potential, but shadows of opacity and bias linger. Regulations offer a path forward, potentially fostering collaboration and innovation. Yet, the tightrope walk between robust oversight and stifling progress remains. As AI becomes the Midas of finance, ensuring transparency and fairness will be paramount.

    "article_summary": "The history of communication and commerce is a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of faster, more efficient ways to connect and exchange value. For centuries, merchants along the Silk Road traversed treacherous mountains and vast deserts, their goods changing hands countless times before reaching their final destinations. Today, cross-border payments may lack the physical dangers of the Silk Road, but they remain plagued by inefficiencies: a labyrinthine network of intermediaries, a tangle of regulations, and a glacial pace that can leave businesses frustrated and funds delayed. Businesses and individuals alike face a frustrating maze of intermediaries, regulations, and time zones when sending or receiving funds internationally. These inefficiencies create delays, inflate costs, and ultimately hinder global commerce. Enter Project Agorá, a collaborative effort led by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub that seeks to transform cross-border payments into a digital marketplace as vibrant and efficient as its namesake, the ancient Greek word for \"marketplace.\" The project brings together central banks from major economies, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with leading private financial institutions. Their shared goal: to leverage the power of tokenization and shared ledgers to streamline international business transactions. The current system for cross-border payments is a relic of a bygone era. Transactions can take days to settle, incurring fees at each intermediary along the way. Differing regulations, time zones, and security protocols further complicate the process. This inefficiency creates a drag on global commerce, hindering businesses' ability to expand into new markets and hindering international investment flows. Project Agorá proposes a solution built on the promise of blockchain technology. By tokenizing traditional forms of money – essentially creating digital representations of central bank reserves and commercial bank deposits – Project Agorá aims to establish a faster, more transparent system for cross-border payments. These digital tokens could be transferred near-instantaneously across a shared ledger, a secure digital record accessible to all authorized participants. This shared ledger would eliminate the need for multiple confirmations by intermediaries, significantly speeding up settlement times. But Project Agorá's ambitions extend beyond simply speeding up transactions. The project also explores the potential of smart contracts, self-executing agreements embedded within the shared ledger. These smart contracts could automate various aspects of cross-border payments, further reducing manual intervention and the associated risk of errors. Additionally, smart contracts could unlock entirely new possibilities. Imagine a future where cross-border payments are automatically triggered upon the fulfillment of specific conditions – for instance, the release of funds upon verification of a shipment's arrival. The potential benefits of Project Agorá are far-reaching. Businesses of all sizes could experience significant cost savings and faster transaction times, potentially leading to increased trade and investment. Consumers could also benefit from faster and cheaper remittance services. However, Project Agorá faces several challenges. Regulatory hurdles remain, as central banks and governments grapple with the implications of tokenized money. Additionally, ensuring the security and stability of the shared ledger system will be paramount. Project Agorá is likely to be a multi-year undertaking, requiring close collaboration between central banks, private institutions, and technology providers. Despite the challenges, Project Agorá represents a significant step forward in the quest for a more efficient and transparent global financial system. By harnessing the power of new technologies, Project Agorá seeks to transform cross-border payments from a cumbersome relic of the past into a healthy digital marketplace – a modern-day Agora worthy of its namesake. The success of Project Agorá could have ramifications beyond just cross-border payments. The underlying technology could be adapted to streamline domestic payments within individual countries. Additionally, the project's exploration of tokenized money could inform future central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. Conclusion Project Agorá is a testament to the ongoing evolution of the global financial system. As technology continues to advance, we can expect further innovations that will reshape the way we conduct business and manage our finances. The once-arduous journey along the Silk Road may soon be a distant memory, replaced by a network of digital pathways that facilitate seamless and frictionless global commerce.

By tokenizing traditional forms of money – essentially creating digital representations of central bank reserves and commercial bank deposits – Project Agorá aims to establish a faster, more transparent system for cross-border payments. These digital tokens could be transferred near-instantaneously across a shared ledger, a secure digital record accessible to all authorized participants. This shared ledger would eliminate the need for multiple confirmations by intermediaries, significantly speeding up settlement times. But Project Agorá's ambitions extend beyond simply speeding up transactions. The project also explores the potential of smart contracts, self-executing agreements embedded within the shared ledger. These smart contracts could automate various aspects of cross-border payments, further reducing manual intervention and the associated risk of errors. Additionally, smart contracts could unlock entirely new possibilities. Imagine a future where cross-border payments are automatically triggered upon the fulfillment of specific conditions – for instance, the release of funds upon verification of a shipment's arrival. The potential benefits of Project Agorá are far-reaching. Businesses of all sizes could experience significant cost savings and faster transaction times, potentially leading to increased trade and investment. Consumers could also benefit from faster and cheaper remittance services. However, Project Agorá faces several challenges. Regulatory hurdles remain, as central banks and governments grapple with the implications of tokenized money. Additionally, ensuring the security and stability of the shared ledger system will be paramount. Project Agorá is likely to be a multi-year undertaking, requiring close collaboration between central banks, private institutions, and technology providers. Despite the challenges, Project Agorá represents a significant step forward in the quest for a more efficient and transparent global financial system. By harnessing the power of new technologies, Project Agorá seeks to transform cross-border payments from a cumbersome relic of the past into a healthy digital marketplace – a modern-day Agora worthy of its namesake. The success of Project Agorá could have ramifications beyond just cross-border payments. The underlying technology could be adapted to streamline domestic payments within individual countries. Additionally, the project's exploration of tokenized money could inform future central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. Conclusion Project Agorá is a testament to the ongoing evolution of the global financial system. As technology continues to advance, we can expect further innovations that will reshape the way we conduct business and manage our finances. The once-arduous journey along the Silk Road may soon be a distant memory, replaced by a network of digital pathways that facilitate seamless and frictionless global commerce.

    "article_summary": "Hong Kong's financial regulator has issued a warning to the public regarding an unlicensed virtual asset trading platform that is suspected of marketing services to investors without proper authorization. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) cautioned investors against trading on Sure X, highlighting the risks of potential losses due to platform failure, hacking, or misappropriation of assets. Sure X Added to SFC's Alert List Sure X is a virtual asset trading platform operating under various names, such as \"Sure Bit International Pte Ltd\" or \"Sure Bit International Ltd\". The SFC warned that investors might still find ways to access Sure X's websites and trading platform despite appearing to be inaccessible. The SFC wrote: \"While Sure X's platform websites appear to be inaccessible, the SFC notes that Hong Kong investors, through other means via the internet, may still be able to access the websites and/or the purported trading platform and register as new users.\" Last month, the SFC raised concerns over two other cryptocurrency trading platforms, HKCEXP and EDY, due to suspicions of fraudulent activities. According to a report by Finance Magnates, the SFC's investigations revealed that EDY falsely claims affiliation with a Hong Kong financial institution and a digital token system. Moreover, investors reported difficulties withdrawing funds from the platform, indicating potential malpractice. Similarly, HKCEXP operates with a fake Hong Kong address and falsely presents itself as an \"SFC-registered company.\" Thus, the securities watchdog warned investors against paying hefty fees to the platform under the pretext of facilitating withdrawals. Hong Kong Tightens Crypto Regulations Additionally, the SFC warned about Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange purportedly operating without the necessary licensing in Hong Kong. The regulator mentioned that Bybit's suspected unauthorized products, including futures contracts and leveraged tokens, pose significant financial risks to investors. In the aftermath of the scandal involving JPEX, the SFC is taking decisive action to safeguard investors. The regulator has rolled out a comprehensive set of measures aimed at enhancing transparency, bolstering public awareness, and tightening regulations surrounding crypto trading platforms. Hong Kong's foray into retail cryptocurrency trading in June 2023 brought with it a surge in opportunities for investors. However, it also exposed vulnerabilities in the regulatory framework, particularly regarding unlicensed trading platforms. To address this, the SFC published a detailed list of licensed Virtual Asset Trading Platforms on its website. Additionally, the watchdog is conducting a public awareness campaign to educate individuals about protecting themselves from potential fraud.

    "article_summary": "In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries, ChatGPT stands out as a versatile tool for professionals in all sorts of industries. However, the effectiveness of this tool largely depends on the quality of the prompts provided. This article delves into the art of prompt engineering for AI systems like ChatGPT, offering insights on how finance professionals in industries including forex, trading and more, can tailor their queries to derive maximum benefit. This is the third article in a series on ChatGPT, you can discover the intro here. As you’ll discover, I’m taking a course on leveraging the power of ChatGPT and I’m breaking it down for you as I go. Prompt engineering itself is a vast topic, so stay tuned for further articles as there’s much more to discuss. What is Prompt Engineering? Prompt engineering is the process of framing questions or commands to elicit the most relevant and precise responses from AI systems like ChatGPT, or Gemini. In the context of the finance industry, where accuracy and timeliness are paramount, mastering this skill is crucial. Defining Clear Objectives The first step in prompt engineering is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Whether it's generating market analysis reports or crafting financial advice, your goal should be specific. For instance, a well-structured prompt could be: “Provide a comprehensive analysis of the current trends in the EUR/USD pair over the last week, including potential market drivers.” \"But how do you best communicate your requirements to the LLM? This is where prompting comes in.\"Read more from Anand Subramanian's comprehensive introduction to prompt engineering. https://t.co/TwKroa9VbH — Towards Data Science (@TDataScience) March 26, 2024 Specifying Instructions Clarity is key. Specify the length, tone, and any other requirements for the content. For example, you might ask for a “500-word report, in a professional tone, detailing the impact of recent ECB policies on forex markets.” This ensures that the output has a good chance of meeting your editorial and professional standards. Contextualization Context is vital. Providing background information, scenarios, or examples helps ChatGPT understand the exact nature of your request. In the financial realm, context might include recent market events, specific analytical frameworks, or compliance guidelines relevant to your query. Best Practices in Prompt Engineering Custom Instructions ChatGPT offers the ability to set custom instructions reflecting your job, responsibilities, skills, and challenges. For finance professionals, this could mean tailoring prompts to focus on specific market sectors, regulatory environments, or investment strategies. These instructions will be used for every response ChatGPT gives, they’re essentially setting your expectations when it comes to answers. You can find these settings in your Profile, under “Customize ChatGPT”. Prompt Priming This prompting technique involves guiding ChatGPT to deliver better responses by offering more specific information. Instead of a vague request like “Provide marketing strategies,” you could ask, “What are the most effective digital marketing strategies for promoting ETFs to millennials in the current market?” The more information you can provide, the better. Iterative Dialogue Bearing the above in mind, remember to engage with ChatGPT in a conversational manner, refining and rephrasing your questions based on its responses. This iterative process helps in building a more nuanced understanding and receiving more tailored responses. Remember, you can edit and resubmit your query by hitting the pencil icon at the top of the conversation. So, ask ChatGPT to do something, review the result, and then edit the question / task again, Zero-to-Few Shot Prompting The level of specificity in any example you give ChatGPT influences the output. In some cases, offering no examples (zero-shot) can yield creative, general responses, while providing one or more specific examples (one-shot) can guide ChatGPT to produce more targeted content. “Few shot” refers to offering several examples. So, for example, you could ask it to write an article about solar panels, tell it length, objective, et cetera, but also copy-paste in the text from a source and ask it to cover the same topics, or to use the same tone. Practical Applications in the Financial Sector Market Analysis: By providing specific criteria and current market conditions, finance professionals can use ChatGPT to generate market analyses, but you’ll have to see how accurate / useful it is over time. And remember, check everything. Regulatory Compliance: ChatGPT can assist in understanding complex regulatory documents by asking it to summarize and highlight key compliance points relevant to certain financial activities. Client Communications: ChatGPT can be used to craft emails and newsletters quickly and easily. If you’re not convinced that it can handle the analysis, do it yourself, but have the software create the package through which it’s delivered. Training and Development: Finance professionals can use ChatGPT to create training materials on complex financial concepts by asking for simplified explanations or case study analyses. Effective prompt engineering in ChatGPT is a game-changer for professionals in the trading and forex industries. By mastering this skill, you can unlock the full potential of AI to enhance market analyses, client communication, regulatory compliance, and much more. Embrace this technology to stay competitive in the dynamic world of finance. But remember, read everything before you hit “send”. This article was written by Louis Parks at www.financemagnates.com.",

This came as, according to the local regulator, is “not authorized to sell or offer securities to the public in The Phillippines.” A Regulatory Advisory against eToro The Securities and Exchange Commission of The Philippines issued an advisory against the broker on March 14 but was published in the public domain yesterday (Thursday). According to the regulator of the South East Asian country, platforms offering securities and investment products in the country must ensure that the offered securities are locally registered, and issued by a locally registered corporation or dealer. Furthermore, the issuer must have a secondary license to sell or offer securities to the public. “Based on the Commission’s database, the operator of the platform eToro is not registered as a corporation in the Philippines and operates without the necessary license and/or authority to sell or offer any form of securities,” the advisory by the local regulator highlighted. “The public is hereby advised to exercise caution before investing in these kinds of unregistered online investment platforms and their representatives.” A Global Broker eToro is headquartered in Israel and is regulated and registered in some form or the other in the United Kingdom, Cyprus, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Malta, the UAE, Australia, Seychelles, the United States, and Gibraltar. The offerings of the platform ranges from equities to cryptocurrencies, and even contract for differences, along with other popular popular asset classes. The Filipino regulator pointed out that the broker does not have a license in the country, but was marketing its offerings to Fillipinos and even allowed them to open accounts. “eToro’s operations allow Filipinos to create user accounts on their platform for the purpose of investing and trading unregistered investment products,” the regulator added. However, eToro denied “actively promoting” its services in The Philippines. “eToro is regulated by financial regulatory authorities in multiple jurisdictions around the world and we take our legal and regulatory obligations very seriously. eToro has no local presence in the Philippines and we do not actively promote or market our services in the Philippines,\" a eToro spokesperson told Finance Magnates. Meanwhile, eToro is considering an initial public offering in the United States after a failed attempt for a reverse merger with a bank-check company. Although details of the supposed public listing is yet to be uncovered, its CEO, Yoni Assia, revealed that the company will aim for a valuation of over $3.5 billion.

    "article_summary": "Exness, a well-known forex and contracts for differences brokerage brand, reported the monthly trading volume for March to be $3.86 trillion, recovering from the previous month’s $3.53 trillion. It was a monthly increase of 9.3 percent. Strong Demand for a Broker Despite the recovery last month, the volumes remained marginally lower from $3.87 trillion the broker reported in January. Year-over-year, too, the monthly volumes remained almost flat as the figure was at $3.88 trillion in March 2023. Exness operates globally and has been aggressively expanding services in emerging markets like Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Cyprus-headquartered brokerage obtained licenses in South Africa and Kenya while establishing its first Latin American presence with an office in Uruguay. Trading demand on the platform peaked last October at $4.8 trillion. The broker, however, could not maintain the astronomical demand, as it corrected in the next consecutive months to $3.94 trillion and $3.61 trillion, respectively. Trading volume growth on Exness has been exponential over the years. Demand plummeted after the brokers followed the market to witness a sudden spike in March 2020 due to the pandemic's impacts. But then, gradually, it started to pick up, crossing the $1 trillion milestone in October 2021, $2 trillion in March 2022, $3 trillion in February 2023, and then $4 trillion in August 2023. A Record in Active Traders Although the latest monthly volume remained lower than the peak, the number of active clients at 836,873 on the platform hit a record. The figure jumped about 9.2 percent month-over-month. Interestingly, despite the ebb and flow of trading volume, the number of active clients on the platform maintained an almost consistent uptrend. Meanwhile, two top executives of Exness left the company in the past couple of months. Damian Bunce, who was the broker’s Chief Customer Officer, resigned in February and recently joined GTN as the CEO for Middle Eastern operations. Elena Krutova, the former Chief Administrative Officer at Exness, also moved recently to a pharmaceutical company. This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "article_summary": "And just like that our wallets have morphed from leather companions to lines of code. This newfound convenience, however, comes with a chilling reality: online transactions are a prime target for cybercriminals. The stakes are rising. Alarming projections indicate online payment fraud losses will surge in the coming years, potentially reaching billions with a projected growth rate exceeding 40% between 2023 and 2028. In 2022 alone, global losses reached $41 million, and experts predict a mind-numbing increase to $91 billion by 2028. The question, then, becomes a stark one: are our online payment methods fortresses safeguarding our financial security, or mere faucets spewing sensitive information into the vast digital unknown? Paying With the Right Card Our first line of defense lies in selecting the most secure payment methods. Credit cards, the longstanding champions of online commerce, offer a layer of protection as most reputable issuers employ fraud detection systems that monitor transactions for suspicious activity. As such, in the unfortunate event of unauthorized charges, the liability usually falls on the issuer, not you, minimizing financial losses. However, credit cards come with a caveat: the temptation to overspend. For those seeking stricter control, debit cards provide a direct link to your checking account, ensuring you don't stray beyond your means. Just remember, debit cards may offer less robust fraud protection compared to credit cards. Virtual credit cards, in turn, function as digital shields, offering a temporary layer of defense for your primary credit card information. Issued by some banks and financial institutions, these cards boast unique details like card numbers and CVVs, specifically generated for a single online purchase. This targeted approach minimizes the potential fallout from a data breach at an unfamiliar merchant. If a virtual card number falls into the wrong hands, the damage is contained, unlike a compromised traditional credit card. Additionally, virtual cards often come with the ability to set spending limits, further safeguarding you from impulsive online splurges. Lastly, there are always the underrated prepaid cards which actually offer a distinct advantage for budget-minded online shoppers. While not a direct substitute for traditional debit cards, prepaid cards provide a layer of privacy for online transactions. These allow you to load a specific amount of money beforehand, ensuring your spending stays firmly within the confines of your designated budget. Moreover, unlike debit cards that draw directly from your checking account, prepaid cards offer a safety net because if the card is lost or stolen, only the pre-loaded funds are vulnerable, thus minimizing financial losses. This characteristic can also be appealing for those who prefer to keep their online identity and bank account details separate. Digital Wallets and Why Encrypted Payments Matter For the truly security-conscious, digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay offer an extra layer of encryption. These innovative solutions tokenize your card information, creating a virtual substitute that merchants never see. This significantly reduces the risk of exposure if a data breach occurs. But are digital wallets a cure-all? Not quite. Their reliance on smartphones introduces a new vulnerability: physical security. Ensuring that your phone is shielded with a strong passcode and using additional authentication methods like fingerprint or facial recognition is crucial to those wanting to turn their devices into a veritable vault. How to Avoid Online Payment Scams Beyond payment methods, a keen eye is paramount in identifying and avoiding online scams. Phishing emails, disguised as legitimate communications from banks or retailers, are a common weapon in the scammer's arsenal. These emails often urge you to click on a malicious link or download an attachment that infects your device with malware, designed to steal your financial information. Here's the golden rule: Never click on links or open attachments in unsolicited emails, even if they appear to come from a trusted source. If an email raises suspicion, contact the sender directly through a verified phone number or website to confirm its legitimacy. Another red flag to watch for is unsolicited offers that seem too good to be true. If an online store advertises unbelievably low prices on popular items, it's likely a facade. Do your research before parting with your hard-earned cash. Read online reviews, check the merchant's website for legitimacy indicators like a physical address and contact information, and ensure the website utilizes a secure connection (look for the HTTPS prefix in the address bar). Remember, a healthy dose of skepticism is your best defense against online trickery. How to Pick the Best Passwords Now that you've chosen a secure payment method and honed your scam-detecting skills, let's fortify your digital defenses even further. Strong passwords are the cornerstone of online security. Resist the urge to reuse the same password across multiple accounts. Instead, create unique passwords for each platform, utilizing a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to generate and store these complex passwords securely. Other Vulnerabilities Furthermore, keeping your software up-to-date is critical. Software updates often include security patches that address newly discovered vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates on your devices and browsers to ensure you're always protected against the latest cyber threats. Anti-virus and anti-malware software are also essential tools. These programs constantly scan your device for malicious threats, providing an additional layer of protection. Finally, be mindful of where and how you conduct online transactions. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, as these are notoriously insecure. If an online purchase requires you to enter sensitive information, such as your credit card number, ensure you're on a secure website. Look for the padlock icon in the address bar and verify that the website address begins with HTTPS, indicating a secure connection. Conclusion Level up your payment security. Stay vigilant. Minimize damage. Protect your finances. By adopting these practices, you can transform your online transactions from a nerve-wracking experience into a secure and seamless process. Remember, online security is an ongoing journey, not a destination. This article was written by Pedro Ferreira at www.financemagnates.com.",
    "article_detailed_content": "And just like that our wallets have morphed from leather companions to lines of code. This newfound convenience, however, comes with a chilling reality: online transactions are a prime target for cybercriminals. The stakes are rising. Alarming projections indicate online payment fraud losses will surge in the coming years, potentially reaching billions with a projected growth rate exceeding 40% between 2023 and 2028. In 2022 alone, global losses reached $41 million, and experts predict a mind-numbing increase to $91 billion by 2028. The question, then, becomes a stark one: are our online payment methods fortresses safeguarding our financial security, or mere faucets spewing sensitive information into the vast digital unknown? Paying With the Right Card Our first line of defense lies in selecting the most secure payment methods. Credit cards, the longstanding champions of online commerce, offer a layer of protection as most reputable issuers employ fraud detection systems that monitor transactions for suspicious activity. As such, in the unfortunate event of unauthorized charges, the liability usually falls on the issuer, not you, minimizing financial losses. However, credit cards come with a caveat: the temptation to overspend. For those seeking stricter control, debit cards provide a direct link to your checking account, ensuring you don't stray beyond your means. Just remember, debit cards may offer less robust fraud protection compared to credit cards. Virtual credit cards, in turn, function as digital shields, offering a temporary layer of defense for your primary credit card information. Issued by some banks and financial institutions, these cards boast unique details like card numbers and CVVs, specifically generated for a single online purchase. This targeted approach minimizes the potential fallout from a data breach at an unfamiliar merchant. If a virtual card number falls into the wrong hands, the damage is contained, unlike a compromised traditional credit card. Additionally, virtual cards often come with the ability to set spending limits, further safeguarding you from impulsive online splurges. Lastly, there are always the underrated prepaid cards which actually offer a distinct advantage for budget-minded online shoppers. While not a direct substitute for traditional debit cards, prepaid cards provide a layer of privacy for online transactions. These allow you to load a specific amount of money beforehand, ensuring your spending stays firmly within the confines of your designated budget. Moreover, unlike debit cards that draw directly from your checking account, prepaid cards offer a safety net because if the card is lost or stolen, only the pre-loaded funds are vulnerable, thus minimizing financial losses. This characteristic can also be appealing for those who prefer to keep their online identity and bank account details separate. Digital Wallets and Why Encrypted Payments Matter For the truly security-conscious, digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay offer an extra layer of encryption. These innovative solutions tokenize your card information, creating a virtual substitute that merchants never see. This significantly reduces the risk of exposure if a data breach occurs. But are digital wallets a cure-all? Not quite. Their reliance on smartphones introduces a new vulnerability: physical security. Ensuring that your phone is shielded with a strong passcode and using additional authentication methods like fingerprint or facial recognition is crucial to those wanting to turn their devices into a veritable vault.

    "article_summary": "The world of credit just got a plot twist. Klarna, the BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) giant, tossed a grenade into the industry's usual game of hidden fees and opaque terms with their new initiative: Wikipink. This data-driven gambit aims to expose the inner workings of Klarna's system, but is it a genuine quest for transparency or a cleverly disguised marketing ploy? Let's dive into this data duel and see if it holds water. Klarna punches straight to the gut with statistics, painting a stark picture of responsible BNPL users versus credit card customers who seem perpetually stuck in a debt cycle. Their data boasts a late fee rate on their \"Pay in 4\" option that's a measly 4%, compared to the industry standard of a whopping 17%. Debt collectors become an endangered species with Klarna, with their debt collection rate staying under 2.5%, while some credit card companies might unleash the repo men after you miss a payment. In fact, Klarna's default rate ducks under 1%. Credit cards, on the other hand, are saddled with a much higher delinquency rate. Basically, Klarna users are more likely to settle their debts on time, becoming financially responsible rather than falling into delinquency. This focus on transparency extends beyond self-reported data. Klarna is proactively publishing transactional data, a move that some see as a bold step towards a more fact-based conversation about personal finance. Unlike traditional credit providers who are obligated by regulation to disclose similar data, Klarna's initiative goes beyond the legal minimum. This could be a significant development, as it encourages a shift from anecdotal evidence to concrete information when discussing credit options. But seasoned veterans in the payment industry might be eyeing this data with a suspicious squint as the long-term impact of BNPL options like Klarna remains to be seen. While the data suggests a potential reduction in debt, questions linger. Could BNPL simply create a new type of debt burden, albeit structured differently from traditional credit cards? The impact on credit scores and future borrowing needs further exploration. Additionally, as the BNPL market expands, regulatory changes might be on the horizon. Will stricter regulations be necessary to ensure responsible lending practices within the BNPL sector? Klarna's Wikipink initiative has undoubtedly sparked a conversation about the future of credit. Whether this translates to a financial revolution for consumers or simply a shift in the credit landscape remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear: transparency is a vital component of a healthy financial ecosystem. By promoting a data-driven approach to credit education and encouraging responsible consumer behavior, initiatives like Wikipink could empower individuals to take control of their financial well-being. As the credit industry evolves, Klarna's data-driven approach has thrown a spotlight on the potential benefits of transparency and responsible BNPL usage. This focus on clarity could pave the way for a future where informed consumers and ethical lending practices become the norm. Klarna's Wikipink might just be the first shot in a data war between credit card companies and BNPL providers. One thing's for sure: the credit industry is about to be rewritten. Wikipink might just be the spark that ignites a revolution for responsible credit use and financially empowered consumers. So, let's pay close attention, because this financial frontier is about to get a whole lot more interesting. This article was written by Pedro Ferreira at www.financemagnates.com.",

    "article_summary": "The click. It's the sound of success, the confirmation that a customer has entrusted you with their hard-earned money. But before that symphony of satisfaction plays out, a silent yet crucial transaction occurs – the invisible gatekeeper, the payment gateway, swings open. The e-commerce landscape is booming, but with every click comes a hidden threat. A staggering $38 billion was lost to fraud in 2023, with projections reaching a chilling $91 billion by 2028. Over the next five years, merchant losses are expected to reach a cumulative total of $362 billion. In this high-stakes game, a secure and efficient payment gateway is your shield – the silent defender of your bottom line. But with so many options, choosing the right one can feel like deciphering a financial code. How to Choose the Best Payment Gateway The first step is self-discovery so you should begin with introspection. What is the beating heart of your business? Are you a nimble online storefront or a brick-and-mortar haven with a loyal following? Do you specialize in high-volume, low-cost transactions, or cater to a discerning clientele with infrequent, high-value purchases? Identifying your business model is the cornerstone for selecting the ideal payment partner. Simplicity First: Gateways for the Streamlined Startup For e-commerce newcomers or businesses venturing online, user-friendliness is paramount. Gateways like PayPal and Square offer intuitive interfaces and streamlined setups, allowing for quick integration with minimal technical expertise. PayPal, a household name with a vast user base, fosters instant customer recognition and trust. Square, on the other hand, excels in mobile transactions, transforming your smartphone into a powerful POS system for on-the-go sales at festivals or pop-up events. How to Find the Lowest Payment Fees for Your Business Finding the cheapest payment gateway is often a game of cost vs. predictability. Payment gateway fees typically fall into two categories: flat monthly fees and per-transaction charges. For businesses with predictable sales volume, a flat-fee gateway like Payment Depot offers stability and budgeting ease. However, for the business with a more unpredictable sales cycle, per-transaction fees might be a better fit. Remember, with gateways like Stripe and PayPal that utilize this structure, processing rates typically hover around 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Are Subscription Models Worth It? A Look Into Recurring Revenue The subscription model is a burgeoning force within e-commerce. If your business thrives on recurring payments, a gateway like Stax Payments becomes your secret weapon. Stax offers robust subscription management tools and competitive \"cents-per-transaction\" fees, ensuring a smooth and cost-effective experience for both you and your loyal customers. Catering to the Global Village: A World of Payment Options In today's interconnected world, offering a variety of payment options is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity. Gateways like Paysafe shine in this arena, seamlessly integrating with a diverse array of payment methods, from digital wallets like Apple Pay to international giants like Alipay. This flexibility caters to a wider customer base and unlocks your full earning potential. Security Matters: Building Trust with Every Transaction Protecting your customer's financial information is paramount. As such, look for a payment gateway that prioritizes robust security measures and adheres to industry-standard PCI compliance regulations. Having robust payment reporting and analytics in place while in tandem being able to offer a comprehensive suite of security features, will give you and your customers peace of mind. Advanced Functionality: Powering Complex Businesses For businesses with intricate needs, a gateway with advanced functionalities might be the missing puzzle piece. Gateways like Adyen provide omnichannel solutions, allowing you to seamlessly integrate payments across your online store, physical locations, and even mobile apps. This level of sophistication caters to larger businesses with a complex sales infrastructure. The payment gateway landscape caters to specific industries as well. Clover, for instance, caters to single-location businesses like cafes or salons, offering a POS system specifically tailored to their requirements. Similarly, Braintree excels at integrating with digital wallets, making it a perfect fit for businesses heavily reliant on mobile payments. The Payment Gateway Cheat Sheet: Choosing Your Champion: The Final Move Remember, the ideal payment gateway becomes an integral part of your business ecosystem. Research different options, consider your specific needs, and don't hesitate to leverage free trials offered by many providers. By carefully evaluating your business model, transaction volume, budget, and future growth, you'll be well-equipped to select the champion that propels your business forward and unlocks your full earning potential.

    "article_summary": "Coinbase, the international cryptocurrency exchange, has achieved a milestone in its expansion efforts by becoming officially registered as a restricted dealer by the Canadian Securities Administrators. With this development, Coinbase has become the first international cryptocurrency exchange to be registered in Canada. Compliance Highlighted amid Canadian Registration Process The registration process, which has been in progress since March 2023, underscores Coinbase's focus on regulatory compliance. Through close collaboration with Canadian regulators, Coinbase has worked to establish a policy framework. Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, expressed appreciation for the efforts of Canadian regulators in bringing clarity to the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Coinbase has engaged with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to facilitate their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset landscape. A recent survey conducted by Coinbase in partnership with Angus Reid revealed that a significant majority of Canadians (72%) view the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges as important. Furthermore, nearly a third of Canadians (29%) indicated that they would be more inclined to buy cryptocurrency if there were more regulations in place.

The registration as a Restricted Dealer represents one of several steps taken by Coinbase to expand its presence in Canada, including the official launch in August 2023 and the establishment of a Canadian tech hub. The registration in Canada adds to Coinbase's growing list of registrations in key countries, including France, Spain, Singapore, Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Manhattan has allowed the US Securities and Exchange Commission to proceed with a lawsuit against Coinbase, despite dismissing one claim. The decision sets the stage for a potentially lengthy legal battle, marking a notable development in the ongoing regulatory scrutiny of digital assets firms.

    "article_detailed_content": "Coinbase, the international cryptocurrency exchange, has achieved a milestone in its expansion efforts by becoming officially registered as a restricted dealer by the Canadian Securities Administrators. With this development, Coinbase has become the first international cryptocurrency exchange to be registered in Canada. Compliance Highlighted amid Canadian Registration Process The registration process, which has been in progress since March 2023, underscores Coinbase's focus on regulatory compliance. Through close collaboration with Canadian regulators, Coinbase has worked to establish a policy framework. Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, expressed appreciation for the efforts of Canadian regulators in bringing clarity to the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, Coinbase has engaged with Canadian banks, investment advisors, and pension funds to facilitate their successful navigation of the evolving digital asset landscape. A recent survey conducted by Coinbase in partnership with Angus Reid revealed that a significant majority of Canadians (72%) view the regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges as important. Furthermore, nearly a third of Canadians (29%) indicated that they would be more inclined to buy cryptocurrency if there were more regulations in place.

The company attributed this growth to strong activity across various asset classes and market volatility. Additionally, the recent acquisition of r8fin has positively contributed to Treasury volumes, enhancing the firm's market presence. March 2024 Milestones Notably, the average daily volume (ADV) on Tradeweb reached a new peak at $1.81 trillion, highlighting the company's robust performance amidst dynamic market conditions. Tradeweb’s CEO, Billy Hult, mentioned: \"Our strong volumes across asset classes in March 2024 punctuated a record quarter for Tradeweb. Market volatility remained front and center for our clients, resulting in strong volumes and continued market share gains across our global asset classes.\" In the European credit segment, Tradeweb recorded a notable boost in ADV, underscoring confidence among clients on the electronic trading platform. Additionally, the global repurchase agreement ADV experienced remarkable growth due to the increasing adoption of Tradeweb's trading protocols. Today we reported total March 2024 trading volume of $36.2tn and average daily volume of $1.81tn. For the first quarter of 2024, total trading volume was $116.9tn and average daily volume was a record $1.90tn.

Its ADV rose 39.1% YoY, reaching a record $1.9 trillion. Notable ADV figures for US government bonds, European government bonds, and swaps were among the achievements. Tradeweb recorded a significant increase in US government bond ADV, European government bond ADV, and mortgage ADV. The platform's institutional business experienced strong trading volumes, with contributions from the acquisition of r8fin. Credit and Money Market Segments For the credit markets, Tradeweb recorded significant growth in fully electronic US credit ADV and European credit ADV. Similarly, equities markets experienced a substantial expansion, with increased ADV in US and European ETFs. This reflects a growing institutional and wholesale client engagement. Tradeweb's repurchase agreement ADV experienced a boost of 29% YoY in the money market sector. This upturn was fueled by heightened client engagement in Tradeweb's electronic repo trading protocols. In January, Tradeweb finalized its acquisition of r8fin, a technology provider known for its algorithmic-based execution in US Treasuries and interest rate futures. This move, announced in November 2023, is expected to boost Tradeweb's capabilities in electronic trading and expand its reach in the algorithmic trading landscape. According to a report by Finance Magnates, the integration of r8fin's intelligent execution tools into Tradeweb's platform is expected to provide clients with a comprehensive approach to trading US Treasury bonds and related futures.

    "article_detailed_content": "Pitbull is a popular crypto token on Binance Smart Chain; it is hyper deflationary auto-staking token that reflects 2% of transactions to all users Understanding Pitbull It is described as a self-managed token and connected product ecosystem developed on the Binance Smart Chain. It is designed on the idea of “meme coins” and money for dog charity.” Its objective is very complex. Pitbull has sophisticated tokenomics with a consistent token-burning system and blockchain liquidity. It was developed as a social experiment for a cryptocurrency community to come together and build an ecosystem of value with centralized guidance or authority. Pitbull portrays itself as a community-owned crypto token. It does not come from developers’ or founders’ wallets. Its token, known as the PIT token, is an intelligent contract token that cannot be edited or accessed. It has burned 50% of the initial supply. Development and History of Pitbull It was launched on March 17, 2021, at Binance Smart Chain as a BEP-20 token. Its initial token supply was all-volunteer and was conducted without a presale. The community created a community-funded multi-signature wallet to fund exchange listings and other initiatives. All the transactions were transparent and usually go to community-approved causes. The website represents various community leaders, including Jack, Jari, Faab, Max, Mer, G, Azerun, and others. The community leaders are responsible for engineering and communication. The remaining responsibilities are distributed among the trustworthy teams of dozens of volunteers. Their primary duties include raising awareness, getting partners, and working on the code. Understanding PIT The tokenomics for the PIT token consists of two supply regulation mechanisms: reflections and burning. 2% of total token turnover is redistributed among holders through self-provisioning rewards involving dead addresses. 2% of total buy-sell transactions go into a forever-closed liquidity wallet with no centralized access. Initially, 100 quadrillion PIT tokens were minted, out of which 50 quadrillion, or half, were immediately sent to a black hole. As per the tokenomics of PIT, it is a deflationary token, and its circulating supply is decreased from the reflections, leading to burning as its reduction percentage in the circulating supply constantly increases. Usage of PIT One of the distinguishing features of Pitbull is itself-staking, which simply refers to holding PIT enough to generate returns and rewards from transaction fees and reflections. The quantity of PIT held determines the share of the reward. Holding PIT allows users access to a particular subscription on PitSafe. It includes features ranging from insights into Binance Smart Chain tokens to early access to discover opportunities at PitSafe. Other ecosystems also support payment in PIT. The holders are recommended to hold tokens until the NFT farm and Play-to-Earn games are launched in the ecosystem. In addition, it has planned to create an automated tool to facilitate donations and charities that will help pit bulls and other dogs, such as Kennel to Couch and Bullies in Need, to name a few. This feature allows users to donate directly to PIT without waiting for implementation. Comparison of Pitbull with other similar projects The most obvious competitor is Dogecoin because it was the first meme coin to start the digital dog money family. DOGE was also created to develop a crypto community rather than profitability. At the time of the launch of Dogecoin, the developers, however, were required to come together to launch a unique blockchain. Its existence on the BNB chain makes it more compatible with other coins available on similar blockchain ecosystems. Another appropriate comparison is between Shiba Inu and Pitbull. These projects are social experiments to observe how users can build value. The Shiba Inu also burns half of its supply, as these were sent to Vitalik Buterin as a token of appreciation for the team. Buterin decided to donate a part as a charity and the rest. However, the creators of Pitbull decided not to tag it with the name and fame of a celebrity. Future of Pitbull Pitbull is a project with forward-looking plans. Source: Pitbull.community In the coming years, the community and dedicated team will have control over PitMag, exchange listings, merchandise, partnerships, and donation campaigns. The development of new dApps will keep coders and engineers busy. dApps include PriceBot, PitDiscovery, PitStore, and NFT infrastructure. @BscPitbull is NOW LISTED on @Changehero_io Users can now exchange $PIT with 100+ tokens/coins, at the best rate and with no sign-ups here https://t.co/PYo1HAV1M1#PIT – an auto-staking token that had its ownership renounced and burnt LP given to the community#BNB pic.twitter.com/Ge08Dg1Cge — BSCDaily (@bsc_daily) October 26, 2022 A user can probably guess that ChangeHero has added Pitbull for instant crypto swaps. It would be interesting if crypto users in the Pitbull community could develop a new way of getting PIT easily and quickly. Bitkan also researched Pitbull and confirmed its trustworthiness. Conclusion: Selection of Wallet PIT is a token on the BSC chain with the BEP20 standard. It can be accessed, managed, and stored in any wallet that supports BEP20 standards. This standard’s most commonly used wallets include browser extensions to mobile wallet apps such as MetaMask, TrustWallet, or KleverApp. Users of browser extensions should download the extension from official sources. It is recommended to double-check the URLs of the links a user visits because the websites of fraudsters can absorb all the values and empty users’ wallets if these wallets are connected. FAQs If Pitbull is a metaverse coin? The community is built on a play-to-earn and help game center for Web3 and metaverse use. What is the average transition time for a Pitbull transaction? It usually takes between 5 and 30 minutes to process a transaction if a user chooses currencies with a speedy recovery.",
