  "article_detailed_content": "Coinbase did not hold back about a letter that contained information which was pushing the SEC to hold any more crypto ETFs. According to Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase the direct evidence shows that Ether’s futures and spot markets are as correlated as Bitcoin. This letter suggests that the recent letter by the US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, rejecting any further crypto ETF applications is misguided. In response to a letter from two US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs even more and reject any further crypto ETF applications, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal criticized the senator’s claims. What Was in This Letter? The letter, dated March 11, claimed that approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to “enormous risks”. Grewal said that the senators’ letter contained several falsehoods, and he argued that the evidence pointed in the opposite direction. He explained that the market for many cryptocurrencies smaller than Bitcoin, notably Ether, demonstrated quality metrics that exceeded even the largest traded equities. Grewal added that the spot market for Ether is deep and liquid, with only two S&P 500 stocks having higher notional dollar trading volume. Additionally, there was direct evidence that Ether’s futures and spot markets were just as correlated as Bitcoin’s. The letter from the senators, Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, claimed that approving any further crypto ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission would see investors exposed to thinly traded markets rife with fraud and manipulation. However, there are currently eight proposed spot Ether ETF applications awaiting approval by the SEC, and there have been hopes that other altcoins could eventually walk the same path. The Senators Urged the SEC to Hold the Approval The SEC has been urged by the senators to avoid setting a precedent for further approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about the market’s recent weakness. Moreover, they argued that while Bitcoin’s market has undergone serious scrutiny, it is more reliable and established than the market for smaller cryptocurrencies. The SEC is under pressure to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF brokers and advisors. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasing political pressure on Gensler, making an Ether ETF approval in May less likely. Moreover, Both Butler and Reed have sponsored legislation to crackdown on cryptocurrency. In addition to this, Coinbase and Grayscale met with SEC officials on March 9 to discuss a rule change for the launch of spot Ether ETFs. The SEC may reject pending ETH ETFs based on “correlation.” Some believe the SEC’s pushback on Ether ETFs is political, not intended to “protect investors.” Summary Coinbase has criticized a letter from Senators that claimed approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to ‘enormous risks’. Crypto industry pundit, Balchunas, said that the letter was evidence of mounting political pressure on Gensler, which makes an Ether ETF approval in May seem less likely.

  "article_detailed_content": "Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies’ popularity has suddenly surged globally. Bitcoin is the only crypto dominating over 50% of the market. A major difference is seen post spot ETFs approval. Bitcoin (BTC), the market pioneer, has most recently traded at its all-time high. However, the spike game was over in a few hours. When writing, it was trading at $67,983, with an intraday decline of 7.41%. BTC’s highest trading price is $73,750, achieved on March 14, 2024. The price at press time was 8.33% lesser. According to CoinMarketCap, there are 42.09 Million addresses that hold $0- $1k Bitcoins. However, the number of wallets that hold $100k BTC is 683.61k. Compared to other years in 2024, a significant boost has been observed in the total number of Bitcoin holders. As of March 12, 2024, there were 452.61k whales holdings, 1.70 Million Investors, and 17.51 Million retail. There has been a neck-to-neck competition between Binance and Coinbase for Bitcoin trading volume for the past few years. Binance is the highest Bitcoin trading volume contributor in spots, and Bitunix leads the perpetual trading of BTC. In the past few years, a primary pump in the market capitalization of Bitcoin has been seen; when writing, it was $1.33 Trillion. Between March 13 and 14, the market cap of the most prominent crypto firm reached $1.44 Trillion. Reason Behind Downfall! Despite an inflow of funds in the Bitcoin ecosystem from spot ETF, a significant outflow of funds has been observed in the past few days. BitMEX Research observed that the Grayscale spot ETF has suffered a severe outflow for the past few months. However, a record outflow of funds was seen on March 11, 2024, when Bitcoin peaked. In the early days of approval, the spot ETF gathered significant attention, and billions of dollars were injected into the BTC ecosystem. Moreover, thousands of news addresses have started holding Bitcoin since January 2024. Quarterly Bitcoin Hashrate Report The Bitcoin hash rate has surged significantly in the past three months and reached 780.17 EH/s on March 07, 2024. The record was one of the highest hashrate in one quarter. Source: Blockchain As per the whitepaper, Bitcoin’s hashrate is the calculated value that specifies an estimate of how much hashrate is being generated by Bitcoin miners trying to solve the pending Bitcoin block or any other block. In simple words, Bitcoin hashrate calculates the difficulty of solving an individual block. On February 26, a significant spike in the hash rate was seen when it suddenly reached above 700 EH/s from 631.2389 EH/s a day earlier. The hashrate is measured in units Hash (H/s), KiloHash (kH/s), MegaHash(MH/s), GigaHash (GH/s), TeraHash (TH/s), PetaHash (PH/s), ExaHash (EH/s), ZettaHash (ZH/s) and YottaHash (YH/s) is the highest measurement unit.

  "article_detailed_content": "Berachain has emerged as a leading DeFi company in the past few quarters. Blockchain technology’s rapid evolution and advancement have lured global investors into supporting blockchain-backed companies. Berachain, a DeFi-focused, EVM-compatible Layer 1 built on the Cosmos SDK and proof of liquidity consensus, raised $69 Million in funding. The funding round was co–led by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures. A Bloomberg report states that the project is raising money by offering digital tokens, which will be valued at $1.5 Billion. In the past few years, a significant shift of interest has been seen in funding crypto. The report further states that Berachain is the only company that secured unicorn states during the ongoing bull run. Other than co-led in funding, OKX ventures, Robot Ventures, Shima Capital, Hack VC, Tribe Capital, and Polychain, among others. Other Major Funding Since January 2024 Since January 1, 2024, EigenLayer and Hashkey Group have only raised $100 Million. Optimism has secured $89 Million in funding, and Zama gathered $73 Million in a Series-A round. Over this period, most projects that have received funding are based on the Ethereum blockchain. Portal, a DeFi project, has raised $34 Million in its seed funding round, followed by Ether(dot)Fi $27 Million. The first quarter of 2024 is on the brink of being completed, and to date, over 351 founding rounds have occurred, and several companies collectively secured $2,005,891,315. Investors Ranking Per Funding Rounds OKX Ventures has invested in more than 32 companies in the past 180 days, and HashKey Capital has injected funds in 26 rounds. Big Brain Holdings and Foresight Ventures have participated in 22 funding rounds. HashKey Capital has topped the list in making investments in the past 365 days as it is invested in 51 firms. Coinbase Ventures did not lock any major funding deals in YTD, but it has invested in 366 companies since its foundation. Crypto Market Price Update The fear and greed index of CoinMarketCap shows extreme greed, with 87 points, which might lead to bearishness in the market. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies slips 6.47% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, the market leader, marked a new all-time high at $73,750; the price failed to sustain higher for a longer time. As of writing, BTC was trading at $67,804, with an intraday decline of 6.83%. According to several market analysts, the significant increase in the trading price in the past few days is due to the massive outflow from the Bitcoin ecosystem. Similarly, the second most talked about cryptocurrency in the market has declined approximately 6.30% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin SV tops the intraday loser list as its price slips 20.49%, Bonk (BONK) lost 16.26%, Injective (INJ) 16.26%, Mantle (MNT) 15.13% and Shiba Inu (SHIB) 13.36%. Conflux (CFX) grew 8.02% in the past 24 hours, which makes it the leader of the past 24 hours gainers list, followed by Fetch.ai (FET) at 5.20%, Sei (SEI) at 3.27%, 0x Protocol (ZRX) at 3.17% and UNUS SED LEO (LEO) 1.59% including others.

  "article_detailed_content": "Investing in new cryptocurrencies is the most widespread strategy for entering crypto markets. Beginners constantly look for low-cap platforms to invest in, hoping to acquire large amounts of tokens at a low price. This strategy has significant benefits and is less risky, but it’s not entirely proven in any way, as many emerging cryptos often fail before the gains even begin. However, if a new platform gets enough backing from investors in the earliest stages and offers excellent utility, it can result in high short and long-term gains. That brings us to Green Bitcoin, an engaging new platform with a hugely successful presale event. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< Green Bitcoin – Predict-to-Earn Staking Platform Showing Massive Potential Green Bitcoin is an upcoming cryptocurrency that has excited thousands of investors. It entered presale recently and is already showing clear signs of explosive growth. It’s primarily a staking platform with a unique Predict-to-Earn reward system that allows users to earn native $GBTC tokens by predicting future Bitcoin prices. Its release will coincide with the next Bitcoin halving event, giving users another option to get higher returns during the upcoming bull run. Green Bitcoin is a gamified green staking platform with high sustainability, and it will be the next big crypto to explode in the upcoming period. It’s built on the Ethereum blockchain, so it’s compatible with all ETH-based crypto wallets. Earn $GBTC Tokens Using Your Gut Feeling The unique Predict-to-Earn reward system allows users to earn $GBTC tokens using their gut feeling regarding future Bitcoin prices. It’s an excellent choice for beginners and experienced traders, as it offers a simple platform for earning tokens with or without trading experience. Once you buy $GBTC tokens during the ongoing presale, you can stake them to earn up to 118% returns before the first listing. After the platform goes live, you can earn even more tokens using various price prediction strategies and approaches. However, before you can place any predictions, you must stake a number of your $GBTC. Then, you have to wait until the staking period is over, and if your predictions are correct, you earn higher $GBTC returns. >>>Buy Green Bitcoin Now<<< Green Bitcoin Token Presale The platform entered presale a few weeks ago and has already raised over $4.3 million, showing clear signs of growing demand and a positive market sentiment. The platform has a total of 21 million tokens, but only 50% is available during the event. It’s just a few weeks of going live, and considering that the presale hard cap is set to $7 million, you only have a few more days to get into the action early. Moreover, if you buy $GBTC tokens during the presale, you can stake them for up to 118% rewards before the first listings. Details to Look For When Investing In New Cryptocurrencies Understanding how to recognize new cryptocurrencies that have the potential to result in higher returns is essential for your success as a digital asset trader. Crypto markets are generally highly volatile and unpredictable, so you should take everything with a grain of salt. That said, there are a few details or signs you should look for when trying to identify cryptos that are the most likely to explode after release. 1. Demand and Supply The first rule of cryptocurrencies is demand and supply. The price of all cryptocurrencies is determined by two primary factors: availability and popularity. Bitcoin is an excellent example. When its demand spiked in 2017, Bitcoin went from $1 to $20,000 in less than 12 months. The same applies to any other cryptocurrency. Limited supply combined with increased demand is what drives prices higher over time. If the two factors work together, the asset’s price can explode, resulting in exponential growth and high returns. Things work the other way around, so token prices will likely decrease significantly if the supply and demand are too high. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< 2. Technological Factors Many cryptos gain value after providing more details on project development, including future roadmaps, updates, and partnerships with other projects. A significant increase in funding, an appearance on Tier 1 exchange listings, etc., can trigger explosive growth. Such information often sparks investor confidence, resulting in high gains in a short period. 3. Market Sentiment Sometimes, the buzz surrounding a cryptocurrency can also result in high gains. For example, when Elon Musk Tweeted about Dogecoin in 2019, the token exploded almost immediately, resulting in a massive bull run. However, sometimes influencers use their social presence to manipulate market sentiment, resulting in artificial price increases that usually don’t last very long. 4. Regulatory Changes Cryptocurrency markets are still largely unregulated, so new regulations and policies imposed by governments can also affect token prices. Rising interest rates and deteriorating macroeconomic parameters almost always negatively affect crypto prices. However, as the FED reduces interest rates, more investors are willing to invest in digital assets, resulting in steady price increases across the entire crypto market. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< Wrapping Up Green Bitcoin is getting more support by the day and is quickly rising above many other platforms going live in the next few months. It’s one of the most anticipated cryptos in 2024, and the next platform will likely explode in the next few months. The demand for $GBTC tokens is growing exponentially, and it will go live right around the next crypto bull run following the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Visit the official Green Bitcoin site and stake your $GBTC tokens for 118% rewards. Jump on the Green Bitcoin train early to get the highest returns in the next few months.

  "article_detailed_content": "Solana Solana is trading at 180.72 increasing by nearly 4% on Friday. The recent surge in Solana (SOL) prices can be attributed to the explosive rise of meme coin excitement, notably propelled by Dogewhatif (WIF). WIF’s astonishing $700,000 fundraising success, far surpassing its $50,000 goal, spurred a 25% price surge and boasted a $3 billion market cap. This fervor directly influenced SOL’s impressive 24% price hike. $WIF the @dogwifcoin will be shown for a week on the Las Vegas Sphere after a $700,000 funding campaign.#memecoin #crypto #dog pic.twitter.com/loGPtLnnvd — Cool Crypto (@CCoolCrypto) March 15, 2024 The surge in activity isn’t just about memes; it reflects the underlying strength of Solana’s network, evidenced by a record total-value-locked (TVL) of 23.07 million SOL, the highest since December 2022. WIF’s fundraising feat ignites a 24% Solana (SOL) price hike. Solana’s network demonstrates robustness with a record TVL. The rise in meme coin popularity reflects on Solana’s growing DeFi potential. As Solana continues to distinguish itself with lightning-fast transactions and minimal fees, it becomes a hotbed for meme coin mania. WIF’s connection to Solana’s robust infrastructure amplifies its appeal, potentially positioning it beyond meme status and into the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). While debates over its long-term viability persist, the surge in SOL prices underscores the growing influence of meme coins within the crypto-verse. Solana’s Value Soars with Bitcoin’s Rally and Growing Confidence in Its Ecosystem Solana’s (SOL) remarkable price surge resonates with the broader cryptocurrency market uplift, led by Bitcoin’s ascent to record highs above $72,000. This bullish wave, further amplified by the approval of Bitcoin-centric ETFs and ETPs in major markets, has injected a fresh dose of optimism across the crypto sector. The consequential spike in investment flow highlights a growing appetite among investors for digital assets. Breaking News: #Bitcoin just hit a new all-time high of $70,500!#BTC #ATH pic.twitter.com/5Erc9dX7w8 — Next 100X GEMS (@Next100XGEMS) March 11, 2024 Bitcoin’s rally to new highs triggers a broader market optimism, benefitting SOL. The SOL/BTC pair’s 32.45% climb signifies a growing investor shift towards Solana. Solana gains momentum from meme coin activity, potentially enhancing its market value. The evident shift towards Solana, driven by a quest for alternatives offering stability and innovation, marks a notable confidence boost in its ecosystem. Coupled with the meme coin frenzy within Solana’s platform, these factors contribute to its increasing appeal and potential for further appreciation. Jupiter’s Success on Solana Bolsters DeFi and Meme Coin Ecosystem Jupiter, a prominent DeFi project within the Solana ecosystem, has showcased impressive performance by surpassing Uniswap V3 in data processing volume. Experiencing a 67% increase since March 6, Jupiter’s resilience shines through, especially with the introduction of its Value-Average (Beta) feature. Solana-based Jupiter posts hefty returns amidst meme coin rally – by @FXstreetNewshttps://t.co/ZGRxxpnzVp #Solana #CryptoCurrencies — FXStreet Crypto (@FXScrypto) March 15, 2024 This feature’s success illustrates the platform’s robustness, even amid initial price volatility post-launch. Jupiter surpasses Uniswap V3, showcasing Solana’s DeFi prowess. Meme coin launches, like WEN, thrive on Solana’s LFG Launchpad, indicating rising market confidence. Jupiter’s valuation hits $1.27 billion, underlining growing trust in Solana’s ecosystem. The surge in meme coins, including Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF), alongside Jupiter’s achievements, highlight the expanding allure of Solana’s ecosystem. This expansion not only elevates Jupiter but also enhances Solana’s reputation as a burgeoning hub for DeFi and meme coin activities. The escalating trust and investment in projects like Jupiter signal a bright future for Solana, potentially attracting more users and investors, thereby elevating SOL’s value in the cryptocurrency market. Solana Price Prediction As of this analysis, Solana (SOL/USD) is experiencing a slight retreat, trading at $181.57, down by 1.27%. The pivot point for SOL, represented by the green line, is placed at $181.57, which could act as a decisive level for future price movements. The currency is currently at a critical juncture, brushing against immediate resistance levels at $188.69, $201.35, and $214.81, which may impede further upward progress. Solana Price Prediction The asset finds immediate support at $170.07, with deeper safety nets at $158.56 and $149.35, providing crucial zones to cushion any potential declines. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $157.42, offering a longer-term perspective on the asset’s momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.96, hovering near overbought territory, which could signal a possible consolidation or reversal if traders perceive SOL as overvalued at current levels. In conclusion, the overall trend for Solana suggests a moment of balance.

  "article_detailed_content": "Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXTools On a day that crypto markets succumb to profit-taking, traders are turning to the on-chain shitcoin markets in order to hunt for top crypto gainers today that could deliver quick profits. Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700. Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge spot Bitcoin ETF demand. But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind. The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and PPI inflation figures. Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. If the blue-chip markets are going to spend the next few weeks consolidating/falling, on-chain shitcoin markets all of a sudden become more attractive. On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top an existing blockchain. For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges, and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough. They are often referred to as shitcoin markets because virtually anyone can issue a token at any time. As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes. Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener MindAI ($MDAI) An AI shitcoin called MindAI ($MDAI) is up 6,753% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. That makes it the top crypto gainer today on Ethereum. Its market cap was last around $1.2 million, with just over $250,000 in locked liquidity. Potential investors should be very cautious of this coin though, given five concerning aspects to its smart contract. These include; a modifiable tax, pausable transfers, a 5% buy and sell tax and a whitelist function. COCO ($COCO) A shitcoin called Coco is up 1,800% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener, making it a top crypto gainer today. Its market cap was last $3 million, with $274,000 in locked liquidity. It also has no smart contract issues. But even if the token doesn’t look like a scam, shitcoins are all still very risky. The token is probably still a pump-and-dump scam. There is no such thing as zero risk in the shitcoin market. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

  "article_detailed_content": "Cryptocurrencies like JUP, CFX, SOL compete for best crypto to buy today Image by cryptonews.com On a day that crypto markets succumb to profit-taking, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy in order to benefit from the recent market dip. Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700. Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge spot Bitcoin ETF demand. But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind. The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and PPI inflation figures. Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. That suggests it probably isn’t one of the best crypto to buy today. But other altcoins have continued to pump. Here are some top performers that traders will be watching and could be the best crypto to buy today. Best Crypto to Buy Today Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter (JUP), Solana’s biggest decentralized exchange, is pumping on Friday, having rallied 23.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. The token just hit fresh record highs above $1.2, giving it a market cap of $1.6 billion. It’s fully diluted market cap is $12.17 billion. That’s about $1 billion lower than Uniswap’s fully diluted market cap, the most well-established of the DEXs. For reference, Uniswap’s circulating market cap was last around $7.8 billion. The cryptocurrency hit a market cap $22.6 billion in 2021, so could easily 3x from here. Jupiter, as the Solana ecosystem leader, could see even larger gains. That’s why it ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Conflux (CFX) Conflux (CFX) is one of the top performers today, up 18.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. CFX has its sights set on challenging the early 2023 highs in the $0.49 area. If it can break above here, a quick surge towards late-2021 highs around $0.84 is on the cards. The prospect of near-term 2x upside means CFX could easily be the best crypto to buy today. Solana (SOL) In fitting with the pump in the token of its largest DEX, Solana (SOL) is also up big on Friday. SOL was last higher by about 7% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap. Last above $180, SOL is bearing down on its 2021 highs $260 region. Another 50% rally from current levels is easily possible for the token, ranking it as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make solid gains. While the future is always uncertain in crypto, these names could be among the best crypto to buy today. However, those looking for a better probability of near-term gains should consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy—getting involved in crypto presales. Presales offer investors a routine to get involved in a project at its very early stages, and thus potentially make returns of as much as 100x. If investors can identify projects with solid foundation, the risk/reward of their investment is very good. Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time examining new presale projects. Here are 14 of the best presales of 2024, according to the team at Cryptonews: See the 14 Cryptocurrencies The post Best Crypto to Buy Today March 15 – Jupiter, Conflux, Solana appeared first on Cryptonews.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Friday, March 15th, 2024 – Imagine a world where you can trade with an edge based on the hyper-visualization of a state-of-the-art virtual and augmented reality ecosystem – well that’s just a fraction of what 5thScape ($5SCAPE) is offering, and there’s much more besides.First-of-its-kind crypto-powered VR and AR project 5thScape has raised $1.15 million so far in the first stage of its presale.5thScape is pitching itself as the world’s first VR/AR mixed-reality platform to truly break boundaries through its integration of crypto tokenization to provide a superior reward experience.To lock in the lowest prices, prospective buyers will need to move quickly. The $5SCAPE token is currently priced at $0.00187 but will eventually list at a 434.76% price premium ($0.01) to this opening Stage 1 presale price. When Stage 1 finishes in two days’ time, the presale price rises by 14.97% to $0.00215 in Stage 2. Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale. The excitement around the project is shown by the size of the community on social media. 5thScape’s Discord server already has more than 5,400 members, Telegram 16,588, X/Twitter 9,569 and 1,000-plus on its YouTube channel Tokenization to play a major role in the future of VR 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Users will be able to stake $5SCAPE to earn rewards and unlock a wealth of utility-rich features. A dynamic staking pool will be in part funded by player subscriptions and participation in virtual experiences. As more players are onboarded it grows the liquidity pool of the ecosystem to provide the basis for attractive and rewarding annual percentage yield from staking activities.For gamers, $5SCAPE is the universal currency for unlocking products and services in a seamless transactional environment, such as buying and trading in-game assets and access to premium content.On the other hand, for developers $5SCAPE tokens can be earned for building games for the platform and participation in the 5thScape Developer center.The initial product offering includes an impressive array of games, from MMA Cage Contest to soccer VR sporting fun Immersive Kickoff, racing game Thrust Hunter and Archery Master, an adventure game where you follow in the footsteps of a legendary archer. Interested parties can join the waitlist for all the games today. 5thScape chooses Ethereum for its superior technology and vibrant community 5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities.This is a smart choice. Transaction costs for Layer 2 technologies that run on top of Ethereum’s blockchain are coming down following the Dencun upgrade, so ecosystems like 5thScape’s will be beneficiaries.But with VR there is much more than just gaming. Virtual reality technology provides a platform for commerce that will break down the boundaries between industries and magnify the value potential of each. From movies to education, there are revolutionary opportunities open to those companies and projects that can harness the technology in a way that makes it appealing and accessible for all.The team at 5thScape has thought through how to overcome the barriers to adoption by developing its own hardware and through the innovative use of blockchain-based software. Tokenization plus VR Ultra headset and Swiftscape VR chair set 5thScape apart To work well, virtual reality and augmented reality need great hardware too. So the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair in order to maximize comfort and ergonomics to deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls. For all the power and technological innovation (and expense) of Apple’s Vision Pro, much of that can be for naught if the experience of wearing and using the headset is so uncomfortable it limits the engagement with the device and enjoyment.The efforts of Meta in this field have certainly in many ways been pioneering – or at least the companies it has acquired have been. Meta’s family of Quest headsets has helped to create a bridgehead for VR while Apple’s mixed reality approach has literally opened the eyes of many to the possibilities, if not the wallets. VR is a chance for crypto-native agile tech companies to blossom But neither Meta nor Apple, or the other big tech companies, have shown any inclination to leverage the proven benefits of crypto as the foundation for a trustless economy that facilitates players’ value interactions. That means nimble tech-savvy crypto-first innovators like 5thScape can carve out a niche for themselves and establish a competitive advantage.The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build out the decentralized network infrastructure. 5thScape is audited by Coinsult and no major issues have been found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC’d by SolidProof; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024. Also encouraging for potential investors, a link to CEO Anoj Kumar’s LinkedIn is provided on the website, as are those of the rest of the leadership team.An active wallets widget on the homepage shows that there is purchasing activity from countries all over the world, such as Germany, Australia, the United States and Japan, to name a few. $5SPACE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB or card.

  "article_detailed_content": "March has seen several web3 initiatives to recognize and spotlight women’s achievements in celebration of Women’s History Month. This annual observance, established in 1987, emphasizes the profound contributions women have made to society. Diversity Drives Web3 Growth Monica Talán, Founder and Contributor at Spanish-language web3 platform CryptoConexión, told Cryptonews that raising awareness for women in web3 is not just about achieving gender balance. Rather, Talán believes that highlighting women in the web3 sector will expand the field’s talent pool, leading to fresh perspectives and new approaches. “This will create more equitable economic opportunities, build inclusive communities, and ensure that the future of technology reflects and serves the needs of all,” said Talán. This is critical, as 2023 data suggests that women hold about 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry. Statistics further show that only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male. According to Talán, women make up 47% of CryptoConexión’s audience. She explained that by shifting the perspective from “believing women must adapt to web3” to “understanding that web3 must evolve to embrace women” has helped with the platform’s diversity. Talán explained that CryptoConexión spotlighted 60 Latinas contributing to the web3 sector at the start of Women’s History Month this year. “This list also included newcomers,” said Talán. “This effort highlights the importance of representation, aiming to inspire more Latinas to join web3 and create a more inclusive, diverse digital future.” Sandy Carter, COO at web3 domain platform Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that women in the crypto sector have indeed innovated in unique ways. Carter shared that Unstoppable hosted a space on the X platform focused on “the power of tokenization and women” on March 8 – International Women’s Day. “We had guests like Dr Anino Emuwa, who founded 100 Women Davos, and The Africa Women CEO Network,” she said. “We also had the Director from Boss Beauties who worked on the Mattel Barbie and Boss Beauty NFT project.” Honored to be part of @UnstoppableWow3's initiative to empower women in #Web3 and #AI this International Women's Day.

Kim Currier, Head of Marketing at the Decentraland Foundation, told Cryptonews that from March 26-29, Decentraland will showcase the art of talented women during its second annual “Art Week” and “MESHfair.” “MESHfair is a unique opportunity for artists to explore their creativity in a virtual environment,” said Currier. Currier added that women artists will represent 16 of the 32 international artists selected to show new works during MESHfair. Image of MeshFAIR 2023. Source: MeshFAIR Artist and web3 producer Bay Backner founded MESHfair. Backner told Cryptonews that MESHfair acts as a way to connect artists working in the 3D file format for virtual reality (VR) with galleries and collectors. “Despite widespread interest in VR, works in this format are still underrepresented in both traditional art fairs and influential NFT collections,” said Backner. Backner added that 13.7% of living artists represented by galleries in Europe and North America are women. “Of the 100 most expensive works ever sold, none have been made by a woman,” she said. “So there is still a long way to go towards gender equality in-real life art.” Unfortunately, Backner believes that a similar gender gap is opening within the VR sector. This may be due to a lack of women-led Metaverse companies. According to McKinsey, only 10% of the virtual world or metaverse companies that gained funding during the 2017-2022 crypto boom were led by women. “So unless we work on discoverability here – sharing the work of women entrepreneurs and creatives in VR – we’ll see the same tired old narratives being repeated,” remarked Backner. With this in mind, Backner explained that MESHfair is important for discoverability. “It supports the small, but growing community of creators in immersive web3 technology. And every artist in this space right now is making history,” she said. “They’re defining a new artistic medium. It’s therefore especially important that women artists are a documented and discoverable part of this conversation.” A female artist by the name of “JaneDAO” told Cryptonews that displaying her work during MESHfair and Women’s History Month provides a platform to inspire through sharing and creating. “It’s a chance to highlight the diverse creativity and insights women bring to these fields, reinforcing that art communicates universally powerful messages,” she said. “My involvement not only showcases my contributions but also shines a light on the broader impact of women in this space, sparking important conversations about our shaping role in the future of tech and art.” Image created by JaneDAO. Source: MeshFAIR Women in Web3 Continue to be Highlighted Even as Women’s History Month comes to an end, women-focused initiatives will continue in hopes of encouraging women’s participation in web3. Talán recognizes that the blockchain sector often presents a hurdle for women. She suggests focusing on simplifying web3 concepts and platforms, thus making the sector more approachable, as a key factor in changing the current dynamic. “The technical jargon, lack of easy-to-use platforms, and fast pace can be intimidating, especially in a field historically dominated by men,” said Talán. “Despite these challenges, significant progress is being made through dedicated ongoing efforts to onboard women into web3.” For example, Talán explained that initiatives like SheFi, Unstoppable Women of web3, HER DAO, Black Women Blockchain Council, and the Association for Women in Crypto are key in demystifying the space. Each of these platforms offers continued education, resources, and community support. “In Latin America, ‘WAGMI LATAM’s’ collaboration with communities like Cripto Curiosas, WomenBiz, WEDAO LATAM, WARMI, Mujeres en Crypto and Metagals have shown us the importance of creating local and regional inclusive environments,” added Talán. Backner further noted that she will be hosting upcoming projects geared toward women this year. “My two upcoming projects are Decentraland Gaming Week (June 2024) which will support diverse creators to build interactive web3 games, and The Censored Art Show (Sept 2024) which will support digital artists impacted by censorship or shadowbanning on social media and other platforms,” she said. Backner pointed out that censorship in particular is an issue that disproportionately affects women and minority digital artists. “This is especially the case if artists use their own bodies within their works,” she said. Additionally, Carter shared that Unstoppable will continue its commitment to increasing women’s involvement in web3 and tech in general. “We plan to expand our educational initiatives, offering more workshops, courses, and mentorship programs tailored for women,” she said. “Networking events and safe spaces for discussions will continue to be a priority, ensuring women feel supported and connected.” The post Web3 Community Celebrates Women’s History Month in The Metaverse and Beyond appeared first on Cryptonews.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could breed a dangerous new category of crypto-based crime in the coming years, according to blockchain intelligence platform Chainalysis. Crypto Criminals Adopting Artificial Intelligence During a private video webinar viewed by Cryptonews on Thursday, Chainalysis Cybercrimes Research Lead Eric Jardine summarized growing and shrinking trends in illicit blockchain activity in 2023, and predicted what sorts of tactics criminals will adopt next. We’re excited to announce that our 2024 Crypto Crime Report is now available! You can download your copy here. Want a preview first? Keep reading this thread for one key takeaway from each chapter. https://t.co/t8wgHJZ8he pic.twitter.com/MhY00Hw0yM — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) February 29, 2024 The expert said internal discussions are already underway about how rising technologies could impact blockchain crime – especially large language models (LLMs). “I think that there’s ways in which they will affect different categories of crime,” said Jardine. “You could imagine an AI model that does code audits being used to improve the security of DeFi… conversely the same models could be used by illicit actors to find vulnerabilities in smart contracts.” The DeFi sector is disproportionately targeted by cryptocurrency theft, with hackers exploiting flaws in code, obtaining private keys, and using price manipulation to steal assets. Formal audits have become something of a blockchain industry standard, though their success at preventing hacks is far from foolproof. With AI, however, there’s no telling whether it will strengthen smart contacts or their attackers the most, and the balance of its benefits may oscillate over time. The absolute volume of stolen DeFi funds dropped from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, with the number of incidents also falling from 273 to 172. Using Artificial Intelligence For Romance Scams Beyond its impact on DeFi, artificial intelligence could have worrying implications for romance scams, also known as “pig butchering” scams. These scams begin with seemingly innocent contact, evolving into a fabricated relationship that the scammer then exploits for financial gain. “That is an area where a large language model that has infinite patience and is quite creative could be used to devastating effect by illicit actors,” Jardine added. Romance scammers in crypto nearly doubled their revenue last year compared to 2022, despite a decline in total scam volume from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The average size of a romance payment is $4,593, though the average victim likely paid far more since such scams often involve multiple payments. As a share of all crypto transactions, illicit activity fell to just 0.34% of blockchain activity in 2023.

  "article_detailed_content": "The Bitcoin (BTC) price saw big swings on Friday, with droves of traders on both the bullish and bearish sides getting their positions wiped out as US spot Bitcoin ETF buyers continue to battle against profit-taking sellers. BTC began Friday’s session above $71,000 before selling off sharply during Asian trading session. Having dropped to as low as $65,500 the Bitcoin price abruptly rallied back to $70,500 during US trading hours. It was last trading around $68,000, with leveraged futures positions worth $200 million having been wiped out, as per coinglass.com. This marked the most punishing day for the bulls since March 4, when long positions worth $244 million were liquidated. Since printing fresh record highs near $74,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost bullish momentum. Profit-takers appear to have taken control of the market despite still elevated demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Profits At Absurd Levels, On-Chain Analysis Reveals As per CryptoCon, a 30-day moving average of a widely followed on-chain metric called the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio is at “absurd” levels. When #Bitcoin profits get high, investors get ancy to sell. ETF inflows don't change that.

But it does suggest that investors sitting on big profits are likely getting “antsy to sell”. At current levels of around $68,000, the Bitcoin price is up over 60% year-to-date. Massive spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have been the main driver of the rally. And they have been accelerating recently. As per a JP Morgan research note, weekly inflows were the largest this week since their January launch. ❖ Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows the largest since launch: JPMorgan In a note covering cryptocurrency markets, JPMorgan said that Bitcoin ETF inflows were at their largest since the launch this week.

That’s despite the cryptocurrency hitting a new all-time before its April halving event, rather than after. For the first time in history bitcoin has hit an all time high before the halving we are seeing a demand shock from the etfs and next month we will have a supply shock pic.twitter.com/VlSiLK0LTY — Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) March 11, 2024 Where to Next for the Bitcoin Price? In past Bitcoin bull markets, the price commonly reversed around 30% lower from local highs. As recently as January, Bitcoin dipped from the at the time yearly high of around $49,000 to as low as $38,500. That suggests that Bitcoin’s latest pullback potentially has legs. A retest of $50,000 isn’t out of the question, based on historical comparisons. But ETFs may have changed the game. Major institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market for the first time, with the knowledge of its volatility but also potential upside, are likely to be less price sensitive than past cohorts of Bitcoin investors. They are also likely to have a “buy-the-dip” mentality that may help cushion BTC price declines. Any BTC price dips now may struggle to extend beyond 10-15%. That suggests $60,000 could be a near-term price floor. The Bitcoin Price could dip to the low $60,000s, but could then fly higher towards $100,000. Source: TradingView $74,000 could easily be the pre-halving high. But that could set the stage for a breakout to fresh record levels later in the year and a challenge of $100,000.

  "article_detailed_content": "Applied Digital announced on March 15 that it had concluded the sale of its 200-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility to Marathon Digital Holdings for $87.3 million. In the announcement, the Nasdaq-listed mining company mentioned that the mining plant is in Garden City, Texas. The second quarter of 2024 is the expected date of completion for the deal. Applied Digital Announces $87.3 Million Deal Some stated modifications to the acquisition agreement could see Marathon Digital Holdings pay a gross purchase price of $97.3 million. Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins stated that this acquisition would bolster and equip the company with more financial resources. He also mentioned that this transaction would strengthen the foundation for long-term expansion and operational superiority. It will ultimately help Applied Digital concentrate on constructing HPC data centers, making it a purposeful pivot. Bloomberg reported that Marathon intends to purchase more mining sites in preparation for Bitcoin’s halving event. The facility was built in 2023. Before this acquisition, Marathon served as a hosting client and had earlier used the site for a hosting agreement. Marathon will remain a hosting client at Applied Digital’s North Dakota data center even after acquiring the Texas facility. Applied Digital also reiterated its commitment to improve and grow its HPC (high-performance computing) potential. The company also announced a collaboration with Together AI earlier this week. The partnership will see Together AI use Applied Digital’s Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) for its operations. Many companies in the Bitcoin mining industry are now diversifying into the generative AI industry. Joining them is the Nasdaq-listed mining company, which is now set to also experiment with generative AI technologies. Marathon Digital’s BitCoin Mining Exploits In late February, Marathon reported a self-mining hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). With Bitcoin’s next halving scheduled for April 20, the block reward is expected to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. To strengthen its position for this, Marathon has strategically bolstered its financial resources. As of January 31, Marathon possessed over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and bitcoin combined. Financial projections indicate this will propel the company’s hash rate to a projected 50 EH/s by the end of 2025. Additionally, Marathon has made major moves to expand its mining capacity. In January, the company acquired two mining sites in Nebraska and Texas for approximately $179 million (390 MW). This latest acquisition of Applied Digital’s Texas Bitcoin mining facility further solidifies Marathon’s role as a major player in the digital asset mining industry.

This marks an early example of a mainstream musician exploring blockchain distribution. The Mac & Cheese 5 account detailed the process of this event, stating that it made the singer the first mainstream artist to inscribe a complete song onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin Ordinals and French Montana’s Inscription The account added that the musical inscription became immutable and non-custodial, making it the first of its kind. The monumental MP4 file occupied an entire block, and the saga continues with Chapter 2.

Community Anticipation and Collaborative Effort on Digital Content Ownership Prior to its release, French Montana’s use of the Bitcoin blockchain generated mixed discussions within online communities. The Mac & Cheese 5 account reported a high level of engagement, citing 50,000 comments related to the project. Commentary surrounding the release ranged from enthusiastic to critical. Some members of the music community expressed support for French Montana’s utilization of blockchain technology for distribution, highlighting its immutability and resistance to censorship. Others voiced concerns surrounding the use of the Bitcoin blockchain for purposes beyond financial transactions. The potential use of Bitcoin Ordinals within the music industry raises questions about the balance between innovation and the blockchain’s intended function. French Montana’s “Bag Curious” project could potentially encourage further exploration of decentralized technologies within the creative sectors.

  "article_detailed_content": "As reported by a JPMorgan analyst, Bitcoin has surged past gold in terms of investor portfolio allocation, taking volatility into account. Specifically, Bitcoin’s allocation is 3.7 times greater than that of gold. Additionally, they pointed out a net inflow of $9 billion into Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, which offsets outflows from Grayscale. Crypto Market Surges 40% as Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $10 Billion Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director at JPMorgan, revealed that, when adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin allocation in investor portfolios now exceeds gold by 3.7 times. ❖ Bitcoin has already surpassed gold in investor portfolio allocation: JPMorgan JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that, when adjusting for volatility, Bitcoin's allocation in investor portfolios has already outpaced that of gold. Specifically, the flagship… — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 15, 2024 The analyst highlighted the accelerated inflows of over $10 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their approval in January and claimed the potential BTC ETF market size could reach $62 billion, using gold as a benchmark. Another report from JPM Securities predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could expand to as much as $220 billion in the next two to three years, projecting a substantial impact on Bitcoin’s price due to increased capital inflows. The approval of BTC ETFs has already positively affected the crypto market. In the past month, the total market capitalization soared by nearly 40% to $2.2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers, increasing by 45% and 47% respectively. Altcoins also benefited, experiencing double-digit gains, alongside further growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable increase in net sales, reaching $6.1 billion in February compared to $1.5 billion in January. On top of this, BTC surged by 31% in a month, reaching an all-time high of over $73,800 – a rise that coincided with inflows into spot BTC ETFs. Crypto mining stocks mirrored this trend, also reaching new record highs in February. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Expected to Grow: Analyst Projections See $62 Billion Market Within 3 Years Early this month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that only 7% ($230 billion) of the $3.3 trillion global investment in gold is held in funds, with the remaining portion stored in bars and coins. Drawing a parallel with the gold market, analysts applied a volatility ratio of 3.7 to project a potential size of $62 billion for the spot BTC ETF market within the next two to three years. This figure, however, might primarily reflect a shift of existing investments from other instruments towards ETFs rather than entirely new capital entering the market. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) have already attracted $19 billion in cumulative inflows, representing nearly half of the $36 billion rotational shift anticipated by JPMorgan for the entirety of 2024. Accounting for the $10 billion outflow from GBTC, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs remain at an impressive $9 billion. Notably, net sales for spot BTC ETFs also saw a significant climb, reaching $6.1 billion in February, compared to $1.5 billion in January. The largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs hit a peak of over $1 billion on March 12, with analysts speculating that this figure could rise further once outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF cease. Bears can't win this game until spot #Bitcoin ETF inflow stops. Last week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC. Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by US entities. At this rate, we'll see a sell-side liquidity crisis within 6 months. pic.twitter.com/qwAbZJwSOl — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) March 12, 2024 With the Bitcoin halving just over a month away, predictions abound regarding the potential for heightened demand and a supply crisis within the next six months. Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto-analytic firm CryptoQuant, foresees this development as fuel for increased demand. After a prolonged crypto winter lasting nearly three years, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has acted as a catalyst for BTC’s renewed positive price action, propelling it beyond the all-time high of the last bull cycle, exceeding $69,000. This has also opened the doors to institutional adoption, led by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock.

  "article_detailed_content": "The European Commission formally enquired into strategies adopted by big tech companies on March 14 to mitigate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) risks capable of misleading election voters. The commission has given big tech an April 3 deadline to provide documents and information to its requests. The European Commission issued the official request to big technological companies including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Google Search, Bing, Snapchat, and YouTube. European Commission Questions Big Techs over Generative AI’s Hazards According to Bloomberg, this was conveyed in a formal request for information (RFI). The commission asked the companies to provide further information about hazards posed by generative AI. This is because the big tech companies allow users to create and spread content using the technology. The EU is most concerned about the precautions to mitigate the risks of generative AI to election voters, believing that the spread of viral deepfakes and automated service manipulation can impact voters’ perceptions. There is now proposed legislation requiring gen AI companies to share details of their training data in the US, the EU and the UK. It’s not perfect, but it’s a strong move in the right direction. US: https://t.co/uBirDixCZi EU: https://t.co/o0DZ9mxCYY UK:… — Ed Newton-Rex (@ednewtonrex) March 12, 2024 Following the information requests, the European Commission has the authority to impose penalties for errors, inconsistencies, or misrepresentation. This decision follows the EU’s recent e-commerce and online governance regulations — the Digital Services Act (DSA). This act classified eight platforms as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). In this light, it has mandated VLOPs to assess and manage systemic risks in addition to following other outlined guidelines. Meanwhile, election security is another area of concern that the commission is looking into as it seeks answers to the impact of generative AI on election processes. Other concerns include gender-based violence, distribution of illicit content, defense of fundamental rights, minors, as well as mental health. EU Moves Towards Election Security Rules The European Commission has been actively looking into the impact of AI on voters, even as the use of AI increases across all fields. A recent study showed the capacity of AI to spread misinformation among voters, for example. The EU is already counting down to March 27 to finalize election security regulations. The European body has been requesting feedback on election security statutes including by public consultations. This recent RFI to the big tech companies is considered a crucial request that will aid the creation of the EU’s election security policy. Once created, the policy will help combat lingering election security challenges – including misinformation among voters.

  "article_detailed_content": "Democratic Senators Laphonza Butler (D-CA) and Jack Reed (D-RI) are pushing United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler to “strictly limit” the approval of crypto-based ETFs, in a March 11 letter addressed to Gensler. Crypto ETFs Pose Risk To American People In the letter, Butler and Reed claim cryptocurrencies pose “significant and unique risks” to the American people. “The SEC’s approvals have provided a green light for Wall Street to sell volatile cryptocurrency investments to ordinary Americans through their brokerage and retirement accounts,” the letter read. The democratic senators also cited the January 2024 report from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) showing that an estimated 70% of brokers’ communications to retail investors regarding cryptocurrencies violated fair disclosure rules. “These alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete or deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors,” Reed and Butler stated. How Likely Is A Spot Ethereum ETF? Reed and Butler’s letter follows the SEC’s January approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs, causing bitcoin’s price to surge. Earlier this week, the token’s price soared over $73,000 to mark an all-time high during its latest rally. The cryptocurrency’s rally coincides with rising discussions regarding the potential SEC approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, with experts plummeting the estimated chances of approval in May to just 35%. The blockbuster success of the Bitcoin ETF is upsetting to high ranking Dems. Buyer’s remorse. This is part of why we are pessimistic re spot Eth etf approval chances. https://t.co/SGEAkGQGyD — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 14, 2024 “The blockbuster success of the Bitcoin ETF is upsetting to high-ranking Dems,” wrote Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas. “Buyer’s remorse. This is part of why we are pessimistic re spot Eth etf approval chances.” SEC To Monitor Brokers’ Communications About ETFs? Meanwhile, the senators alleged that Bitcoin ETFs should be referred to as exchange-traded products (ETPs) due to the lack of “restrictions on harmful practices that apply to most investment funds marketed to retail investors,” including limits on leverage, custody requirements, and examination by the SEC. “Although it may seem like a small distinction, this purposeful confusion of terminology is troubling because bitcoin ETPs are different in critical ways from mutual funds and ETFs,” the senators stated. The letter then requested Gensler to closely monitor communications from brokers and advisors regarding ETFs as well as to ensure Bitcoin ETFs “do not use inappropriate and confusing naming conventions” in official filings. “These steps would help protect investors from fraud and abuse, which may be enabled by the current light-touch regulatory regime applicable to Bitcoin ETPs,” the letter concluded. As of time of publication, Gensler has yet to publicly reply to the letter.

  "article_detailed_content": "Earlier this year, Binance quietly split from its venture capital division, Binance Labs, and established as an independent entity now valued at $10 billion. This change in operation became effective on March 15 under Binance’s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, who assumed the role four months ago. Binance Labs Severs Ties, Maintains Branding A disclaimer announcing the split was published on the website saying, “Binance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).” Following the effect of this change in operation, personnel at Binance Labs now operate under separate employment agreements from Binance exchange staff. This is in line with the arrangements that are effective at the Binance-backed blockchain network, BNB Chain. In an unexpected move, #Binance has spun off its venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity valued at $10 billion. This strategic decision aims to enhance operational efficiency and growth under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng. Despite the separation,… — Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) March 15, 2024 Investment Director at Binance Labs, Alex Odagiu noted that they are no longer affiliated with the Binance group as well. He said this while clarifying that the venture capital entity would continue to use the Binance brand under a licensing agreement. Binance Labs has invested in over 250 projects since it launched. There are many companies in its portfolio that have been impacted by this transition into an independent firm. Some are industry giants like PancakeSwap, Polygon, Sky Mavis, and Curve DAO. Aptos Labs, LayerZero, and The Sandbox are some of the other companies involved. In February, Binance Labs invested in Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol that introduced the concept of native Bitcoin staking. The investment enables users to stake their Bitcoins on Proof-of-Stake blockchains and earn yields without relying on third-party custody. This bridges services, or token wrapping mechanisms. The unfolding events at Binance have been on the crypto community’s radar since a November settlement with US authorities. The authorities charged Binance $4.3 billion and demanded that founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao step down. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs’ core operations are expected to stay unaffected, with an emphasis on finding and investing in promising crypto projects. Venture Capital Trend Among Crypto Exchanges In 2018, Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and co-founded Binance alongside Zhao launched the venture capital division. As a venture capital and incubator, Binance Labs uses funds from the exchange’s profits to back early-stage crypto projects. The splitting of these two entities does not appear to be a cause for major concern within the Binance ecosystem. Binance still holds the largest market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs), accounting for about 50% of global trading volume. The Binance native token, BNB, has experienced a slight decline since the news broke, however. At the time of reporting, BNB was trading at $584.31, representing a decrease of 2.81%. Aside from Binance, popular exchanges in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken have also established venture capital businesses. Coinbase Ventures was the second-most active investor in the crypto sector in 2023, according to data from PitchBook. Odagiu admitted that in Binance Lab’s case, the transition will not have much impact on the company. The post Crypto Investor Binance Splits from Venture Capital Arm appeared first on Cryptonews.",

GM #SPONGERS! Did someone say moon? Trade $SPONGE on @dexscreener https://t.co/mRRzvNqdpm#MemeCoin #Crypto #Altcoins #Bullish #100x pic.twitter.com/iVOCDTYMVz — $SPONGE (@spongeoneth) March 8, 2024 What Is SPONGEV2 and How Could It Repeat The Success of SPONGE V1? Sponge V1 made its debut during the bear market of May 2023, a fair launch token that instantly captivated meme coin virality due to its nostalgic and catchy namesake. In a dramatic climb, the first SPONGE token exploded to become on of the biggest meme coin launches of the year – hitting an all-time high market cap of over $100M and generating a community of more than 13,000 holders (and an additional 30,000 followers on social media). Much of these major price gains were fuelled by listings on more than 10 centralized exchanges, including LBank, Toobit, CoinW, BTCEX, Poloniex, MEXC, Gate.io, Bitget, BitKan, and BitMart. And this is why crypto whales are now betting big on SPONGE V2. Sponge V2 was not a traditional launch, to acquire this new token – early holders had two options – either buying SPONGE V1 and then staking it through the Sponge website, or, staking already held SPONGE V1. The SPONGE V2 airdrop saw tokens distributed based upon the quantity and length of time V1 tokens were staked. But the hype behind SPONGE V2 doesn’t stop at the network migration it also seeks to deliver Play-to-Earn (P2E) utility to the Sponge ecosystem. SPONGE V2 Play-2-Earn Promise Could Supercharge Ecosystem The Sponge V2 team is developing a bespoke Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, bringing an exciting new utility to the token. Users will have the opportunity to earn $SPONGEV2 tokens by playing the game and ranking on the leaderboard. The game will feature both free and paid versions, allowing users to play for fun or use $SPONGEV2 tokens to purchase game credits for additional in-game earnings. SPONGE V2 Price Analysis: As SPONGE V2 Climbs To $1M Market Cap – Could It Repeat 100X? At the time of writing, SPONGE V2 is currently trading at a market price of $0.003087 (representing a 24-hour change of -7.14%). This comes as price continues to wrestle with a minor -26% localized retracement move after rising to establish a new early-stage all-time high at $0.004240 on March 9. Now in consolidation, SPONGE V2 has established a well-defended lower support zone between $0.0027 and $0.0031 over the past week – priming price action for its next leg-up. Upside movements are now targeting a pushback above higher supper at $0.00365 as buy-pressure remains dominant over the past 24-hours representing 59% of transactions. Overall, price analysis leaves SPONGE V2 in a bullish ascendant trading channel in the weekend, with price primed for a bounce ahead of major exchange listings following a successful consolidation. Still representing a fantastic entry at $1.1m – if crypto whales are right – this project could undertake as much as a 100x return from current levels (based on historical market caps). The Bottom Line As Sponge V2 heads towards major exchange listings, crypto whales are rushing to accumulate in anticipation of major gains, bringing a new chapter to the already remarkable history of SPONGE token. The team’s commitment to utility, staking, and a P2E game makes Sponge V2 a project to watch closely. Stay tuned for updates on social channels and witness the evolution of Sponge in the crypto seas.

You can call it our first #Bitcoin piggy bank It's not much, but it's honest work pic.twitter.com/dqzedykxT1 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) March 14, 2024 “You can call it our first Bitcoin piggy bank,” Bukele wrote. “It’s not much, but it’s honest work.” El Salvador’s Historic Bitcoin Adoption: Future of Nation-Building Redefined El Salvador became the first nation to use bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021 when bitcoin was trading around $51,000. News of the country’s latest Bitcoin strategy comes as the token reached an all-time high of over $73,000 earlier this week. Its price has been rallying in recent months following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The rally is expected to intensify as anticipation builds for the token’s quadrennial halving event, scheduled to occur next month. As of March 15, Bukele’s announcement received over 2,000 replies on X, most of which are seemingly positive. “El Salvador is a case study on how to positively transform a country,” one X user wrote. This type of move makes other countries look incompetent and behind. You are leading the way! It would be great to interview you @nayibbukele, talking about how you’re setting up the next generation for success in El Salvador Check out my highlights & https://t.co/OeZuKIHIFQ — Randi Hipper (@missteencrypto) March 15, 2024 “This type of move makes other countries look incompetent and behind,” another said. “You are leading the way!” El Salvador On Track To Become One Of The Richest Countries In The World? Meanwhile, a number of U.S. officials have lambasted the country’s crypto-forward policy, with U.S. senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) originally introducing “Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act” in 2022, citing U.S. security and trade concerns. “Using cryptocurrency as legal tender could weaken economic and financial stability and empower malign actors,” said Risch. “Given U.S. interest on prosperity and transparency in Central America, we must seek greater clarity on how the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender may impact El Salvador’s financial and economic stability, as well as El Salvador’s capacity to effectively combat money laundering and illicit finances.” However, based on the country’s current bitcoin holdings, U.S. lawmakers may have nothing to worry about. “Within maybe 30 or 40 years, El Salvador will have gone from the poorest, most crime ridden country, to maybe one of the richest, most innovative countries in the world, just in that period of time,” venture capitalist Tim Draper said on Rachel Wolfson’s Web3 Deep Dive podcast. “And this is just because they embraced Bitcoin.” The post El Salvador Transfers 5,000 Bitcoins to Cold Wallet, Surpassing Bitcoin Holdings Estimates appeared first on Cryptonews.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Rumors are spreading like wildfire across the crypto grapevine that the state of Qatar could be making a huge, possibly multibillion-dollar huge, Bitcoin (BTC) bet soon. At least one article claims the Middle Eastern nation may have already made the leap and purchased 50,000 BTC in a series of daily installments of 100 BTC each. As yet, there is no substantial evidence tying the Emir of Qatar or the state’s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), to a giant Bitcoin investment, although rumors have tended that way since December. Still, there are only a few explanations for the mysterious case of the “Mr 100,” and in any case, one thing is clear: there is some hefty whale movement around Bitcoin between the successful launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January and the upcoming halving on April 19, a quadrennial event that halves miners’ Bitcoin revenue and thereby the new supply. Let’s get into why some people think Qatar’s Sovereign Wealth Fund is diversifying with Bitcoin. Qatar’s Emir Warms To Bitcoin The rumor mill began churning back in December last year when Bitcoin maxi influencer Max Keiser tweeted, “the rumors are getting very loud on this” while suggesting the QIA was possibly looking to buy half a trillion in Bitcoin.

Their SWF rumored to looking to buy 1/2 trillion #BTC pic.twitter.com/hm86KwtAj7 — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) December 4, 2023 A series of reports add weight to Kaiser’s claim that Qatar is becoming Bitcoin curious. Firstly, people noted the warming relations between Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and El Salvador President and notorious Bitcoin bull Nayib Bukele. Bukele made Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador back in 2021 and the country is speculated to have 5,689.68 BTC. A picture also made the rounds on social media of Qatar’s Executive Gulfstream G650ER jet at an airport in Madeira, Portugal, a day after MicroStrategy executive chairman, co-founder and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor’s talk at Bitcoin Atlantis.

  "article_detailed_content": "Popular meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) plummeted 12% in the space of 24 hours to trade at $2.85 at the time of writing. Broadly speaking, all leading meme coins share the same fate today, with market leaders Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE posting similar losses. Crypto’s novelty coin sector is bearing the brunt of a broader market downturn that has today shaved 6% from market leader Bitcoin (BTC) which was trading at all-time highs earlier yesterday, but now sells at $68,118. Nearest contender Ethereum (ETH) also shed 5% overnight and changes hands at $3,711.54. Crypto has been doing well for most of the year-to-date off the back of hype around 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved for trading on January 10. The ETFs have been very successful. So far they have collectively netted $12 billion, helping Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $73,737.94 yesterday. On Tuesday, the ETFs took in $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock’s accounting for the $848 million bulk of it. However the release that day of last month’s hot US inflation readings appear to have dampened enthusiasm for riskier assets this weekend. Over on WIF’s trading chart we can see a gradual rally from the end of February that starts to get volatile around a week into March. The sudden upward momentum on Tuesday March 12 was very bullish but it fizzled out by Thursday. Given WIF’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of about 50, it’s not likely to decline unless Bitcoin does. In any case, WIF will find strong support at $2. Source: TradingView WIF Memes Offer Less Utility Than VR Gaming Tokens WIF is pure meme stock, which makes it a volatile allocation for any portfolio. Meme coins are highly whimsical in nature and their pricing often exaggerates market trends. For instance, when Bitcoin was rallying last week, meme coins were rallying even harder. Today, when Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting losses, leading meme coins are posting heavier ones. Investors who want to support the altcoin sector should really limit their exposure to altcoins. Since their value is dictated by their viral appeal and trendiness rather than their underlying protocol, a sudden loss of interest could be disastrous for holders. Blockchain proponents believe that the future of gaming will incorporate blockchain tech to handle and record payments. Not only will blockchain be more integrated in gaming, it will also be more present in the wider web. Advocates of the idea refer to this iteration of the internet as Web 3. Another technology that will drive future innovations in gaming and the web is virtual reality (VR). With that in mind, it would seem that the crypto projects that are most ahead of the curve are VR gaming projects like 5th Scape ($5SCAPE).

  "article_detailed_content": "NFPrompt, a content generation platform incubated by Binance Labs, disclosed a crypto security breach resulting in the loss of user and platform funds. The hackers reportedly gained unauthorized access to several wallets, including those belonging to NFP’s administrators, and stole funds. NFPrompt Hit by Crypto Security Breach: Platform Takes Action to Secure User Assets NFPrompt acknowledged a “critical security incident” on March 15 that allowed hackers to compromise several wallets and steal funds. This included unauthorized access to a portion of the platform’s treasury and ecosystem fund, along with the wallets of NFP’s contract administrators. ATTENTION $NFP Holders: We are writing to inform you of a critical security incident involving NFPrompt. It was discovered that a group of hackers compromised some wallets, including those of NFP’s contract administrators. They illegally gained control of victims' funds,… pic.twitter.com/ZeQXLruvTW — NFP (@nfprompt) March 15, 2024 According to the platform’s official statement, hackers managed to compromise several wallets, including those belonging to NFP’s contract administrators, gaining unauthorized access to users’ funds, including a portion of NFP’s treasury and ecosystem fund. In response to the attack, NFPrompt took swift action to mitigate further losses. They swiftly transferred ownership of its smart contracts to new addresses, effectively isolating the hackers. While the platform assures that NFP tokens and other assets remain secure, the token’s price has drastically dropped by over 15% within the last 24 hours. NFPrompt urges users to exercise caution and refrain from accepting NFPs from unreliable sources. Additionally, they advise solely trading the token on established centralized exchanges (CEXs) until further updates regarding the incident. Collaborative efforts are underway with partner CEXs to suspend NFP deposits while investigations proceed. NFPrompt has also requested that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) temporarily halt NFP liquidity pool activities. Specific CEXs have been notified to freeze transactions potentially linked to the hackers. According to its recent statement, NFPrompt has partnered with leading Web3 security firms SlowMist and Chainalysis. Notably, the platforms seek to monitor the hackers’ on-chain activities and trace token swaps to reveal their identities and affiliates. NFPrompt Vows to Recover Stolen Funds, Works with FBI in Ongoing Investigation NFPrompt expressed its commitment to safeguarding user interests and stated that “NFP tokens associated with the attackers will be identified and rendered unusable.” The announcement further mentioned the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in assisting with apprehending the culprits. The NFPrompt team said that the FBI tracked down the hackers, and major CEXs were informed to freeze the funds related to the hackers. As of now, the exact amount of losses incurred by NFPrompt remains unclear. Launched in 2023, NFPrompt allows users to leverage AI tools to create unique artworks and claim ownership of their creations on the blockchain through NFTs. This one-of-a-kind approach attracted the attention of Binance Labs which selected NFPrompt along with 12 other projects in the sixth cohort of its incubation program in September 2023. NFPrompt, the first Web3 prompt artist platform, has received institutional seed investments at a $60 million valuation to push its mission of building the bridge between AI art and NFTs. By introducing a token that ties up the community, NFTs, and the value of masterfully imagined AI art, the NFP aligns all important metrics to build a widely adopted Web3 protocol for contemporary art and decentralized internet culture. The NFP token price has taken a hit following the security breach. According to CoinGecko data, the token has declined by 15.2% in the last 24 hours. NFP reached a high of $0.96 on March 14 before plummeting to an intraday low of $0.76 earlier today. While the current price stands at around $0.79, it remains 22% higher compared to the previous 30-day period.

  "article_detailed_content": "The PEPE price has dropped by as much as 17% overnight, with its fall to $0.000008854 coming as the market as a whole takes a big hit. Despite this correction, PEPE remains up by 6% in a week and by 690% in the last 30 days, with the coin only 16% down from its all-time high of $0.00001064, which it set yesterday. Given that today’s loss is largely the result of profit-taking from traders, PEPE has every chance of rebounding again soon enough. And as the market continues to gain in bullishness, the meme token could even break its new ATH in the next few weeks. Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Drops 17% Overnight – What’s Going On? PEPE may have dived badly overnight, but its chart and indicators suggest that now may be a great time to buy. Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has resumed rising again after almost hitting rock bottom (30) in the early hours of this morning. Source: TradingView In other words, it looks like it’s on the way back up, even if its 30-day average (yellow) is still falling. Yet the average is arguably cancelled out by PEPE’s support level (green), which is still rising and which prevented the coin from falling too far last night. At the same time, PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume remains close to $2.5 billion, indicating substantial interest in the token. This guy spent only $3,000 to buy 4.9T $PEPE($35.5M currently) in the early time! He sold 760B $PEPE($2M) and currently holds 4.15T $PEPE($30.8M), and is the 13th holder of $PEPE! His total profit on $PEPE is ~$32.8M, a gain of 11,077x!https://t.co/QTL7oxruTk pic.twitter.com/sw2FcPfgdd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 4, 2024 It’s likely that whales who had previously bought the coin have taken some profits in the past day or so, yet PEPE hasn’t fallen any harder than many other alts and meme coins. As such, it’s likely to rebound soon enough, with the market remaining positive overall. This is largely because of rising Bitcoin ETF volumes, with the possibility of Ethereum ETFs – and the approaching Bitcoin halving – also improving the wider picture. The PEPE price could easily set a new ATH in the next few weeks, while potentially reaching $0.000020 by the second half of the year. 24 hour market update – $PEPE TL;DR – $BTC weakness has caused an asset class wide dip. $PEPE made a new ATH with record high funding rates which have now re-set to a level which is low in the context of its pump (bullish). Points to be aware of; – $PEPE price has been leading… pic.twitter.com/dFFhYx5mmg — Exponential Research (@ExpoResearch) March 15, 2024 As a meme token with weak fundamentals it will always have the tendency to drop suddenly, but the medium- and long-term trajectory of the market should help push it up as a whole. New Meme Tokens Bring Greater Potential Given that PEPE is now a well-established coin, some traders may prefer to diversify into newer, smaller cap meme tokens, especially those on course to rally big as they list on new exchanges. This includes coins that have recently launched their own presales, with one of the most interesting in this category being new Ethereum-based meme token Dogecoin20 (DOGE20). It launched its presale only yesterday, yet it has already raised over $280,000, as it wins over more investors. #Dogecoin is a beloved token but has been limited in its potential future worth because it has an infinite supply that will always emit more #Tokens into the market. #DOGE20 fixes this with a fixed supply, allowing for unhindered upwards pressure on the token price. pic.twitter.com/MvnjTeVdhp — Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) March 15, 2024 The reason why Dogecoin20 is so exciting is that it takes the basic appeal of meme coins such as DOGE and combines it with a bullish staking system, a hard-capped supply, and a commitment to supporting more venerable causes. As an Ethereum-based coin, it will enable staking, with its protocol providing greater rewards to holders who stake early and for longer periods. Another interesting facet is that it will regularly distribute a portion of its supply to charitable causes, as well as to projects based within its own community. The aim of this is to encourage greater engagement and commitment to its development, which in the long run can only help it grow. It’s also worth pointing out that, unlike the infinitely inflationary Dogecoin, DOGE20 has limited itself to a max supply of 140 billion tokens. How is #Dogecoin20 different from #Dogecoin? $DOGE20 is part of the #DOGE family of #Memecoins but it adds more utility and value for holders by introducing staking on #Ethereum for passive rewards. The '20' in Dogecoin20 stands for 'ERC-20'. pic.twitter.com/UV6WOXXTj3 — Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) March 15, 2024 25% of this supply is going to its presale, with the rest going to a mix of marketing, treasury (for development and community/charity purposes), staking and liquidity. In combination, these features promise to give DOGE20 plenty of appeal, helping to push its price up over time. Investors can join its presale now by going to its official website, where they can buy 1 DOGE20 coin for $0.00014, using either ETH, USDT or fiat currency.

  "article_detailed_content": "In a testament to the resilience of investor sentiment, a stock market rally surged forward, brushing aside concerns over inflationary pressures. This bullish momentum was underpinned by a significant development in the form of an upgraded forecast for Wall Street earnings. As Bank of America revised its outlook on the US economy, highlighting the transformative impact of AI investments, the market witnessed a renewed wave of optimism, propelling stocks higher despite a backdrop of economic uncertainties. Stock market rally – Optimistic projections from Bank of America Bank of America’s bullish stance on Wall Street earnings reverberated through the market, with the institution now forecasting S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) of $250 for the year 2024, marking a notable uptick from its previous estimate of $235. This upward revision, amounting to a 12% year-on-year increase, underscored the bank’s confidence in the resilience and growth potential of the US economy. Notably, this upward trajectory in earnings forecasts coincided with the S&P 500 index’s resurgence towards record levels, further fueling investor optimism. The rationale behind Bank of America’s upgraded projections stemmed from a multifaceted analysis of economic dynamics. With the bank revising its annual GDP forecast for the year upwards to 2.7%, a marked improvement from earlier estimates, the stage was set for a robust earnings outlook. This upward revision in economic activity translated into a five-percentage-point enhancement in earnings growth, laying the groundwork for sustained market expansion. Also, the bank’s forward-looking approach extended to 2025, with earnings forecasts pegged at $275, signaling a long-term bullish sentiment.

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Haseeb Shaheen"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "In a g study conducted by Austin Adams, a researcher at Uniswap Labs, it has been revealed that conducting swaps and managing liquidity provisions on layer-2 networks is considerably more cost-effective than on Ethereum’s mainnet. This discovery sheds light on the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), where layer-2 solutions are emerging as a pivotal force in enhancing efficiency and reducing transaction costs for users. Superior liquidity and cost savings on layer-2s The research paper presents compelling evidence that layer-2 networks, such as Arbitrum, have significantly outperformed Ethereum in terms of liquidity positions, creating over three times more liquidity positions in the past year. This surge in liquidity is a testament to the growing preference among DeFi participants for layer-2 solutions, driven by their lower gas costs and higher liquidity concentration. A remarkable insight from the research reveals that an overwhelming 97.5% of traders, especially those engaging in transactions below $125,000, witnessed more favorable results on layer-2 platforms than on Ethereum’s mainnet. This finding emphasizes the substantial advantages that layer-2 solutions offer to individual traders. These benefits primarily include lower transaction costs and improved liquidity, making layer-2 networks an attractive option for retail swappers. The trend underscores the importance of layer-2 solutions in enhancing the trading experience for those operating on a smaller scale. The Impact of shorter block times as compared to Ethereum Mainnet Another advantage of layer-2 networks over Ethereum mainnet highlighted in the research is their shorter block times. For instance, while Ethereum’s average block time stands at approximately 12 seconds, Arbitrum boasts an average block time of just 0.26 seconds. This reduction in block time minimizes the window for price fluctuations, thereby decreasing the profitability of arbitrage attempts. This scenario is beneficial for liquidity providers on layer-2 networks, who, according to the paper, earn 20% more from arbitrage compared to their counterparts on the mainnet. Despite the evident benefits, the paper does not shy away from discussing the challenges associated with layer-2 networks. One of the primary concerns is the presence of centralized sequencers in many rollups, which poses a risk of transaction reordering for maximizing miner extractable value (MEV) profits. Additionally, the lack of decentralized fraud proofs in optimistic rollups and the issue of liquidity fragmentation across over 40 layer-2 ecosystems are highlighted as areas needing improvement. To address these challenges, developers of layer-2 networks are actively working on solutions. For example, Optimism has introduced a permissionless fault-proof system, and initiatives like Espresso are exploring diversified sequencer networks for rollups. These developments are crucial steps toward mitigating the drawbacks of layer-2 networks and enhancing their reliability and decentralization. Conclusion The findings from Uniswap Labs’ research illuminate the path forward for decentralized markets, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in trading costs and user experience. Layer-2 networks, despite their current limitations, offer a myriad of benefits that can significantly enhance the trading experience for users. As these networks evolve and address their challenges, they are poised to play a central role in the future of DeFi, making decentralized markets more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for a broader audience.",

Binance, a titan in the cryptocurrency market with a daily trading volume of $40.7 billion and a global user base of over 177 million, plays a pivotal role in shaping the digital currency landscape. Its collaboration with the National Police Agency of Taiwan stands as a testament to its significant influence, enhancing anti-fraud measures and showcasing a mutual dedication to maintaining ethical standards and regulatory compliance across different regions. This partnership not only underscores Binance’s commitment to security and ethical practices but also highlights its active role in collaborating with law enforcement to protect the integrity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By working closely with the National Police Agency of Taiwan, Binance is setting a high standard for corporate responsibility and regulatory adherence in the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Enhancing anti-fraud measures through collaboration The Ministry of the Interior highlighted the establishment of an investment and order review mechanism in partnership with 9 Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) operators. This initiative, integrated with the anti-fraud hotline system of the Police Department, has streamlined the investigation process for cases involving virtual asset fraud, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement efforts. Taiwan’s approach to regulating the virtual asset space currently emphasizes the promotion of self-discipline among businesses and compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. However, with the evolving landscape of digital finance, the government anticipates introducing additional regulatory measures in the second half of the year to further safeguard the interests of investors and the integrity of the financial system. Binance’s proactive engagement with Taiwanese authorities sets a commendable standard for other exchanges worldwide. By actively supporting law enforcement efforts and demonstrating a firm commitment to regulatory compliance, Binance is not only contributing to the security of Taiwan’s financial ecosystem but also reinforcing its position as a leader in the global fight against cybercrime and financial fraud. Conclusion As the digital asset industry continues to grow, the partnership between Binance and Taiwanese law enforcement serves as a model for how exchanges and regulators can work together to protect consumers and combat illicit activities. Binance’s ongoing support for Taiwan’s efforts in crime prevention and its broader commitment to global security initiatives underscore the critical role of collaboration in ensuring the safety and stability of the virtual asset market.",

  "article_detailed_content": "The Pentagon has announced a significant change in its Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO). Craig Martell, who has led the department since its early days in 2022, is stepping down. Radha Plumb, known for her impactful roles at tech giants like Google and Facebook, will take his place. Radha Plumb brings a wealth of experience from the tech industry, with a strong background in trust, safety, and policy. Her transition to the role of Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer on April 8 starts a new chapter for the Pentagon’s AI initiatives. The Defense Department has high expectations for Plumb, anticipating her technical knowledge and strategic thinking will push the CDAO’s innovative projects to new heights. Achievements and future directions Under Craig Martell’s leadership, the CDAO has laid a strong foundation for AI and digital transformation within the Department of Defense (DOD). The formation of the CDAO itself was a strategic move, merging four key organizations to streamline data and AI operations. These efforts have aimed to enhance decision-making from the Pentagon’s boardrooms to the battlefield. The Pentagon initiatives Martell’s tenure saw the launch of five strategic initiatives focused on AI integration in fiscal year 2023. These included improving data quality and introducing better metrics for business performance. One of the standout achievements was the initiation of the Digital On-Demand service. This program partnered with MIT Horizon online platform to offer the DOD’s military and civilian personnel access to cutting-edge learning resources on AI, 5G, and big data analytics. In conclusion, Radha Plumb is at the helm to accelerate the DOD’s digital and AI capabilities. The transition reflects the Pentagon’s ongoing commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies to maintain its global defense leadership.",

Click here to download a PDF of this article. Ordinals have been a polarizing phenomenon for most every subcommunity in Bitcoin — except for miners. The meteoric rise of the new Bitcoin-native NFT standard dominated discourse for months as Ordinals flooded blockspace and buoyed transaction fees to multiyear highs. According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum. Well, miners don’t give a shit if they’re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced — or at the least, are ambivalent about — Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs — roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example — can earn $80 per day). Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin’s fourth block subsidy halving. Click the image above to subscribe! I’m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don’t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they’re important in the context of Bitcoin’s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they’re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics — and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway? In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard. An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain’s immutability. Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions. This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it’s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit’s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn’t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared. So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum’s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin’s OP_CODE function, where each “token” is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token’s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series’ max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series. These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit’s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don’t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of — if not the entire — appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards — maybe there’s a rare card in this next one! And while there isn’t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there’s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don’t know. Perhaps it’s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever. Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don’t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think. Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. Per data from independent analyst Data Always’ Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it’s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions — that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled “Bitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem”. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee “overpayment” from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block’s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that “voluntary overpayment” was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints. This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin’s mempool became backlogged in April and May — the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far — a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges. Blessing and a Curse Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They’re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don’t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it’s not my place to police someone else’s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That’s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don’t want you to make. This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Inscription Issue”.

  "article_detailed_content": "The Michael Saylor-led software company MicroStrategy has upsized its planned convertible senior notes offering from $500 million to $525 million. The company intends to use the proceeds to acquire more Bitcoin, as per their recent press release, following a strategy it has pursued since 2020. MicroStrategy announced it had priced the 0.875% convertible senior notes due 2031 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will be sold at 100% of the principal amount with an annual interest rate of 0.875%, payable semiannually. After March 2028, the company can redeem the notes in cash at 100% of the principal plus accrued interest if certain conditions are met. Holders can require MicroStrategy to repurchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus interest on September 15, 2028, or upon certain events constituting a fundamental change. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both at the company's discretion. MicroStrategy estimates the net proceeds of the offering will be approximately $515 million after fees and expenses. Led by founder and CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been aggressive in its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company now holds more than 200,000 bitcoins worth over $13 billion at press time. Saylor has said he aims to position MicroStrategy as the world's first \"Bitcoin development company,\" though details on the proposal have been scant. In the past, MicroStrategy has released alpha applications, such as a tool for allowing businesses to reward employees using Bitcoin lightning payments. As a publicly traded company using its balance sheet to acquire bitcoin at scale, MicroStrategy's plans illustrate growing corporate interest in Bitcoin as an emerging asset class and treasury asset, one that can hedge against debasement and inflation.",

Granted that faith cannot be proved, what harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false? If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.” - Blaise Pascal Blaise Pascal only lived to age 39 but became world-famous for many contributions in the fields of mathematics, physics, and theology. The above quote encapsulates Pascal’s wager—a philosophical argument for the Christian belief in the existence of God. The argument's conclusion states that a rational person should live as though God exists. Even if the probability is low, the reward is worth the risk. Pascal’s wager as a justification for bitcoin? Yes, I’m aware of the fallacies: false dichotomy, appeal to emotion, begging the question, etc. That is not the point. The point is that binary outcomes instigate extreme results, and the game theory of money suggests that it’s a winner-take-all game. The Pascalian investor: A rational approach to bitcoin Humanity’s adoption of “the best money over time” mimics a series of binary outcomes—A/B tests. Throughout history, inferior forms of money have faded as better alternatives emerged (see India’s failed transition to a gold standard). And if bitcoin is trying to be the premier money of the future, it will either succeed or it won’t. “If you ain’t first, you’re last.” -Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights, on which monies succeed over time. So, we can look at bitcoin success similarly to Pascal’s wager—let’s call it Satoshi’s wager. The translated points would go something like this: If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀 If you own bitcoin and it fails, you’ve lost that value. 😢 If you don’t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 If you don’t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡 If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we’re discussing here is asymmetric upside - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement. Salt, gasoline, and insurance “Don’t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.” A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan. Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside gives it “insurance-like” qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. Let’s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she’s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn’t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. Now, let’s salt her portfolio with bitcoin. 99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin. With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she’ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she’s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and “bitcoin insurance” made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. (When protecting against the existing system, it’s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it’s essential to keep your bitcoin in cold storage and hold your keys. Otherwise, it’s someone else’s insurance.) When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a… A construction joke: There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! Yeah. That’s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you’ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a “speculative insurance” use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. I’ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance) Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net) Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings) Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling) Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality) Making a quick buck (short-term trading) Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation) Locking away wealth that can’t be confiscated (wealth preservation) As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status) Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose) Keep this in mind when taking other people’s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. Wrapping Up A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. But, given today’s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin’s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I’d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. “We must learn our limits.

  "article_type": "article",

  "article_detailed_content": "Eleven approved Bitcoin ETFs have painted the pioneering cryptocurrency with a fresh coat of legitimacy. By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted. With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to “tulip mania”, “rat poison”, or “index of money laundering”. Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021. With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin’s price volatility. Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin’s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can’t be tampered with. For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin’s perception of value. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset’s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs’ passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle. Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient cloud security to instill investor confidence. In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC). Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via James Seyffart This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching 90% in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price. Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC’s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period. To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via Eric Balchunas This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin’s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns. During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Morning Star report. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over ~900 BTC mined per day. Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price. The Mechanism of Stabilization With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - 4th Bitcoin halving. Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That’s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, CoinShares’ report showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion. At $1.4 billion, Bitcoin represents 96% of total flows in the US. Image credit: CoinShares In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund. Given its “conservative” moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds. Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin’s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k. Bitcoin’s current market cap is within $0.85 - $0.9 billion range. Image credit: Blockware Solutions Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from FalconX Research, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range. In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex’s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows. This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options. Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. As a forward-looking metric, implied volatility in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we’re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general. Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the previous forecast, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond. By latest numbers provided by Farside Investors, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion. Image credit: Farside Investors From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week. Source: Farside Investors, image credit: Bitcoin Magazine On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three. As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to “greed” at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals. Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse. Current fed fund futures project the end of that cycle either in May or in June. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that the Federal Reserve will veer off the money printing course. And at such occasions, Bitcoin price followed suit. M2 money supply measures how much money is available in an economy. Image credit: LookIntoBitcoin.com Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps outpacing revenue, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply. Historical Context and Future Implications As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Within a week from November 18th, 2004, GLD’s total net assets rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock’s IBIT market value of $3.5 billion, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005. Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin’s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin. In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy’s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset. Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, Advisors Preferred Trust set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. Conclusion After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history. On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending. With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy. Barring extreme USG action to sabotage institutional exposure, Bitcoin could even overtake gold as a traditional safe haven asset. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

  "article_detailed_content": "In a landmark ruling, a judge at London's High Court declared that Craig Wright, the Australian 'computer scientist' who has long claimed to be the elusive creator of Bitcoin, is not Satoshi Nakamoto. This decision came following a legal confrontation with the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), seeking to prevent Wright from suing bitcoin developers and requesting a ruling affirming that he is not Satoshi. Judge: I will prepare a fairly long judgement I have reached the conclusions the evidence is overwhelming CSW is not the author of the whitepaper CSW is not satsohi CSW is not the creator of Bitcoin CSW did not author the Bitcoin software — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) March 14, 2024 Judge James Mellor delivered the verdict on Thursday, asserting that Wright is not the pseudonymous inventor of the first and original cryptocurrency. The judge promised to provide detailed reasons for his decision at a later date. The trial unfolded amidst ongoing legal battles between Wright and COPA, with Wright issuing a settlement offer to the alliance and other involved parties. In his proposal, Wright offered to waive his purported database rights and copyrights related to Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bitcoin ABC (ABC) databases. However, COPA rejected the offer, emphasizing that it would imply acceptance of Wright's self-proclaimed identity as Satoshi Nakamoto. Moreover, COPA presented new forensic evidence during the trial to discredit Wright's claim, including the discovery of a Chat GPT forgery by Wright, suggesting that the evidence he presented was fabricated. Despite Wright's persistent assertions, COPA remains steadfast in its position against recognizing him as Satoshi Nakamoto. Last night, COPA detailed more reasons why Craig Wright cannot be Satoshi Nakamoto. \"These points come in addition to a large number of arguments focusing on Wright’s fraud and forgeries ‘on an industrial scale’,\" COPA stated. “12 reasons why Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto” Our trial to prove that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto closes this week.

  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, one of the earliest cypherpunks who helped lay the ideological foundation for Bitcoin, believes that the bitcoin price is on its way to hitting $100,000, and that the move is \"overdue.\" Back has been involved with Bitcoin since its earliest days, contributing to technology like Hashcash, which influenced Satoshi Nakamoto's design of the proof-of-work system that secures Bitcoin and finalizes its transactions. In a recent interview, Back explained his bullish perspective on Bitcoin's potential. \"I think it's kind of overdue already,\" he said about Bitcoin reaching a six-figure valuation. \"Bitcoin has been performing quite well, and many new applications like Strike have come online, providing easy user interfaces. The fundamentals and price have diverged somewhat, so I think the price will catch up.\" Back doubled down on his $100,000 prediction in a post on X saying, \"I think the reason things are muted is that $100k seems way overdue, for a few years now. There's not much bull market euphoria as the $1-5k green candles scroll by. Just tick tock $100k.\" Back's comments come after Bitcoin rallied in 2023 following a brutal bitcoin winter in 2022. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January has since reignited interest in the asset class. The British cryptographer is one of the most respected veterans in the space, making his bullish price prediction noteworthy. In addition to pioneering early digital currency and proof-of-work research, Back is the CEO of Blockstream, a Bitcoin technology company focused on development, but that also has significant investments in mining. With Bitcoin trading around $72,600 when this article was written, a jump to $100,000 would represent a 37.7% gain from current levels. While a six-figure bitcoin price remains controversial, Back believes the network fundamentals combined with increasing institutional adoption make it possible in the years ahead. If the prediction comes true, it would represent a new all-time high for Bitcoin.",

  "article_title": "Bitcoin Has No Top Because Fiat Has No Bottom: Understanding Monetary Debasement",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Bitcoin Magazine"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "MONETARY DEBASEMENT Debasement refers to the action or process of reducing the quality or value of something. When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit. UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead. This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content. Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods. TRADITIONAL METHOD Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation. Clipping involves “shaving” the coins’ edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins. Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins. Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin’s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again. MODERN-DAY METHODS Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they’re all “good” ways of reducing the value of a currency. WHY IS MONEY DEBASED? Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people’s finances — or so it is believed. Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency’s value. Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence. “Inflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.” - Robert Breedlove Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing. Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES The Roman Empire The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure. Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the “denarius” from 94% to 90%. Titus’ brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in “hard money” and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% — a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire. This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued — particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the “Crisis of the Third Century.” During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague. It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system. Read More >> Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire OTTOMAN EMPIRE During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement. HENRY VIII Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding. WEIMAR REPUBLIC During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark’s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful hyperinflation when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD. History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature — or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement — increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it’s being boiled alive if the water’s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn’t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable. The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires. DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability. However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy. In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971. As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it’s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point. EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions. Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term. Higher inflation rates Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency’s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money. Increasing Interest Rates Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns. Deteriorating the Value of Savings Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income. More Expensive Imports A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price. Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government’s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even hyperinflation. SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money — money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be. How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin’s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies. As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin’s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been. Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there’s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as the next evolution of money.",

  "article_title": "Saving Seeds in DNA: Bitcoin as Information",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {

  "article_detailed_content": "I recently converted a Bitcoin seed phrase into a DNA sequence, just because I can. Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into E. coli or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but in toto cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. The Parts of Information Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information: Fidelity Syntax (code or grammar) Semantics (meaning) Pragmatics (action) Apobetics (purpose) Fidelity Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the “Can you hear me now?” commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (Can you hear me now?) The Code and Language Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need. A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be translated to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: Go tell it on the mountain… Va le dire sur la montagne… Ve a contario en la montaña… The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn’t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it’s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the meaning conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not. The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. “Go tell it on the mountain…” is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). Bitcoin as Information Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity – or clarity of transmission – is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin – the pragmatics and apobetics – are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the idea of Bitcoin – the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics – is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the E. coli, too. This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

  "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. It’s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin’s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where “digital gold” is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more valuable commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it’s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was reported that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to reclaim its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy’s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers. It’s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it’s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their prediction that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer released an official memo on the subject. Claiming “serious due diligence” conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from? The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock’s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that reached $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC’s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the international stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people. This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an announcement on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to address the problem of high fees by spinning off a “mini-version” of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC’s fees. It seems that BlackRock’s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential. However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin’s doing so well. ABC News, for example, credits some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin’s price jump. Britain has previously been considered a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) released a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform. ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world’s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it’s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there’s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it’s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Today, more than 25 leading Bitcoin organizations joined forces under the banner of the 'Bitcoin Deserves an Emoji' movement. Spearheaded by Nexo, this global initiative is dedicated to securing an official Bitcoin emoji for digital keyboards everywhere, signaling a monumental step toward recognizing Bitcoin's multifaceted role in society as a revolutionary technology, a form of money, and a cultural phenomenon. “Bitcoin's journey reflects a remarkable blend of innovation and community,” stated Kosta Kantchev, Co-founder & Executive Chairman of Nexo. “It's time its significance is recognized universally, starting with a symbol we all understand - an emoji. Join us in making history.” The coalition comprises a diverse group of participants including prominent entities such as Bitcoin Magazine parent company BTC Inc, Bitget, Brink, Chainalysis, Hacken, Nansen, and Unstoppable Domains. Together, they aim to celebrate and advocate for Bitcoin's integration into the digital lexicon through the universal language of emojis. “Bitcoin is universal money for the world, it needs a universal emoji for every person, young and old to use,” said BTC Inc CEO David Bailey. The campaign kicks off with a 50-day petition hosted on Change.org, culminating in an official submission to the Unicode Consortium within the 2024 submission window. This concerted effort marks a renewed push for recognition, building on previous attempts and highlighting the growing importance of Bitcoin in our daily lives. Emojis have evolved from their origins in Japan in the 1990s to become foundational elements of digital communication, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers. According to Unicode, 92% of internet users worldwide use emojis in their digital communications. The campaign for a Bitcoin emoji is more than symbolic—it's a movement to cement Bitcoin's status as an essential component of modern digital and financial ecosystems worldwide. “Supporting Bitcoin's development has always been about paving the way for future innovation. An official emoji is more than a symbol; it's a nod to Bitcoin's technological impact on the world,” said Mike Schmidt, Executive Director of Brink. The initiative invites everyone to join this community-driven effort. For more details and to become part of the campaign, visit the initiatives website here.",

  "article_detailed_content": "You may have seen that picture of Michael Saylor in a bitcoin-branded van, with a cheerful guy right next to the car door. This one: Ariel Aguilar and La Bitcoineta European Edition at BTC Prague. That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article “La”). Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (Labitconf), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion. The concept drawing for La Bitcoineta from December 2017. Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years. The original La Bitcoineta from Argentina. One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after. Argentinian Bitcoineta after a major accident (no-one got hurt); the car was restored shortly after. Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we’ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world. Follow La Bitcoineta’s journey: Twitter: https://twitter.com/labitcoineta Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/ El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. Salvadoran’s Bitcoineta operates in the El Zonte region, where the Bitcoin Beach circular economy is located. The eye-catching Volkswagen minibus has been donated to the Bitcoin Beach team, which uses the car for the needs of its circular economy based in El Zonte. Follow Bitcoin Beach: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbeach South Africa: Bitcoin Ekasi Late 2021 saw one other major development in terms of grassroots bitcoin adoption. On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the Bitcoin Ekasi project. “Ekasi” is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front. Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own. Bitcoin Ekasi’s Bitcoineta as seen at the Adopting Bitcoin Cape Town conference. Bitcoin Ekasi’s Bitcoineta as seen at the Adopting Bitcoin Cape Town conference. Hermann Vivier is seen in the background. South African Bitcoineta serves the needs of Bitcoin Ekasi, a local bitcoin circular economy in the JCC Camp township. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of Surfer Kids, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide. Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles.

Unlike its predecessors in El Salvador and South Africa, the European Bitcoineta was not funded by a previous team but instead secured support from individual donors, reflecting a grassroots approach to spreading financial literacy. European Bitcoineta sports a hard-to-overlook bitcoin logo along with the message “Bitcoin is Work. Bitcoin is Time. Bitcoin is Hope.” The European Bitcoineta is a Mercedes box van adorned with a prominent Bitcoin logo and inspiring messages, and serves as a mobile hub for education and discussion at numerous European Bitcoin conferences and local meetups. Inside its spacious interior, both notable bitcoiners and bitcoin plebs share their insights on the walls, fostering a sense of camaraderie and collaboration. Inside the European Bitcoineta, one can find the wall of fame, where visitors can read messages from prominent bitcoiners such as Michael Saylor, Uncle Rockstar, Javier Bastardo, Hodlonaut, and many others. On the “pleb wall”, any bitcoiner can share their message (as long as space permits).

As they continue to traverse borders and break down barriers, Bitcoinetas serve as a reminder of the power of grassroots initiatives and the importance of financial education in shaping a more inclusive future. The tradition of Bitcoinetas will continue to flourish, and in the years to come we will hopefully encounter a brazenly decorated bitcoin car everywhere we go.

  "article_detailed_content": "The London Stock Exchange (LSE) released a \"crypto ETN admission factsheet\" showcasing its decision to accept applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs). The move comes as part of the LSE's efforts to expand its offerings and provide investors with exposure to bitcoin. JUST IN: 🇬🇧 London Stock Exchange to start accepting #Bitcoin exchange traded note applications pic.twitter.com/h2XmzXqz2f — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 11, 2024 Bitcoin exchange-traded notes are financial instruments that track the price of Bitcoin and are traded on traditional stock exchanges. By allowing the listing of Bitcoin ETNs, the LSE would be providing investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to BTC through regulated and familiar investment vehicles. \"The proposed Crypto ETN: (a) is physically backed, i.e. non-leveraged; (b) has a market price or other value measure of the underlying that is reliable and publicly available,\" the factsheet stated. \"The underlying cryptoassets must be: (a) (i) wholly or principally held in ‘cold storage’3 (i.e. in an offline depositary wallet), which includes cold staking; or (ii) subject to arrangements that achieve an equivalent outcome to cold storage.\" The decision to accept applications for Bitcoin ETNs reflects the growing demand for BTC investments among traditional investors and institutions. As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to rise, traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring ways to incorporate them into their offerings. The acceptance of Bitcoin ETN applications by the LSE also highlights the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin. With regulatory clarity improving in many jurisdictions, institutions are becoming more comfortable with offering BTC-related products to their clients. Earlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a batch of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which turned out of be some of the most successful ETF launches in history. Just last week, these ETFs did over $33 billion in trading volume, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart.

  "article_detailed_content": "The creator of BRC-20 (Bitcoin Request for Comment 20), Domo, has announced his non-profit foundation is now dedicated to the governance of the BRC-20 protocol. This organization, known as the Layer 1 Foundation (L1F), will collaborate with Ordinals companies such as Unisat and Best In Slot to oversee the protocol's maintenance, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. “The goal is to support the growth of Bitcoin metaprotocols on Ordinals and beyond,” said BRC-20 Creator, Domo. “BRC-20 was an early experiment—but we’re seeing a wave of standards that need tools, infrastructure and support to thrive. We hope to support innovation on Bitcoin in a fair and market-neutral capacity.” Unisat and Best In Slot have been appointed as co-lead maintainers of the BRC-20 protocol and its indexer, operating within the governance guidelines set by L1F. Unisat, known for developing the first BRC-20 indexer in partnership with Domo, has played a pivotal role in listing BRC-20 tokens, which recently reached a market cap of $5 billion. Concerns over the risks associated with a centralized indexer led to the development of a decentralized BRC-20 indexing solution by Best In Slot. The two companies will work together to advance the decentralization of the BRC-20 indexer as co-lead maintainers. Moreover, Domo has appointed five Ordinals companies to the L1F Oversight Committee, tasked with enforcing governance guidelines for the BRC-20 standard. These companies, including Hiro, Allium, ALEX, Oyl Dynamics, and UTXO Management, represent major stakeholders in the BRC-20 ecosystem. The Layer 1 Foundation, operating as a non-profit with 501(c)(6) status, aims to advance the development of metaprotocols on Bitcoin beyond BRC-20. It seeks to provide educational resources and tools to support developers across Bitcoin-native ecosystems in attempt to foster innovation in a fair and market-neutral manner.

  "article_title": "Digital Currency Group Pushes Back Against NYAG Lawsuit ",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Landon Manning"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm, has filed a motion to dismiss a criminal suit filed against them by the New York Attorney General’s office. The legal battle between DCG and the NYAG has been ongoing for several months, and is directly entangled with a dispute between two other prominent crypto firms: Genesis, a now-defunct brokerage firm, and Gemini, exchange and bank. These groups have been entangled in a series of disputes that trace back years, involving dramatic relationship changes and serious fraud accusations. A particularly relevant twist in the whole situation is the fact that the bankrupt Genesis is and has been a subsidiary of the substantially powerful DCG, which holds billions’ worth of assets under management and counts ETF issuer Grayscale as another subsidiary. In other words, untangling the background for all the different players involved here is a fairly significant undertaking, especially considering the fraught environment that currently exists. Not only is the attorney general’s suit directed against DCG, Genesis and Gemini in equal measure, but Genesis and Gemini have also faced off in civil suits independent of this. The NYAG accused these firms in October 2023 of collectively defrauding investors out of more than $1 billion, and the mutual recriminations involved have created a messy atmosphere. To begin, as good a place as any is a recent revelation found in court filings surrounding this dismissal. Specifically, court documents this March have made it public knowledge that Genesis and Gemini considered a merger in 2022. In 2022, DCG CEO Barry Silbert conducted a meeting with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over lunch, to discuss some of the motivations and logistical issues with merging the two corporate entities together. At the time, Genesis was in serious danger of bankruptcy, and its substantial partnerships with Gemini meant that the fallout would likely damage the other company’s business. Gemini had lent substantial funds to Genesis as part of the Gemini Earn program, which Genesis had proceeded to lose. The hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was in charge of this money when it went belly-up in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and Genesis was faced with a $1 billion dilemma. As for the original source of these lost funds, the NYAG has accused the firms of defrauding this money from investors. At the meeting, Silbert made the sales pitch that the two firms should combine, and that they “would be a juggernaut and would be competitive with Coinbase and FTX”. He added that, even if Genesis and Gemini couldn’t reach an agreement on these terms, “there is a ton more Gemini and Genesis can do together and the two companies should be leaning in together, not pulling apart”. Although Winklevoss was allegedly “intrigued” by the proposed deal, it did not happen. Frictions, alongside Genesis’ declaration of bankruptcy, arose in the immediate aftermath. A particular point of friction is found in the aforementioned Gemini Earn partnership, which made headlines this February when Genesis won a court ruling against Gemini. Essentially, Genesis owned a tranche of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that were promised to Gemini as collateral for an exchange of money between the two companies, but Genesis declared bankruptcy before the shares could actually change hands. Since GBTC is unique among the Bitcoin spot ETFs as a pre-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, this tranche of shares had ballooned by early 2024 to be worth more than $1.2B. DCG’s ownership of both Grayscale and Genesis put an extra complication over the issue. Gemini objected to Genesis’ legal right to sell the shares it was promised years prior, and this began a lengthy civil suit. Although the issue was resolved through a series of settlements that allowed Genesis to make the sale and kept both it and Gemini from admitting culpability, the NYAG still filed a complaint alleging that the parties involved were all jointly guilty of substantial fraud. There were more than a billion dollars missing, and the attorney general’s office was growing tired of the mutual recriminations between the relevant parties. Even if Genesis could make enough money from their sale to recoup their investors, that still doesn’t address the issue of criminal activity. A particular illustration of the hostile environment came up when DCG, Genesis’ parent company, disputed Genesis’ own settlement with the NYAG. So, this brings us to the present day. On March 7, Silbert and DCG filed a motion to dismiss the attorney general’s suit, claiming that the allegations against these companies were entirely baseless. In the motion, DCG’s legal team claimed that “The allegations against DCG in this case are a thin web of baseless innuendo, blatant mischaracterizations and unsupported conclusory statements. In search of a headline-worthy scapegoat for losses caused by others, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] wrongfully seeks to portray DCG’s good-faith support of a subsidiary as participating in fraud”. They specifically claim that DCG acted in good faith by funneling money towards Genesis after the Three Arrows collapse, investing “hundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital into its subsidiary during the months leading up to its bankruptcy, even though DCG had no obligation to do so”. The attorney general took a different view, that DCG’s net contributions conceal a large drain of Genesis’ money at one crucial moment: DCG took their money back, Genesis declared a “liquidity crunch” and did not allow users to withdraw their crypto, Genesis went bankrupt immediately. The burden of proof is on them, however, to demonstrate that this was a deliberate fraud tactic. As of yet, there is no way of knowing what a judge will think of DCG’s proposed defense or motion to dismiss, or if a settlement is feasible in the event that the motion to dismiss is denied. However, one unambiguously good sign has come out of the morass: Gemini announced its plans to fully reimburse the allegedly defrauded users of the Gemini Earn partnership with assets in kind. In other words, these users had Bitcoin stolen from them in 2022, and Gemini has made commitments to pay them back, accounting for Bitcoin’s price jump since then. This has tacked on another $700M to the price tag of reimbursing over $1B in assets, and is a clear sign of confidence from the company. Source If nothing else, this decision to reimburse users like this is an impressive display of sincerity and good intentions from Gemini. Gemini is named as a co-defendant on all the legal documents submitted by Silbert’s legal team about the NYAG suit, and would also benefit greatly from seeing the suit dismissed. This gesture of good faith might not be enough to clear the air for DCG and Genesis, but it certainly couldn’t hurt anyone’s chances of escaping the whole fiasco without a criminal conviction. Although Gemini failed to halt Genesis’ attempt at getting the money from GBTC sales, Gemini is still a successful and prominent exchange. Apparently, it was able to float a compensation of this size without relying on the GBTC tranche. It’s anyone’s guess as to how the suit will proceed in the coming months. When the NYAG first filed a complaint after the first round of settlements, it seemed clear that the prosecutors were quite fed up with the acerbic attitude of these former business partners. Nevertheless, Gemini’s restitution plan will surely go a long way in proving their intention to do right by their users. If nothing else, it shows that they’re proactive in taking the issue seriously. We’ll have to observe the situation carefully as it develops, but it does seem clear that the mutual loathing and underhandedness displayed so far has not been rewarded. The broader digital asset space has periodically been filled with shaky businesses and outright scams, but eventually they all fall apart. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has come by its success legitimately. When the dust settles, the biggest winners might actually be the defrauded users, who collectively will see their expected payout nearly double thanks to Bitcoin’s own strength. Compared to those kinds of gains, it’s hard to imagine a scam working much better.",

  "article_title": "$KARMA is the largest fungible token airdrop in Bitcoin history",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Metagood"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "REDMOND, WASHINGTON 4 March 2024 - $KARMA released the largest fungible token airdrop in Bitcoin history to over 61,000 wallets on February 27. In true Web3 tradition, the collection was launched by a seven-member $KARMA Council, bringing together 10 leading Ordinals communities behind $KARMA’s mission. The $KARMA Council’s airdrop aims to foster a sense of community amongst early Ordinals participants and bolster the burgeoning ecosystem. Strength in Numbers: Growing the Ordinals Ecosystem $KARMA is a token launched by a seven-member council, including four representatives from the OnChainMonkey (OCM) community: Soldman Gachs (@DrSoldmanGachs), Fitzy (@fitzyOG), Rabbi (@RabbiGains), and Drheref (@DrHeref). They are joined by BennyTheDev (@rarity_garden) and Alex Philippine (@Skrylabs) from Tap Protocol, bringing their technical expertise. Jason Fang (@JasonSoraVC) from Sora Ventures, a lead investor in Metagood, creators of OnChainMonkey, and the Tap Protocol is the final member of the Council. Fostering strong relationships with other communities is something that the $KARMA Council believes will be an essential step in achieving the $KARMA community’s goals. Accordingly, a significant number of tokens have been earmarked for future ‘Karmunity’ Incentives. The $KARMA community incentive pot will continue to activate future partnerships or activations that will help to further expand the $KARMA and Ordinals community. This could include rewarding valuable community members, partnering with additional projects, or general growth initiatives. The Ordinals Community Airdrop With this in mind, the $KARMA Council decided to airdrop 49,968,900 $KARMA tokens to communities within the Ordinals ecosystem. This was designed to push towards $Karma Council’s goal of expanding both the OCM & Ordinals ecosystems. The Council sought to take an objective selection process. For this initial airdrop, they selected the top 9 collections by market capitalization at the time of the snapshot at Block Height 828,888 (4 February 2024). The 9 communities eligible to receive $KARMA tokens in the Community Airdrop are: Bitmap (https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap) Bitcoin Punks (https://bitcoinpunks.com/) Bitcoin Puppets (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets) Bitcoin Frogs (https://bitcoinfrogs.com/) Nodemonkes (https://nodemonkes.com/) OMB (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb) RSIC (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic) PIPE (https://trac.network/Pipe/) TRAC (https://trac.network/) Rewarding the OCM Community A total of 560 million $KARMA tokens are being allocated to holders of OnChainMonkey NFTs. Eligibility for the OnChainMonkey community was based on assets being migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Except for the OCM Karma collection (https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey), which has had their allocation of $KARMA reserved until that collection is upgraded to Bitcoin. Since the snapshot has not been completed for OCM Karma, people can still purchase the assets on ETH and when they migrate to Bitcoin, they will be eligible for the $KARMA airdrop. \"Trac is the governance token for Tap Protocol, the first decentralized indexer economy on the Ordinals protocol enabling similar features of ERC20 but on Bitcoin L1. The TAP standard that created $KARMA was conducted by members of the OCM community but has now expanded towards 9 other Ordinals communities,” Jason Fang, founder of Sora Ventures said. “Tap protocol contains many more features compared to BRC20 that enables developers and projects to stake, send cost effective airdrops, and enable token distributions that make building on Bitcoin most cost effective, safer, and scalable.” \"$Karma embodies the spirit of innovation and community, serving as a beacon for the next generation of decentralized ecosystems. We're thrilled to champion this groundbreaking initiative led by our OnChainMonkey community members and investors,\" remarked Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood. \"At OnChainMonkey, we’re a community of builders and innovation and impact are woven into our DNA. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized finance, $Karma is poised to redefine collaboration, economic empowerment, and impact, with strong communities early to Ordinals at its core.” Technical Milestones for Airdrops The airdrop of the $KARMA tokens was performed in an efficient manner utilizing “Tapping,” a core feature of the TAP Protocol. “Tapping” is a process of transacting that makes it considerably cheaper and faster to distribute tokens to a large amount of addresses. Using the existing BRC-20 standard, conducting an airdrop for 61,000 wallets would have required over 122,000 transactions. The KarmaCouncil was able to complete the entire airdrop using under 55 transactions, therefore setting a precedent for the future of community inclusions for future airdrops on Bitcoin. BRC20 requires 2 transactions for a single transfer of tokens between 2 parties. The TAP Protocol allows for many transfers within 2 transactions. 1 transaction with many receivers at once and a 2nd transaction to approve the transfers (called \"tapping\"). This reduces the costs for airdrops significantly in comparison to BRC20 as there is almost half of the transactions needed. It also helps to put the Bitcoin network under less stress due to lesser amounts of transactions required. TAP Protocol's token authority feature allows it even to reduce it further using only 1 transaction, which makes it also attractive for simple individual transfers. Token authorities require additional setup configurations however, while airdrops work out of the box. A Note on Tap Protocol and the Technology Trac Core is an indexing solution (created by Trac Systems) designed to enable decentralized tracking of Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin. Trac Systems is also the creator of the Tap Protocol. Creating the $KARMA tokens on the Tap Protocol was conducted by the community. Tap Protocol is a similar to BRC-20 and allows for features and hooks into DeFi that otherwise wouldn’t be possible natively. In layman-terms, Tap Protocol can be seen as BRC-20 “on steroids”. Taps airdrop feature is cheap because it combines receivers of different token types and amounts into 1 inscription. About $KARMA (https://karmacoin.xyz/) $KARMA is more than a token; it's a commitment to growth, community, and innovation. Designed as a catalyst to expand the OCM and Ordinals ecosystems, $KARMA is set to redefine engagement and opportunity for the entire Ordinals community and beyond. $KARMA is a network of founders, builders, industry leaders and seasoned collectors in the Ordinals ecosystem. About OnChainMonkey (www.onchainmonkey.com) Created by Metagood, OnChainMonkey is the first non-fungible token (NFT) 10,000 profile picture collection created on-chain in a single transaction on Ethereum. OnChainMonkey marked history again, becoming the first 10k PFP NFT collection inscribed on Bitcoin in a single inscription.

  "article_detailed_content": "Have you fallen into the ‘rabbit hole’ of covenants? Interviewer: Hua, freelance writer, independent researcher. X: @AmelieHua Interviewee: Poly, a Controls Specialist, maintains multiple Distributed Control Systems (DCS's) and has worked with other five nine systems (99.999% uptime availability). X: @Polyd_ Covenants are an old yet fresh topic. As early as 2013, developers began discussing this topic, and in recent years, multiple BIPs aimed at implementing covenants have been proposed, sparking intense debates and making it one of the hottest topics. Covenants warrant serious discussion due to their powerful capabilities. They are considered to bring new possibilities to the programmability of Bitcoin and are believed to enable smart contracts. For Bitcoin, this is undoubtedly a double-edged sword. In this article, we will explore what covenants are, how they work, their robust functionality, and their significance for Bitcoin. While discussing details, this article often uses CTV as an example, but CTV is not the only method of implementing covenants. This article delves into the exploration of covenants but also magnifies a slice of Bitcoin under a microscope for observation. Through this observation, we can understand how Bitcoin operates at a granular level, comprehending both its capabilities and limitations. Understanding what it cannot do is as crucial as understanding what it can do because only then can we choose the right path for building on Bitcoin. 1. Hua: Before discussing covenants, clarifying two issues related to Bitcoin may be necessary, which can help us better understand covenants. We know that Bitcoin uses a scripting language, and it is known that scripting languages support the implementation of smart contracts. However, in reality, smart contracts have not been implemented on the Bitcoin main chain. This inevitably creates a sense that implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin faces some insurmountable obstacles, and it seems impossible on the Bitcoin network. However, many people may not be aware that although Bitcoin can be programmed using a scripting language, the set of opcodes is extremely limited. This limited set of opcodes restricts the programmability scope of Bitcoin, meaning that, although the scripting language can implement smart contracts, programmers do not have sufficient \"tools\" to implement smart contracts. Poly: Definitely, Bitcoin Script can be considered limiting as it can only perform the basic operations such as making simple payments. Some of the reasons that people may find it “limiting” is that it doesn’t have a global state, it’s not considered turing complete, it uses a UTXO-based system (which has “value blindness”) instead of an account-based system. The last big reason is that very little data from the blockchain itself can be integrated into contracts causing blockchain-blindness. This has created a lot of challenges over the years as people have worked around these limitations. We’ve also had a semantic shift with the term “smart contract” to mean one specific thing when you should consider the lightning network a production of many smart contracts formed by many individuals. Those multi-sigs with hashlocks and timelocks are not only smart contracts, but also have time-based covenants. The problem is, just as you mentioned before, because Bitcoin only has simple opcodes to perform just the basics, if you attempt to scale beyond two people in a smart contract, you can get either a lot of bloat for an on-chain footprint or the things you want to do just might not be possible. This strict limitation comes from a few places, I think the biggest being that when the inflation bug occurred back in 2010, Satoshi had disabled a whole list of higher order opcodes including OP_CAT which would’ve allowed us to create more dynamic smart contracts via transaction introspection. BCH has since overcome this limitation within their own script, showing that Script isn’t as weak as everyone assumes, just that Bitcoin has always been slower due to its decentralization and coordination is near impossible except over long periods of time. We’ve also barely touched on Taproot and Tapscript which will alleviate a lot of the footprint concerns and allows for new behaviors such as BitVM by rolling up the contract into the signature and you only reveal as necessary. Hua: Why are there strict limitations on opcodes? Can you use OP_CAT as an example to help us understand this point? Poly: So OP_CAT is deceptively simple, it will take two strings and add them together. It was originally disabled because it had resource issues and could be used to cause nodes to crash, but I’m not sure if that’s the full story as Satoshi set the 520 byte stack limit and disabled OP_CAT in the same commit so there could be more to it than just simple resource exhaustion. But just to give a short list of what OP_CAT can perform: CTV/TXHASH covenants, verify SPV proofs, double-spend protection for 0-conf TXs, 64-bit arithmetic, vaults, quantum-resistant signatures. The list goes on, with OP_CAT alone, it can emulate both CTV[CheckTemplateVerify] and TXHASH style transactions. The only issue is it’s highly inefficient in the manner that it performs these actions that might be possible, but that could just preclude these transactions from being desirable except by users of scale such as custodians. 2. Hua: Let's talk about another \"limitation\" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin only supports \"verification\" as a form of computation and can't do general-purpose computation. We also know that, for example, smart contracts on Ethereum contain rules for state transitions. It completes the state transition through computation, enabling the functionality of smart contracts. In comparison, Bitcoin can't do general-purpose computation, meaning it cannot achieve state transitions through computation on its own. Is my understanding correct? Poly: Yeah, I’d agree that’s a simple summary of the current state of things. Bitcoin could be made to support computational transactions and the line can become quite thin when covenants and state transitions are involved, but those proposals aren’t as well researched and might not be something that’s considered desirable. I’m actually not that much of a fan of the way Ethereum does things. Due to it being computational in nature with the verification built on-top, if I attempt to perform a trade, my window could shift and I could “fail to trade” but the transaction for the attempt to trade was still valid so i still paid for fees which wasted my money on what i’d want to consider a failed transaction and wasted blockspace for someone else. Another weird aspect are the Oracles in Ethereum. Oracles must pay gas to update their oracle prices whereas in Bitcoin DLC’s, the Oracle are blinded and are just providing a signature and can’t be “pinned” due to a change in fees nor can Oracles target specific contracts. Earlier I discussed all the downsides to the UTXO model compared to the account model and global state model, but what allows the UTXO model to shine is parallelism. The only concern you have is the child transactions to the same UTXO, nothing else matters, this allows the system to scale much better. 3. Hua: Let's start discussing covenants now. What are covenants? Poly: Covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred. The word covenant seems to carry some sort of connotation with it so it helps to demystify it and explain it as simple locking mechanisms you can place only on your *own* coin. We have two covenants already inside Bitcoin and they power the Lightning Network, CSV [CheckSequenceVerify] and CLTV [CheckLockTimeVerify]. Some just call these opcodes “smart contract primitives” as they’re simple time locks, but they can also be classified as time covenants. CTV [CheckTemplateVerify] is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade and is included in BIP 119. It is different from CSV and CLTV, you can think of CTV as a “TXID [Transaction ID] lock” or “UTXO lock”, only these TXID’s can be made from this lock. For CTV, we refer to this TXID lock as “Equality Covenants” as the resulting transactions must equal to the original transactions that were committed. It’s also called a deferred commitment covenant, as you can see that your UTXO has been committed to, but it isn’t yet placed on-chain. The most known alternative is SH_APO [Any Previous Out or AnyPrevOut] which focuses on the payout commitment being ensured while allowing the pay-in method to be flexible. A few others discussed are OP_CCV [also known as MATT], OP_EXPIRE, TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY. Hua: When you mention \"covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred,\" can I understand it like this: Covenants are a method of specifying how funds can be used, or in other words, it's a way of restricting where funds can be spent. Poly: Yep, it effectively earmarks the UTXO to be distributed in a specific manner, once you commit to it, you can't take it back, it's now consensus bound, and only its new owner can decide how to spend their funds. When a UTXO is created on-chain, our instinct is to assume that a single private key is holding that UTXO in place. But if it was a CTV bound UTXO, when the UTXO is spent, you'll see an extra 32 byte hash paired with the new transaction that represents the hidden state that was inside the original UTXO. Hua: You've mentioned \"TXID lock/UTXO lock\" multiple times. Can I understand it like this: To understand how CTV achieves their functionality, we need to understand what TXID lock is and how it works. TXID lock is a key mechanism. Poly: Yes, It creates a strong foundation to build further schemes. The TXID is determined by the contents of a tx. And if you can add inputs to a tx, you can manipulate the TXID. CTV makes you lock the number of inputs and outputs. This is how we ensure that CTV commitments are trustless, if the TXID could be malleable, you could potentially be able to steal someone’s funds. Once you have a TXID locking mechanism, you combine it with other locking mechanisms such as the time locks to build even greater smart contracts. 4. Hua: Why do you think covenants are a rabbit hole? Poly: I call covenants a rabbit hole because there’s so much you can do with simple restrictions on transactions such as a time lock or a TXID lock. We’ve managed to build the entire Lightning network with simple time locks and while it isn’t perfect, it is the only truly decentralized L2 in existence. I don’t like how it’s slowly shifting towards being custodial focused, but that’s exactly why I’ve started down this rabbit hole to begin with: To make our smart contracts more powerful. We refer to the TXID lock as a Template. With Taproot, we gained the ability to have signature aggregation. With Templates and CTV, we gain the ability to have transaction aggregation. CTV serves as a replacement for a pre-signed transaction oracle, which eliminates the trust and interactivity requirements needed to create more sophisticated smart contracts that are needed for things like vaults and payment pools. The vaults and payment pools that you can make with CTV are technically possible today, but currently they’re precluded by the trust or interactivity needed to make it work. Moreover, with CTV, we can build channel factories, additional layer 2 solutions such as Ark, Timeout-Trees, Stakechains or Surfchains, and JIT fidelity bond solutions such as PathCoin. Probably my favorite feature is Non-Interactive Channels [NIC’s] that we’ve also been referring to as Cold Channels. The basic idea is to take a normal lightning channel and simply place it in a CTV template. What makes this different from a normal lightning channel is that neither party actually needed to be online to create this channel. So if I need a channel with another person, I don’t need them to be online to create it, I don’t even need to tell them I made it until I’m ready to spend from it! This allows for cold storage capability on lightning because I don’t need a watchtower nor a node to safeguard my funds in any channels that aren’t yet active. Third-party coordinators can also establish NIC’s for two individuals so there’s a lot of flexibility in what’s possible. As it stands, CTV won’t allow you to build a DEX on-chain, but I’m not sure if that is such a bad thing as people are currently trying to build DEX’s off-chain using the Lightning Network as it is today. I think this ties back into the “Verification vs Computation” discussion, how much do you really want on-chain versus how much do you need to verify on-chain. One concern I have about on-chain DEX’s, besides the excessive on-chain updates driving higher fees, is MEV. We’ve already spotted some MEV from BCH’s DEX’s transactions and as the market matures, this is bound to get worse. Hua: Can you give an example to help us understand how CTV works? Poly: Let’s say I am expecting to receive 5 BTC, as of right now, the only thing I can do is receive the payment and verify it on-chain. With CTV, I can commit to future addresses or to people and reduce it down to a simple pubkey that I give to my payer to pay me. They don’t know the details of it so it remains private to everyone but me. Once I can confirm that they’ve paid me, all of the actions I took using the CTV template have now also taken effect. So if I had elected to create a channel with Bob, once Alice pays me, the channel with Bob is now committed, even though the channel with Bob is nowhere to be seen on-chain, it is only accessible by my template and the transaction that Alice had created. It’s only known to me until I share the channel details with Bob. Once I do share the details with Bob, we can use the channel as normal. When we cooperatively close the channel, instead of needing to place an open channel details on-chain, we just place the closing channel on-chain. This allows us to perform transaction cut-through, reducing the total number of transactions that need to be on-chain by at least half for layer 2 solutions. The opening portion only needs a commitment, what we really care about are the closing details. If this was a shared UTXO with multiple people, we could collaborate to close our transactions together as well, reducing the number of on-chain transactions even further. 5. Hua: As you mentioned before, we can introduce different opcodes to implement covenants. Poly: So if we re-introduced OP_CAT, I think it would allow for nearly every type of covenant possible as you can emulate any form of introspection for TXHASH. The more limited method would be to introduce opcodes representing the explicit behavior desired like with CTV, CSFS or CheckSeperateSignature. CTV is the ability to do deferred outputs. CSFS is the ability to do deferred signatures so you can defer the payment itself. They sound similar and in fact they work well together as building blocks to enable LN-Symmetry, but the commitments are happening at different levels. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY both enable introspection and serve the same purpose, but TEMPLATE KEY uses a single-byte mode while TXHASH uses multi-byte flags. This allows for much more powerful capabilities inside script and smart contracts, but many are concerned about the side effects it could have. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY are more of a CTVv2, something that would make CTV more powerful and expressive. Hua: I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be a significant disagreement about whether to support the implementation of covenants. However, in comparison, there seems to be more significant divergence among people regarding which method or set of opcodes to add to implement covenants. Poly: I think a large part is there’s different camps of thought. There’s a lot of the lack of understanding the intent behind each proposal as they have different goals in mind and are designed in completely different ways. A lot of developers have only had their eye on Lightning and how it’s to evolve, they tend to favor opcodes like SH_APO since it enables LN-Symmetry. For a lot of developers that don’t particularly like Lightning due to its limitations such as Inbound Liquidity constraints or the requirement to be online, they tend to favor opcodes like OP_CAT, TXHASH as more expressive scaling solutions. The developers that prefer CTV are more neutral and are looking at it from a systems point of view, it doesn’t necessarily do any one thing perfectly but it greatly enhances everyone’s ability to do their preferred thing, whatever it may be without introducing risks that can’t be measured since it doesn’t introduce introspection. 6. Hua: Before discussing covenants, we talked about issues related to opcodes in scripting language and the problem of limited computation leading to state transition. We already know the relationship between covenants and opcodes. Now, let's delve into the issue of state transition. I'm not sure if looking at covenants from the perspective of \"state transition\" is correct, but this perspective truly fascinates me. Without covenants, the scripting language's main function is to retrieve transactions' signatures and verify them. The transaction can only be completed when the private key is correct, and there is no intermediate state. With covenants, a transaction can be completed when certain conditions are met. Moreover, a transaction can only be completed when specific conditions are satisfied (not just the correctness of the private key). Can we understand it this way: Covenants indirectly provide conditions for state transition. Poly: The covenant is the template shell or the \"state\". Inside of it, you're going to need to make time locks and other functions to enable the desired functionality that you’re wanting, be that a vault, lightning channel or some other layer 2 solution. So CTV allows for the state creation to occur, but you have to dynamically rebuild the state at each transition to keep it in homeostasis, we call this meta-recursive. Whereas something like SH_APO allows you to create a state and then periodically update that state, making it recursive. CTV can also create a chain of transactions that would allow you to “step-through” that state. A good example to think about is Ark, it’s a giant smart contract, almost like a giant coinjoin and the one running the protocol creates a new state [or rounds as it’s called] every few seconds to facilitate participants to pay others as needed. Once the Ark operator is ready, they will send a transaction to the mempool to commit the current state to on-chain. These on-chain placeholders can be thought of as the “transition states.” The operator has to constantly recompute new states to present to the Ark participants and what’s sent to on-chain is the verification of that state. Hua: Can we understand it this way: Covenants implement a form of smart contract based on verification rather than computation? Poly: Yes. Definitely. This smart contract is just comparing a transaction to an associated sha256 hash. Block speed verification would actually increase since there’s no signature operations. Hua: One direction of development for blockchains is modularity, including off-chain computation. However, Bitcoin seems naturally designed for off-chain computation, appearing behind but actually leading the way. What do you think? Poly: Time is a flat circle. It’s crazy how it seems like we’ve come full circle to what’s wanted in a blockchain. Bitcoin still seems to have some modularity issues and footprint issues. I wish we had better side-chains that weren’t simply multi-sig solutions and used actual cryptographic means to secure one’s funds and allowed for Unilateral Exits. I think that would help push the boundaries on Bitcoin’s modularity. Taproot has allowed for even more off-chain computation with things such as BitVM, which would allow us to compute almost anything off-chain. But unfortunately, it can’t emulate things inside Bitcoin such as CTV so it seems we still have progress to make. 7. Hua: What possibilities can be achieved by combining covenants with other opcodes like DLC? Poly: So DLC’s have a few problems that would be fixed with covenants such as increasing the flexibility of the parameters of the DLC by making many price points [if we’re wagering on the price of something such as Bitcoin]. Another one is that hardware wallets [HWW] can’t interact with a lot of DLC’s, the signing rounds for DLCs and attempting to do it with HWWs causes DLCs to take several minutes to open. With CTV, this delay to enter a DLC can be reduced down to seconds. 8. Hua: Are there any other points you'd like to introduce to the readers? Poly: We went over a lot of concepts. We touched on how it can be used to mitigate excessive blockspace demand and potential ddos attacks. We discussed how people could save space by making Non-Interactive Channels. I think another good one to discuss is the \"L2 exit problem\". If we managed to get everyone off of the L1 layer and get them onto a large L2, there's currently no good way to get people off that L2 in an expedited manner. We could think of that L2 as Lightning [we call the potential mass exodus on Lightning, the \"Thundering Herd problem”], or we could think of Coinbase, Binance or Liquid as the L2. There are people who hold claims to Bitcoin, but their only way to actually acquire that claim is by submitting a transaction to get it placed on-chain. There's millions of people on Coinbase, I have no idea how to get them off of there and onto Bitcoin in any orderly fashion in today's environment. There would be a mempool backlog of 6 months attempting to get people off the exchange. CTV can fix this. Make an Ark or a Timeout-Tree with CTV. The exchange could even offer the service directly. Everyone could be offloaded from the original \"shared UTXO\" that was under Coinbase's consensus and pushed into a \"shared UTXO\" with a consensus of their choice, be it a simple pool or a large Timeout-Tree. This is where it really wrinkles the brain, this was a pure L2 <> L2 conversion. There was no intermediary step requiring me to go down to L1 first. And I can continue repeating this process indefinitely, using any layer of my choice. There isn’t a need to return to the base layer unless I was forced there such as from an uncooperative closeout from my channel or perhaps an unvaulting from my vault. The Ark and Timeout-Tree pitfall is that they have rollover requirements, you have to move your funds every few weeks or months or you forfeit your funds. This isn’t an ideal solution for long-term funds but works great for any short term holdings and larger markets. I'd like to provide a full list of every concept that’s been developed using CTV and its ability to simply aggregate pre-signed transactions: Non-Interactive Channels, Timeout-Trees, Ark, Darkpools, Payment Pools, Payment Channels, Ball Lightning, Congestion Control, Dpool's, Compaction, Tree Swaps, PathCoin, Stakechains, Surfchains. But don’t think of these as all independent Templates, if there’s a feature of one that you wish to include in another, you can create your own custom Template to try and find your desired behavior.

  "article_detailed_content": "The bedrock of Bitcoin self-sovereignty is having control over your private keys. Without this, in one way or another, you are relinquishing control of your money to someone else. “Not your keys, not your coins” as the saying goes. A counter-intuitive aspect of Bitcoin for people who aren’t familiar with the technical underpinnings of it is “where” your Bitcoin actually is. When people think of a wallet, they think “the place where I keep my money.” Your bitcoin wallet doesn’t actually “hold” your Bitcoin, it just stores your private keys. Your Bitcoin is just entries of data on the blockchain hosted by everyone participating in the network. When you go to spend your bitcoin, what you are actually doing is proposing an update to the data stored on the blockchain. A private key is how the protocol ensures that you, and you alone, can authorize an update to the blockchain that spends your Bitcoin. So what are your private keys? Just very large numbers. Extremely large. This is a private key in binary: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 256 random 1s and 0s. This random number is what ultimately secures your Bitcoin. It might not look like much, but its randomness is what ensures your wallet’s security. There are almost as many possible Bitcoin private keys as there are atoms in the visible universe. That is how many numbers a computer would have to count through to generate and catalog all the private keys potentially possible. As long as the process used to generate the keys is truly random, your keys are safe. This is what a private key looks like in hexadecimal (binary uses two digits to encode a number, 1 and 0, hexadecimal uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F): E2D97BC144089EBB5773FFABA5D3A729BD187D79A5E6E836DC68C7A24F6AB36A This is what a private key looks like in uncompressed Wallet Import Format (WIF): 5KYC9aMMSDWGJciYRtwY3mNpeTn91BLagdjzJ4k4RQmdhQvE98G WIF format is how everyone used to interact with their private keys in the early days of Bitcoin. In this era, you could generate one private key at a time, and then you’d generate the public key from that. The process of generating a public key is essentially just the multiplication of very large numbers but there is a bit more to it than that.. All public keys are an x and y point on a graph showing a very, very large curve that loops back on itself. On the graph curve, in Bitcoin’s case Secp256k1, there is a point called the “generator point.” This generator point can be thought of as the “base point” on the Secp256k1 curve. It is integral to the process of generating keys and signing with them. This is what the generator point is for Bitcoin’s curve: G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 To generate the public key from your private key, you take the private key you generated and multiply it by the generator point. That’s it. This now establishes a point on the graph with a mathematical relationship to the private key you generated that only you know. This is an uncompressed public key showing both x and y points: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED It is very common to “compress” public keys in the rare chance you interact with them to just store the x coordinate with a byte to tell you whether the y coordinate is negative or positive. That shortens it considerably: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED When you go to sign a transaction with your private key, it once again boils down to essentially just multiplication. By generating a random number (the nonce), and using that and your private key to essentially multiply the hash of the transaction you are signing, you produce the signature (which is made up of two values, r, and S). This allows someone to run an algorithm to verify the message was signed by the appropriate private key without revealing that key. The thing guaranteeing only you can authorize spending your Bitcoin is essentially just the multiplication of very, very large numbers. If you aren’t all that familiar with these concepts before reading this, all of this probably seems somewhat intimidating. Binary? Hexadecimal? Graph points? How do you back up a WIF? Since the development of more intuitive ways of handling this data, most users are unfamiliar with these complicated formats. Most likely, you have more experience with word seeds, also known as seed phrases. BIP 39 Mnemonic Seeds Mnemonic seeds, or seed phrases, were created to address the problem of the experience of interacting with your private keys. As we discussed earlier, private keys are ultimately just a long series of 1s and 0s that are randomly generated. Imagine trying to create copies of this and ensure you didn’t make an error transcribing it: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 All it would take is a single error copying one digit to render a backup of your keys useless. This is where mnemonic seeds come in handy. 256 consecutive 1s and 0s in a row is not a human-friendly way to interact with sensitive information. Recording this number incorrectly means losing access to your account. truck renew fury donkey remind laptop reform detail split grief because fat That is much easier to deal with, isn’t it? Just 12 words. So how does that work, going from a bunch of random 1s and 0s to a string of words that actually make sense to you? An encoding scheme, just like binary or hexadecimal! Each of those 12 words in that mnemonic seed above is a binary number in an encoding scheme mapping specific strings of 1s and 0s to words. If we look back at the WIF private key example earlier, that was simply a number encoded in a specific encoding scheme, in that case, base 58, which uses every number and letter of the alphabet except 0 and 1, and O and l (case sensitive). The exclusion of those characters was done specifically to make transcription errors unlikely by confusing a 1 for an l, or a 0 for an O. bech32 and bech32m used by Segwit and Taproot take this to the next level by using only this set of characters (qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l). Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39), introduced a standardized encoding scheme where each word in a specially crafted dictionary is alphabetically mapped to a binary number from 00000000001 to 11111111111. The demonstration seed above maps to this: truck: 11101001001 renew: 10110110001 fury: 01011110011 donkey: 01000001001 remind: 10110101110 laptop: 01111101000 reform: 10110100010 detail: 00111100010 split: 11010010001 grief: 01100110100 because: 00010011110 fat: 01010011011 In just binary it looks like this: 11101001001 10110110001 01011110011 01000001001 10110101110 01111101000 10110100010 00111100010 11010010001 01100110100 00010011110 0101001 1011 There are 2048 words, each mapped to a specific 11 digit string of 1s and 0s, specifically to make it easier for people to interact with their private keys. When you generate a random number for your private key, your wallet cuts that number up into chunks of 11 digit binary numbers and maps them to the BIP 39 Mnemonic dictionary. It’s still the same large number, but now you can read it as English words. Since your brain is much more accustomed to this format than long strings of 1s and 0s, this drastically reduces the odds of you writing down something wrong and losing your Bitcoin in the process. You may have noticed that in the raw binary encoding of the word seed above, there are four digits (1011) sitting off on their own, and the last “word” is only actually 8 digits. That is a checksum to ensure that a seed phrase is valid. When you generate your random number, there aren’t enough digits to map it exactly to 12 (or 24) words. The wallet hashes those existing digits you generated and takes the first few digits of the hash to add on to the end of your random number. This gives you enough digits to map to the last word. This last word allows you to perform a safety check on copies of your seed. If you enter your mnemonic seed into a wallet incorrectly, the checksum will not match. Each 12 or 24 word seed has multiple potential valid checksum words, but if the last word doesn’t match the checksum of a correct seed your wallet will warn you it is invalid. This gives people an intuitive yet still mathematical way to guarantee their backups are correct, unlike the messy process of transcribing and backing up the raw binary numbers. The selection of the specific words on the list even went so far as to guarantee that none of the 2048 words have the same first four letters. This was done to reduce the likelihood of people making transcription errors by confusing similar words and winding up with an incorrect backup of their private keys. Translating these words into a set of multiple private/public keys is quite simple. Your mnemonic seed is taken and hashed using SHA512, which outputs a hash of 512 individual 1s and 0s. Half of that output is used as an actual private key, and the other half is used as input to SHA512 with an index number and the existing private or public key to generate a new key pair. You can do this as many times as you want to generate new private/public keys that can all be recovered from your single mnemonic phrase. This ensures that you can manage your private keys as easily, and safely, as possible with the lowest odds of making a mistake that loses your money. And all of it was done using math! Hopefully, now you have a good understanding of why people say that Bitcoin is money ‘secured by math.’",

  "article_detailed_content": "“It is in the nature of a system of government control of business to aim at the utmost centralization…In voting for government control of business the voters implicitly, although unwittingly, are voting for more centralization.” - Ludwig Von Mises One of the most underestimated threats that modern society faces is the ever tightening grip of centralized control. History has shown us time and again that centralized control inevitably devolves into tyranny, eroding the foundations of liberty upon which free societies are built. The 10 planks of communism, as outlined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in The Communist Manifesto, that serves as the blueprint for transitioning society to a collectivist system cannot be implemented without centralization first occurring; due to the fact that communism at its core seeks to abolish every form of private ownership while enthroning the state as master of all. The sad reality is that these planks have been gradually implemented over the years by most countries in the world, thus progressively eroding free markets and the overall liberty of their citizens. The centralization of speech online is the most recent threat that has emerged as a potent tool for state control. Ironically, this phenomenon resembles the realization of plank 6 of the communist manifesto, which advocates for the \"centralization of the Means of Communication and Transport in the Hands of the State.\" As commerce and communications via online platforms grows, these two very important aspects of human existence become centralized in the hands of the big tech companies that own these platforms. In our cancel culture driven world, the increasing overlap between centralized social media platforms and financial services has significantly increased the risk of absolute censorship; where violating the constantly changing \"community guidelines\" can lead to one becoming persona non grata and being immediately deplatformed. Without decentralized alternatives, censoring any speech or transaction that is deemed “undesirable” becomes a trivial matter. Big tech social media giants acting as the de facto thought police and enforcers for the state, wield immense influence over the flow of information, and suppress every form of dissent through the threat of financial strangulation when one doesn’t toe the line. There are two major factors that undergird this power to silence dissent online: Centralized nature of the social media platforms Centralized payment processors like PayPal that dominate these platforms For individuals who rely on social media for their livelihood, deplatforming represents a significant threat, not only to their ability to express themselves freely but also to their income. Self-censorship naturally becomes the norm and this is even more dangerous as it creates the illusion of alignment with the current thing of the day. Thankfully, Bitcoin has made these payment processors irrelevant and due to it being fully decentralized, neutral, apolitical and censorship resistant; it’s a viable alternative. Code is Speech In 2013 Cody Wilson, the pioneer of the world's first 3-D printable gun, received a letter from the State Department demanding removal of blueprints for his plastic firearm, the Liberator, or risk facing jail time and millions in fines. In 2015 Wilson's organization, Defense Distributed, filed a lawsuit against the State Department, alleging that prohibiting the publication of his plans, which are essentially computer code, constitutes a prior restraint of free speech rights, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US constitution. The dispute revolved around the State Department’s claim that posting 3-D printable gun files online constitutes a potential breach of arms export controls, a controversial set of regulations known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The history of ITAR has been marred by controversy and contention. In the 90s, it was used to target cryptographers (aka cypherpunks), classifying strong encryption tools as military munitions. After the source code for PGP was released and printed out as a book, it immediately fell under First Amendment protection. Despite this seemingly obvious fact, its inventor Phil Zimmermann, was subjected to a grueling three-year Department Of Justice (DOJ) investigation during these Crypto Wars, which was subsequently put to bed without any indictments. In 1995 cryptographer Dan Bernstein also sued the DOJ, arguing ITAR violated his First Amendment rights, and won the case. This was the landmark case that designated code as speech. Despite the State Department's two-year enforcement of ITAR against Defense Distributed, it failed to stop the proliferation of its 3-D printable gun files online. Instead, concerns over censorship spurred over 100,000 downloads of the Liberator blueprint in just two days! Despite removal from Defense Distributed’s websites, the file quickly spread to platforms like the Pirate Bay, making erasure nearly impossible. Attempts to ban speech in the digital age are not only absurd but futile because of its ability to manifest in infinite forms.The historical example of RSA's classification as munition highlights the futility of restricting information as epitomized by printing forbidden information on t-shirts. Information must be free. Export-controlled RSA encryption source code on a T-shirt turned the shirt into a restricted munition. In an interview I had with Jessica Solce, the film maker and executive producer of Death Athletic: A Dissident Architecture a documentary that profiled Cody Wilson and the 3D-printed guns movement; when commenting on the significance of Cody’s battle with the government she said, “Cody entangled the First and Second Amendment by pushing guns into the digital era. He utilized the burgeoning technology of 3D printing to reduce a gun to code. This WikiWeapon, the Liberator, was directly inspired by Wikileaks, and immediately threatened the Government’s axis of power and control. It was a masterful play that antagonized the military complex and forced the conversation of gun control into the age of the Internet.” In other words, Wilson didn’t just challenge the military industrial complex’s monopolization (i.e., centralization) of firearms manufacturing. His stance extended to firmly resisting instances of government overreach that sought to regulate and control information pertaining to emerging technologies, which in and of itself is another form of centralized control. A condition which George Orwell described in his book 1984 as, “an endless present in which the party is always right”. Interestingly Jessica also encountered firm resistance from centralized content distributors and media outlets when the film was released, as it definitely didn’t fit the “approved narrative” because on the surface it looks like a film about guns but it’s really a story about the power of free speech and free access to information in the internet age. Clearly the time is ripe for more decentralized content distribution and streaming services that are integrated with Bitcoin payments, think Angel Studios on a Bitcoin standard. This will empower content creators to not only profit from captivating content while simultaneously challenging centralized control over information, ensuring artistic creative control, prioritizing truth, and preservation of free speech., but I digress. In July 2018, three years after Defense Distributed challenged the State Department’s actions in court, they accepted a settlement offer from the State Department, including a license to publish its files and a payment of nearly $40,000. When questioned about the settlement, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert justified the decision, stating that the Department of Justice advised settling the case to avoid likely loss on First Amendment grounds in court. Information must be free. This and many other ongoing legal battles faced by Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed underscore important aspects of individual rights and freedom of speech that must be defended. These battles serve as a reminder that: The state seeks to control and capture new technologies by “any means necessary” Lawfare and bureaucracy are the weapons of choice in achieving this aim More decentralized technological tools and protocols that incorporate Bitcoin as the monetary layer need to be built to ensure the preservation of liberty and individual sovereignty. Jessica echoed similar sentiments when stating one of the biggest takeaways that she hopes people will get from Cody’s story; “The takeaway is to build however you can - community, resources, decentralized systems, archive history and information. The battle for information, the era of the Internet and the battle for its control must be understood as a type of new frontier. Many are against second amendment rights so I’d ask them are they truly against the free and open dissemination of information as well? Do they like someone telling them what they are able and not able to understand and read?” I couldn’t agree more. Decoding Free Speech in the Digital Age Just like PGP or Cody’s 3D-printable gun designs, Bitcoin at its core is fundamentally open source code, thus Bitcoin is speech. In the words of Beautyon,“There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be text. It is all text, all the time.” The ruling in the Bernstein v. The DOJ case set a precedent that recognized code as protected speech under the First Amendment, and therefore this protection also directly applies to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a messaging system and functions much like email and text messaging, all of which transmit messages. Its primary aim is to definitively confirm an owner's control over a cryptographic key, represented as a block of text, enabling access to a corresponding entry in the global Bitcoin network ledger. The point here is that restriction of communication using programming languages is an example of a prior restraint of speech. Attempts to ban Bitcoin are just as ludicrous as banning memorizing 12 words in your head or outlawing certain musical scores .Does this mean that the powers that be will not try to outlaw Bitcoin and increase their grip on the narrative through censorship? You bet they will! Just like they have declared war on free speech online by rebranding it as a war on “misinformation and disinformation”, propaganda is also being disseminated by the corporate media that paints Bitcoin mining in particular, as being harmful to the environment, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked along with the usual “Bitcoin is for money launderers and criminals” Time fails me to discuss the latest proposed FinCen regulations and the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law which are all very subtle but sinister attempts to gradually cripple Bitcoin in the name of combating money laundering and enforcing know your customer policies.. In the same vein, digital ID’s and central bank digital currencies (CBDC’s), are more than just surveillance tech; but are also weapons for destroying free speech and independent thought. The ultimate road to serfdom. While legal challenges against all these forms of government overreach noted above will be launched and likely won, they take a long time to settle and are usually very costly. The best solution is to develop more open-source, decentralized technological tools that will thwart and defang any attempts by the state to censor speech. As big tech companies pay lip service to freedom of speech while simultaneously implementing “freedom of speech not reach policies, online discourse increasingly mirrors the authoritarian control described by Ludwig von Mises when he said: “At every instant of his life the \"comrade\" is bound to obey implicitly the orders issued by the supreme authority. The State is both his guardian and his employer. The State determines his work, his diet, and his pleasures. The State tells him what to think and what to believe in”. This is even more true today, than it was in 1944 when it was written. Without the freedom of speech we lose a critical part of what it means to be free human beings. Today we may witness the battles between Defense Distributed and the State Department, Wikileaks and the DOJ, Bernstein and the DOJ, and so on. However, one thing remains clear: the players may change, and the time frames may differ, but the underlying struggle has always been centralization versus decentralization, a battle between those who seek to control speech and those who seek to liberate it. Satoshi Nakamoto, Julian Assange, Aaron Schwartz and many others are some of the martyrs of freedom that contributed immensely to the preservation of free speech in our society today. Bitcoin is the best shot that we have at safeguarding the future from being suffocated by the censorship industrial complex leviathan. This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

  "article_detailed_content": "Pioneering bitcoin wallet company Oyl has secured a $3 million pre-seed investment from a variety of investors, including UTXO Management and Domo, the creator of the BRC-20 token standard. The investment marks a noteworthy shift in cryptocurrency investment trends, with several Ethereum NFT funds making their first foray into a bitcoin-centric business. Arca, which led the round, is a venture firm with a history of investments in Ethereum NFTs and alternative blockchains. Now, the company is extending its portfolio into the bitcoin sphere through Ordinals. Other investors include Foresight Ventures, Taproot Wizards CEO Udi Wertheimer, and distinguished NFT funds Kanosei and FlamingoDAO. “The speed of development on Bitcoin is primarily constrained by lack of infrastructure — we’re in a race to see who can create the most usable backend tooling for developers to build on,” said BRC-20 creator Domo. Based in Brooklyn, NY, Oyl is set to launch in coming weeks, aiming to become the first bitcoin wallet to incorporate \"in-wallet\" trading of bitcoin and Ordinals. The app is designed to support market aggregation for BRC-20s and facilitate swap integrations with the \"bitcoin DeFi\" protocol Omnisat.io. “We want to support the new surge of development on Bitcoin — starting with builder tools like RPCs, all the way to consumer platforms like the Wallet,” Alec Taggart, Oyl CEO, said in a statement. Arthur Hayes, whose family office Maelstrom also participated in the funding, noted the growing recognition of the untapped potential within the bitcoin DeFi sector. “Funds that have historically been focused on other chains are now seeing what’s possible on Bitcoin with Ordinals,” said Arthur Hayes. “The infra winners in ‘Bitcoin Defi’ are yet to be determined — it’s a huge opportunity.” In addition to being on the verge of launching its wallet, Oyl has introduced Sandshrew, a product that offers developer tools such as Bitcoin Core, Esplora, and Ordinals endpoints.

So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.” ― Milan Kundera, Ignorance Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. A coping mechanism, an inspiration, or a manipulative rhetorical tool. For quite some time, the inhabitants of the West have found themselves conscripted onto a battlefield of the mind. Society has been reshaping itself or being reshaped at a frenetic pace for decades now. Nostalgia has proven itself to be a potent weapon in the arsenals of every faction on that battlefield. The power of contrast should never be underestimated. Humans are living, breathing, pattern-recognition machines. We cannot help but compare proposed plans and present circumstances to historical outcomes. This is normal, this is healthy: It lets the human mind achieve some measure of confidence in predicting what happens next. The human mind loathes unpredictability more than anything else. The unknown noise in the dark is far more terrifying than the wild animal on the ridgeline that you can observe and predict. The regime knows that contrast holds such power, because it allows for critique. Such was the power of Florida during COVID, for instance. Without a state that was free of lockdowns and mandates, foisting the same circumstances on an entire population across the board would have caused less negative sentiment of those measures. This was the real reason for the mass psychosis and peer pressure of that era. It’s much more difficult to make someone take a bite of a turd sandwich insistently offered to them when there are other options. Click the image above to subscribe! “The past is a candle at great distance: too close to let you quit, too far to comfort you.” ― Amy Bloom, Away “Hireath” is an old Welsh word that describes a feeling of homesickness for something that no longer exists or perhaps never did. Millennials stand astride the old world before 9/11 and the new one, with memories of a higher-trust society with much more prosperity and unity than what we have now. These feelings are amplified by the fact that due to their age, the entirety of the era before the shift was viewed through the rose-colored glasses of childhood. Essentially, millennials are too young to remember the 1992 L.A. riots or the Oklahoma City bombing with any sense of clarity or context, but old enough to remember when innocence was valued and optimism about the future was commonplace. This contrast between a less anxious past and a present that consists of never-ending psychological warfare can be many things. The past can be pointed to as a critique of how far we have fallen and thrown in the faces of the ruling order as dissent. It can also be a coping mechanism, both healthy and unhealthy. From vaporwave to homesteading, from filtered edits of 1980s Miami to thinking about the Roman empire, the aesthetics and contrast of the past are coming back with a vengeance as the present is too Lovecraftian to personify. My personal favorite example of this has been the meteoric resurgence of the band Creed. While the band broke up in 2004, they have miraculously been memed back to life. A video of the 2001 Thanksgiving halftime show they performed in Dallas went viral. Taking place just two months after 9/11, that snapshot in time captured and distilled both the optimism of the time and the resilience of its people. The video entered the narrative bloodstream, provoking remarks about how “we used to be a real country” and with it, the demand that we deserve something better than this because we once had something better than this. Shortly afterwards the Texas Rangers began to streak toward the World Series after a rough start. The team gave the credit for their comeback to Creed, which they began to play constantly in the locker room for motivation. Home games in Dallas blared “Higher” and “My Sacrifice” prompting the fans to sing along in a massive chorus. The Rangers would go on to win the World Series, with a reunited Creed attending the game with Jerseys and a newly announced tour across the United States. The winner of this season of The Voice was a burly white guy belting out Creed’s “Higher” during his finale. In a dark time of “Its So Over” lies the burning embers of a “We Are So Back”. “Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.” ― Albert Camus, The Rebel Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. But the regime understands the power of contrast, too. The solution to this problem has been to tear down or change the past. Beloved franchises that influence culture are butchered ignobly by the likes of Kathleen Kennedy. Films and shows of historical fiction are made to impose contemporary norms of sex, diversity, and sarcastic cynicism upon our past. Suddenly there have always been black Scandinavians, African Roman legionnaires in Britain, and the great men of history have their conquests and achievements “reimagined” to give someone else the credit. Wikipedia is edited, and classical literature and its heroes are “reimagined” and judged through a contemporary lens. Visual media is obviously the most powerful avenue with which to do this. A series like Stranger Things seeks to recreate the most familiar possible representation of the 1980s, only to subtly slip in the values the regime wishes to promote as if this state of affairs has always been the norm. Yellowstone receives critical acclaim only for tough cowboys and patriarchal dynasties to spend spare moments reinforcing that a good feller ought to be a feminist. Like an angler fish with a pretty lure and a poisonous bite, designed to entertain you just enough to where the subversion can slip through. This adds a certain sense of urgency to stopping the rot. It is why we must promote and share the best parts of our past, even if it’s something like a halftime show played by Creed. Those of us who remember the time before the world moved on must pass down what was normal and what was good to the generations born inside the throes of hell world who don’t know any better. It is our duty to shout from the rooftops that this isn’t the best we can do, and it’s not the best we’ve ever done. Even if the past must stay in the past, it provides a blueprint for the right kind of future. This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s “The Inscription Issue”.

  "article_detailed_content": "Leading Bitcoin advocates and key politicians will convene at the National Press Club Ballroom in Washington D.C. for the second annual Bitcoin Policy summit hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute. The bipartisan policy event will address the increasing integration of Bitcoin and digital assets into the political landscape of the United States while identifying important policy measures that interact with this burgeoning ecosystem. The upcoming summit on April 9, 2024 will bring together key players in the Bitcoin ecosystem covering a diverse range of subjects including: energy and the environment, national security, perspectives on Bitcoin and democracy, and how to counter the rise of digital authoritarianism. Confirmed speakers include Avik Roy (President, Foundation for Research On Equal Opportunity), Mike Brock (CEO of Block’s TBD), Sarah Kreps (Director, Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute) and Matthew Pines (Director, Security Advisory at Sentinel One). The full speaker list can be viewed here. Further speakers will be announced prior to the event according to Bitcoin Policy Institute representatives. At the inaugural Bitcoin Policy Summit on April 26, 2023, policymakers including US Senator Ted Cruz, US Senator Cynthia Lummis and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer met with Bitcoin industry representatives to discuss the importance of Bitcoin from a national and economic security perspective, as well as the importance of Bitcoin in the context of human rights. Notable Bitcoin industry representatives included Alex Gladstein (Chief Strategy Officer, Human Rights Foundation), Jack Mallers (Strike CEO), and Roya Mahboob (CEO and Co-Founder, Digital Citizen Fund). During the 2023 summit, Senator Ted Cruz made headlines when revealing that he was: “incredibly bullish on Bitcoin specifically”, perhaps indicating his preference for Bitcoin over alternative digital assets. He also remarked: \"I own a little more than 2 bitcoin, and every Monday I own a little bit more. I bought the dip.\" With bitcoin trading at approximately $28,000 per coin at the time of his statement in 2023, Cruz’s bullishness appears to have been well-founded.

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethiopia is emerging as Africa's most promising bitcoin mining hub, poised to claim a significant share of the global hashrate as the hum of miners reverberates across the globe. - Jaran Mellerud & Kal Kassa Recent attention from a Bloomberg article and the announcement of a bitcoin mining investment by the Ethiopian Government signals a newfound global spotlight on the Ethiopian bitcoin mining sector. The potential of Ethiopia as a bitcoin mining hub resides in the promise of a mutually beneficial relationship between the nation and the industry. In this article, we delve into the transformative power of bitcoin mining to uplift Ethiopian society, unveiling five compelling avenues for prosperity in this East African gem. Bitcoin mining monetizes Ethiopia’s surplus electricity Bitcoin mining allows Ethiopia to transform excess electricity into a valuable commodity, fostering economic growth while maximizing the utilization of its abundant hydropower reserves. Ethiopia's allure for bitcoin miners is undeniably anchored in its abundant hydropower resources. Nestled within the country’s mountainous terrain lies the source of the Blue Nile, accounting for a staggering 85% of the Nile's water. This abundant water wealth translates into the immense potential for hydropower generation, making Ethiopia a prime destination for electricity-intensive industries like bitcoin mining. Kal Kassa, Bitcoin Educator at BitcoinBirr and Alen Makhmetov, CoFounder of Hashlabs Mining at “Exporting energy through the internet” a Hashlabs Mining event in Addis Ababa With the potential to harness an estimated 60 GW of hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar, Ethiopia stands as a powerhouse that could theoretically become capable of generating more than three times the electricity consumed by the entire bitcoin mining network. Presently, the nation has tapped into a fraction of this potential, having an electricity generation capacity of 5.3 GW. Assuming a capacity factor of 40%, Ethiopia's current electricity generation capacity translates to a potential of 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year under normal rainfall conditions. Comparatively, in 2022, the country's electricity consumption amounted to only 14.7 TWh, leaving approximately 20% of the electricity generation potential unutilized. This number will be even higher during particularly wet years. As if Ethiopia's electricity surplus wasn't already substantial, the nation is on the brink of nearly doubling its generation capacity with the commissioning of The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This awe-inspiring project will claim the title of Africa's largest hydropower plant, boasting an impressive nameplate capacity of 6.5 GW. With an anticipated capacity factor of 29%, sustained by the continuous influx of water to the dam, the power plant is projected to yield approximately 16.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually. This output is equal to 10% of the consumption of the Bitcoin mining network, underscoring Ethiopia's potential to become a dominant force in both energy production and bitcoin mining. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam The forthcoming Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's anticipated 16.5 TWh of electricity production will propel Ethiopia's total potential generation to a staggering 35.1 TWh annually under typical rainfall conditions. With current consumption at 14.7 TWh, the surplus electricity generation will amount to an impressive 20.4 TWh, corresponding to a percentage electricity surplus of 58%. Ethiopia is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is set to see a surge in electricity demand, necessitating the expansion of its hydropower infrastructure. However, the non-modular nature of hydropower plants often leads to overbuilt capacity, resulting in surplus generation until demand catches up. The flexibility inherent in bitcoin mining makes it the perfect match for Ethiopia's surplus electricity, offering a means to monetize until residential, commercial, and industrial consumption catches up. Once demand increases, miners can adapt by relocating or contributing to the financing of new power plants. Without Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia faces the prospect of significant electricity wastage until demand aligns. By seizing the opportunity to leverage its abundant energy resources, Ethiopia positions itself for sustained economic growth, with initiatives like Bitcoin mining serving as a catalyst for optimizing resource utilization and driving prosperity. Bitcoin mining increases Ethiopia’s exports and access to foreign currency Ethiopia grapples with a daunting challenge: a staggering trade deficit. With more dollars flowing out than in, the nation faces mounting difficulties in importing vital goods and services. Compounded by a struggling currency, ironically named the Birr, Ethiopia's citizens are vulnerable to soaring inflation rates. In 2022, Ethiopia imported $23 billion worth of products and services while exporting just $11 billion, leaving a cavernous trade deficit of $12 billion. This deficit is straining the nation's ability to meet debt obligations, showcased by the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a potential bailout. Luckily, Ethiopia's abundant electricity surplus presents a promising opportunity for foreign currency generation through exports. However, traditional avenues like selling electricity to neighboring countries have been limited due to low demand and weak economies in the region, yielding modest returns of around $70 million annually. Enter Bitcoin mining, a revolutionary solution that transcends geographical constraints by allowing electricity to be converted directly into digital currency. With minimal investment in transmission infrastructure, Ethiopia can tap into the global Bitcoin network as a lucrative consumer of its surplus energy. Jaran Mellerud, Alen Makhmetov, and Marek Šafárik, Cofounders of Hashlabs Mining By embracing Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia diversifies its export income and reduces reliance on neighboring countries for electricity sales. With the ability to export electricity through the Internet, the nation gains a stronger negotiating position and can demand higher prices for its exported power. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Yodahe A. Zemichael of the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) highlighted the government's motivation of legalizing the bitcoin mining industry, citing that companies pay in foreign currency for the electricity they consume in data center operations. Considering the official bitcoin mining tariff of $0.0314/kWh, Ethiopia stands to generate a substantial export income of $640 million if it sells all its excess electricity to Bitcoin miners. Furthermore, by self-mining with the most efficient machines available, the country could potentially yield an export income of $3.9 billion, making Bitcoin mining a transformative force in Ethiopia's economy and potentially its largest export industry. This tantalizing prospect underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin mining for Ethiopia's economic landscape. Indeed, it's prudent to adjust our expectations to account for real-world factors such as the Bitcoin halving and Ethiopia's likely utilization of a portion of its electricity surplus for other purposes. A more realistic estimate of Ethiopia's export income from Bitcoin mining would likely fall somewhere between $640 million and $3.9 billion, settling in the middle at around $2.3 billion.This figure still positions Bitcoin mining as the largest export industry in Ethiopia, representing a significant economic opportunity for the nation. A $2.3 billion boost in export income would indeed wield transformative power for the Ethiopian economy, providing a vital injection of foreign currency to strengthen the national currency and facilitate easier access to essential imports. Moreover, reducing dependency on foreign lenders would enhance Ethiopia's sovereignty and bolster its economic resilience. At this pivotal moment, Ethiopia faces the imperative of addressing its trade imbalance and charting a course for economic prosperity. Embracing bitcoin mining as a means to export surplus electricity through the internet offers a groundbreaking opportunity to unlock Ethiopia's economic potential. Indeed, it could represent the greatest economic opportunity of this generation for the country. Bitcoin miners can build out electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia The challenge of electrification in Ethiopia is stark: only 54% of the population currently has access to electricity, with rural areas significantly lagging behind urban centers. While cities boast a 94% electrification rate, rural areas struggle at just 43%. The Ethiopian Government has set an ambitious goal of achieving near-universal electrification by 2030, but this endeavor faces significant hurdles. The electrification challenge in Ethiopia, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. While the country boasts significant electricity generation capacity, the main hurdle lies in transmitting and distributing this energy to remote communities. Bitcoin miners offer a potential solution by financing and constructing substations in rural areas with surplus electricity, such as those near The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These substations could serve not only miners but also nearby residents, potentially providing electricity to entire towns. A substation in Africa This approach, akin to efforts by Gridless in Kenya, could complement Ethiopia's goal of near-universal electrification by 2030. Unlike in Kenya, where Gridless focuses on building power plants with bitcoin mining as an anchor customer, Ethiopia already has sufficient power plants. Thus, Ethiopian miners could focus on building out substations to improve the population’s access to electricity. Moreover, the increased revenue from selling electricity to miners could enable Ethiopia to invest in new electrical infrastructure, including substations, transmission lines, and distribution networks. As a result, bitcoin miners could indirectly finance the expansion of electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia, contributing to electrification for Ethiopians and fostering socio-economic development nationwide. Bitcoin mining brings tech jobs to Ethiopia Ethiopia, boasting the second-largest population in Africa with 122 million inhabitants, predominantly comprises a youthful demographic. Regrettably, the nation faces a significant challenge of high unemployment rates among its youth. Introducing the bitcoin mining industry could potentially provide avenues for accessing tech jobs, not limited to mining facilities but also encompassing the broader bitcoin economy poised to develop alongside the foundational growth of the bitcoin mining industry. Bitcoin mining will bring a significant amount of jobs to Ethiopians across many talents and skills. On this, Advisor at Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, Kal Kassa says: “500 jobs per bitcoin miner is a high goal to meet and I doubt this rumor we’ve been hearing is an honest reflection of the government’s intent to regulate and add thresholds to investment. That being said, facilities with investment over $100 million are very likely to require more than 500 personnel, contractors, vendors, and local suppliers. In fact, we see more than double that in interest from technicians and electrical engineers. Training and certifying skilled talent will be a pillar of our objectives in Ethiopia and I have no doubt we will inspire a generation forward.” Additionally, Hashlabs Mining has sponsored the onboarding of hundreds of wallets at ALX Ethiopia, DevFest’24, and the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) in keeping with this vision. Kal Kassa with Elias Abebe, COO of Hello Solar Technology PLC Kassa continues, “For programmers and devs building, I urge them to build a profile and open a free lightning wallet with sost.tech and similar initiatives to get paid in bitcoin. BTrust Builders may also be a solid destination for experienced computer engineers and enthusiasts. Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, and various additional sponsors, will be supporting these educational and vocational efforts via the funded Hashlabs Education Fund and BitcoinBirr.” BitcoinBirr, a community of educators and innovators, boasts a strong vision for providing bitcoin learning materials across several languages and regions. Telegram is the most popular platform for communication among its mods and members. Most recently Kal Kassa gave a presentation titled “Mining Bitcoin of the Nile River” at Bitcoin Oasis in Dubai. In the next few weeks, and with sponsors from across the world, BitcoinBirr would like to complete the bitcoin training of all 2,000 staff at INSA, in addition to other institutions and organizations that have requested bitcoin education. Beyond hackathons and presentations, Hashlabs Mining is committed to the training of talent in tech. Private sector leaders like Mehrteab Leul and Associates (MLA), Yingke Consultants, Grant Thornton Advisory, MMCY Tech, Boseti Energy Exploration, Meedo Records, HabeshaView, Flawless Events, Education Matters Addis, Tryst Cafe, Ethiopian Airlines and Sheraton Addis are highly appreciated and we honor your friendship during our work in Ethiopia. Ethiopia can leverage mining to build a bitcoin treasury The Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the country's sovereign wealth fund, has been rumored to partner with a Chinese bitcoin and data mining group. As per a LinkedIn post shared by EIH’s official account, we understand the project will consist of a multi-million dollar investment. Jaran Mellerud, Cofounder of Hashlabs Mining at an event in Addis Ababa Given the natural series of events that occur with bitcoin miners, the accumulation of bitcoin may be a way for Ethiopia’s treasury to maintain a balance of BTC on behalf of its country. As methods for collateral and proof of reserves develop within the bitcoin “space”, these reserves may be used to prove creditworthiness. The events surrounding Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also be instructive to Ethiopians. There is also a sentiment from some Bitcoiners that governments should not be involved in bitcoin mining. And that bitcoin is an experiment by cryptopunks and libertarians to create tools for the free market. Given Ethiopia's recent communist history from 1974 to 1991, Ethiopia’s citizens and leaders may need a refresher course on the Austrian School of Economics. Conclusion We are witnessing significant development in real time. It’s difficult to point towards a singular event or catalyst. But we are at the center of a very serious and interesting moment in our history. The moment we are experiencing allows value to be generated from an open and free community of bitcoin miners. And this novel technology allows humanity to preserve value across time and space. As we dive into the future, it may also be important to note the need for humility. It should be remembered that over the past few years, Ethiopians and East Africa have witnessed a haunting amount of death and destruction, often self-inflicted and many times manipulated on the world stage. We can’t bring back our fallen friends. Like our dear brother Tekeste Sebhat Nega, an early bitcoiner and a visionary. He lost his life in the last few weeks of 2020. An energetic and smart young man died in a senseless civil war. And there are many more stories like him. The entire country is going through a syndrome of sorts, so let’s remain humble as we carry the burden. Let’s move with purpose, passion, and dignity toward a future that values math and physics more than fiat and violence. That is our hope for ourselves and that’s the energy with which we will operate in Ethiopia. This is a guest post by Jaran Mellerud & Kal Kassa.

  "article_detailed_content": "With the kickoff event 'Bitcoin im Bundestag,' Bitcoin has entered the political discourse in Germany. Roman Reher of Blocktrainer, the largest German-speaking Bitcoin YouTube channel, and Kristian Kläger, CEO and founder of terahash.energy GmbH, delivered two formidable introductory presentations in the German Parliament. Since German politicians still mainly associate Bitcoin with criminal activities, money laundering, and climate damage, the objective was to nurture a better understanding of the unique opportunities Bitcoin has to offer. Privacy was paramount to kickstarting the event. Given that Bitcoin remains a complicated subject in German politics, ensuring full privacy for attending MPs and their staff was crucial to spare them potential reprimands from their party leaders. The event was well-attended, also by visitors from outside. Since MPs preferred to take a backseat on the main floor, ordinary visitors were invited to fill the front seats. Overall, the event was a big success, and more Bitcoin events in the Bundestag are in the pipeline. While cameras were not permitted during the main event, a few exclusive moments later allowed for capturing select opinions on camera. Joana Cotar is the founder of the initiative 'Bitcoin im Bundestag.' As a party-independent MP, she has the privilege of putting Bitcoin on the agenda, for example, during debates about the introduction of the digital Euro. As a party member, this would not have been possible. Still, her former affiliation with the right-wing AfD poses challenges too. In German politics, guilt by association is a strong mechanism, and no party wants to collaborate with the AfD. It creates a political vacuum and has led to discussions within the Berlin Bitcoin community. According to her it is good to remind oneself that Bitcoin is apolitical, uncensorable, and free money, and even your worst enemy can use it. Also in the German parliament, Bitcoin is a bottom up movement, and according to Joana Cotar, the staff of the MPs play a crucial role in getting the topic on the agenda. They work long hours with the MPs, and are also often consciously encouraged by Members of the German Parliament to explore new topics. In the following interview, Joana Cotar provides unprecedented insights into the workings of German politics. She discusses the free access banking lobbyists have to the German parliament, their strong influence on MPs, and articulates concrete requests such as making Bitcoin legal tender, allowing for self-custody, promoting sustainable Bitcoin mining, and urging opposition to the introduction of the digital Euro.

  "article_detailed_content": "In a momentous surge, Bitcoin has officially smashed through its previous all-time high, surpassing the $69,000 mark. This milestone comes as Bitcoin continues its remarkable ascent after spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, leading to a consistent large influx of capital into BTC. OFFICIAL: #BITCOIN REACHED A NEW ALL TIME HIGH ABOVE $69,000 pic.twitter.com/DccMr0Gnc5 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 5, 2024 The Bitcoin market witnessed a flurry of activity as BTC surged to its new peak as BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF did over $1 billion in trading volume for the sixth consecutive day yesterday. Bitcoin's previous all time high of $69,010 happened almost three years ago on November 10, 2021, 846 days ago. For the month of February, Bitcoin had the biggest green monthly candle in its history, rising almost $20,000 that month alone. To put into context how bullish that month was price wise, the bear market bottom for bitcoin was ~$16,000, meaning bitcoin pumped almost $4,000 more than that alone in February. JUST IN: #Bitcoin had its biggest monthly green candle EVER in February 🤯🚀 pic.twitter.com/BsaCIXGTJx — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 1, 2024 Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been fueled by a variety of factors, including increasing institutional adoption, growing interest from retail investors, and broader acceptance by traditional financial institutions. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns have propelled demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. US spot Bitcoin ETFs had their second biggest day in terms of trading volume yesterday, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock's ETF was responsible for $2.4 billion of the $5.5 billion traded yesterday. Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought over 30,029 BTC, while miners only mined 6,160 new BTC. This massive demand and very limited supply of bitcoin being created every day has been the main driver causing bitcoin's price to increase dramatically. Here's the weekly summary (Feb. 24 - March 1, h/t @HODL15Capital). Keep it simple: There is more demand than new supply. pic.twitter.com/ighWC0hOOi — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) March 2, 2024",

  "article_detailed_content": "“Let him cook” has been the expression that all of the young whippersnappers are using lately when describing somebody or something that shouldn’t be interrupted, because they are on a roll. I know this piece will come across as annoying to some, especially because I have only been bullish on bitcoin with some gusto for the last couple of months (though I first pointed it out to my readers in December 2022), but as a newfound member of the church of bitcoin community, I’d be remiss if I didn’t try out my voice a bit. I apologize in advance for opining on things that many members of planet bitcoin have talked about and debated ad nauseam for the last decade. But, one way or another, I have to get myself up to speed, and I do that best cathartically through writing. As a result, you, the reader, are left here to suffer. So, you know, don’t forget to renew your paid subscriptions to Fringe Finance. Enough with the prelude — we all know it has been a breathtaking week for bitcoin, which is up well over 20% in just the span of days. \"Oh my fuck.\" - Bubbles, Trailer Park Boys The moves have done well to spin up even more interest in the cryptocurrency than there was over the last month with the launch of the ETFs. Hell, even Morgan Stanley came out this week and said they were thinking of throwing their hat into the ring and launching a bitcoin fund of their own. I’ve gotten a number of phone calls and texts about bitcoin, and I’m not even a prominent member of the community, nor am I a well-known bull. And so I can’t even imagine the outreach that maximalists and longtime advocates have seen this week. Undoubtedly, it is exciting, and I can’t even imagine how long people have been waiting to savor this moment, after years of abuse from family members and uninformed assholes like myself, as well as general doubt about the asset class. But, if there is one small lesson I have learned from decades in the capital markets that I think translates across asset classes, it is to celebrate modestly and prepare for the worst. That may seem like the furthest thing from people's minds this week, but for me, it has always been the best way to savor success. Many people who listened to the podcast that I did a couple of weeks ago with Peter McCormack know that it was arrogance and hubris that turned me off from bitcoin to begin with. Perhaps that is my fault for not having an open enough mind and not doing enough of my own work – it’s a mistake that saw me miss out on large gains. But today I’m speaking as one of the people who can visualize bitcoin as a long-term success and are genuinely excited about onboarding the rest of the world. My Twitter feed over the last week has been replete with people triumphantly celebrating, bragging, and taking shots at those who doubted that the price would ever go back up again. Here’s one example from my brother James Lavish, who I know well enough to know he won’t mind me using him as an example because he knows I respect the shit out of him. Behold Exhibit A: James talking shit to Vanguard. Does James have a point? Yes, he does. Could be wind up being right 50 years from now also? Yes, he could. But is it karmically sound to taunt the $7.7 trillion bear? To me, not really. I’d rather just savor the satisfaction of the temporary dub quietly. Everybody is well within their rights to celebrate this short-term action anyway they would like, but what I’m suggesting today is that karmically and psychologically, the less you force the issue and the more humility you show, the more evenly and consistently bitcoin will thread itself through the rest of the world. Think of this: celebrating making an exorbitant amount of money or rage-tweeting about your success is going to do two things: (1)it’s going to turn off people like myself who think that behavior is generally synonymous with fraud and (2) it’s going to excite investors with lower-than-average sophistication who will look for quick riches and won’t be the steady hands bitcoin needs to become a perpetual success. Rather, what I’m suggesting is to allow the news media to do what they do (generally be useless and chase stories long after they’ve happened) and allow people to come to the realization about bitcoin the same way that I did: on my own, once I felt as though I wasn’t being suffocated with the idea by outside sources anymore. My interest in looking at bitcoin this go-round in early 2024 was completely organic: the news coverage of it had died down, and I had blocked or unfollowed enough people who were hyping it that I could have some clarity and some peace of mind about it when I sat down to consider how it worked, seriously, for the first time ever. It was that calm, relaxed, blank slate that allowed me to grasp the relatively complex concepts of how it worked and believe in it the way that I do now. I think given the astronomical week that we just had, we’d be better off to “act like we’ve been here before” and to remember that sometimes the more you push an idea, the more people are prone to resistance than barking like hyenas and taunting people. If bitcoin had a $50 trillion market cap, that’d be a different story. But we’re still in the early stages of this courtship with the rest of the world and, like any good relationship or friendship in your life, there has to be a genuine organic interest in “showing up” to the idea of it happening. All of those who have been smothered by a partner or a friend in the past know that all it does is create distortions and unhealthy dynamics. Such delicate things cannot be forced, but rather, accepted willfully like a slow, purposeful deep breath outside on a winter day. This is not to say that I don’t believe this week is the beginning of much larger adoption that would likely drive the price of bitcoin higher. As I said on the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast, I believe that there is at least one, if not several, nation-states looking at putting bitcoin on their sovereign balance sheets, and that this will kick off a period of game theory for the digital asset revolution the likes of which we haven’t seen yet. Just days after I said that, yesterday Edward Snowden came out and postulated the same. Try to keep up with me, Eddie. But in all seriousness, we know what will happen if the price continues to rise. The hype will continue to flywheel further, as will interest and adoption. People will have the same realization that it took me a decade to figure out: this thing simply isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. But if you ask me, especially given the fact that we all know how quickly price moves can whipsaw back to the downside in the short term, I think the community would be well served to focus less on spiking the football here and more on how we will be able to clearly explain and convey the transformation that is unfolding before our eyes in a calm, measured, and comprehensive way. After all, whose questions do you want to deal with on the next 20% overnight whipsaw lower: unsophisticated maniacs or measured investors who already know and expect the volatility that is a certainty. And the more time we spend setting reasonable expectations that bitcoin can easily exceed, instead of overpromising and underdelivering, the less time we have to brag about being right. The journey is the reward. Or, as the bible says: “When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.” — Proverbs 11:2 But I think if Jesus were around today, he would simply tell us to “let bitcoin cook”.

  "article_detailed_content": "At Bitcoin Atlantis, non-profit organization Generation Bitcoin announced the launch of the Bitcoin Students Network (BSN), an initiative aimed at empowering students to learn about and contribute to the Bitcoin space. BSN, presented by Generation Bitcoin, operates as a one-stop platform providing logistical, educational, and financial resources to students interested in Bitcoin. BSN's primary goal is to connect students globally, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among young individuals passionate about Bitcoin. The network facilitates the creation and scaling of student clubs dedicated to Bitcoin, offering support and financial assistance to affiliated clubs. \"The word 'network' is mentioned 21 times in the bitcoin whitepaper,\" said Ella Hough, Co-founder and Project Lead at Generation Bitcoin. \"Satoshi was too purposeful for this amount to be a coincidence. We founded the Bitcoin Students Network to empower students with knowledge and networking opportunities and encourage them to join the conversation that needs them in it. BSN aims to remove barriers to creating student Bitcoiner communities and strengthen Bitcoin’s Layer 0, the social/human layer.\" BSN aims to act as a bridge between students and the broader Bitcoin industry, facilitating communication and collaboration between educational institutions and industry players. By providing access to resources, job opportunities, and mentorship, BSN aims to strengthen the social fabric of Bitcoin's human layer, known as Layer 0. The network operates on core values such as freedom through knowledge, open-source principles, proof of work, and first principles thinking. These values underpin BSN's distributed yet organized structure, with a founding team, industry board of advisors, and student board of advisors guiding its operations. For students, BSN offers a plethora of opportunities, including starting or growing university Bitcoin clubs, accessing educational and job opportunities, and connecting with like-minded individuals in the Bitcoin community. \"A key part of my journey has been educating the next generation about Bitcoin,\" stated Generation Bitcoin Growth Lead and Co-founder Arsh Molu. \"The Bitcoin Students Network aims to provide support for university clubs as well as equip students with resources, knowledge, and job opportunities worldwide.\" Industry players are also encouraged to participate by organizing events, providing financial support, donating resources, offering mentorship, and sharing internship and job opportunities.",

  "article_title": "Will Bitcoin Transform into Just Another Stock Amidst Institutional Surge and ETF Integration?  ",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Maria Carola"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Steering through a sea of change in the crypto market, the investment game is experiencing a seismic shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist, signaling Bitcoin's leap into mainstream finance and knitting it closer to conventional investment fabrics. We'll look at the tip of the iceberg trying to imagine its true depth as well as the current correlation between Bitcoin, stocks, and Gold. We’ll attempt to figure out if the traditional market is really leading Bitcoin out of its decentralized place, or if there's still an avenue for hope that it can maintain its unique path. According to the Kaiko data, Bitcoin's risk-adjusted returns were superior to traditional assets. Nvidia led with the highest returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while Bitcoin impressively trailed just behind, outpacing major traditional assets like the S&P 500, Gold, with its value surging over 160% in risk-adjusted terms. Source: Kaiko Research Meanwhile, according to the IMF Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy study, 80% of variation in crypto prices and its increasing correlation with equity markets coincided with the entry of institutional investors into crypto markets since 2020. In particular, trading volumes by institutions on crypto exchanges grew by more than 1,700% (from roughly $25 billion to more than $450 billion) during the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. According to the study, the US monetary policy affects the crypto cycle, just like global equity cycles, but surprisingly, only the US Fed's monetary policy matters, not the other major central banks – probably because crypto markets are highly USD-dependent. Furthermore, the 2023 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Outlook Survey indicates that 64% of investors are set to up their stakes in the crypto sphere within three years, allocating up to 5% of AUM to crypto. It said a number of institutions made investments for the first time over the past year, while others increased their existing investments. While the study highlights a surge in crypto commitment from 41% of asset managers, only 27% of asset owners seem to be ramping up their stakes. Although Bitcoin was born from the idea of spreading power equally, recent studies indicate that it's slowly becoming dominated by a select few big players. Changing Correlation Dynamics Interestingly, Bitcoin moves in sync with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with an impressive correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has sharply decreased recently, contrasting with claims that investors see crypto as a safe haven or hedge against inflation, a role traditionally played by Gold. Source: TheBlock Notably, Bitcoin's correlation with Gold was positive at 0.83 on November 7, 2023, but decreased to -0.1 on January 10, 2024, before rebounding to a marginally higher positive level 0.14 on February 9, 2024. In the meantime, Bitcoin's relationship with the S&P 500 saw a negative correlation of -0.76 on November 11, 2023, and then hit a positive correlation of 0.57 in January 2024. Ths shift from negative to positive correlation points to Bitcoin's changing perception among investors. The Nasdaq Composite, known for its technology and growth stocks, also displayed a variable correlation with Bitcoin. The negative correlation, of -0.69 on October 30, 2023, shifted to positive 0.44 in January. It seems traders are linking Bitcoin's rhythm to the tech sector's pulse, hinting at a new kinship in investment strategies. When the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equity markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increases, while its correlation with Gold decreases, it suggests that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset rather than a safe haven. When investors are feeling venturous, they often swing toward stocks and digital coins for the chance at juicier profits. If institutional and retail investors are increasingly involved in both equity and cryptocurrency markets, their simultaneous buy and sell decisions could cause the price movements of these assets to align. Spot Bitcoin ETFs getting the green light seem to be ramping up its charm for big-time investors, with a solid chunk already planning to boost their Bitcoin game. Bitcoin's move into ETFs might make it act more like stocks since those funds are big players in the stock world. Amidst these developments, the essence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, free from the confines of traditional financial systems, could be undermined. Moreover, these shifts could expose Bitcoin to the very systemic risks from which it was designed to escape. Closing Thoughts As we look at how spot Bitcoin ETFs might shake up Bitcoin's role in the market and its current tie to stocks, we need to keep a sharp eye on balancing our excitement for more big players jumping in and the possible growth with staying true to Bitcoin's core principle of not being centrally controlled. Bitcoin's move toward a more centralized investment scene could stir the market, offering bright opportunities, but also tough challenges ahead. This is a guest post by Maria Carola.

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {

  "article_detailed_content": "The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. The United States federal government has once again added to its substantial Bitcoin hoard, transferring $922 million worth from wallets associated with Bitfinex hackers in a seizure. Over the course of a series of various seizures and other asset forfeitures, the United States federal government has accumulated and holds enough Bitcoin to unquestionably count as one of the largest whales. In the earliest days of the Bitcoin scene, the overwhelming crypto-anarchist spirit among the community led to a series of various extralegal business ventures, most famously the Silk Road. This overtly illegalist era of the industry is more or less completely over, but the success of these early ventures accumulated massive amounts of Bitcoin: which has in time been accumulated by the US government. The Silk Road alone has been at the center of several massive seizures from law enforcement agencies, with the site’s actual coffers far from the only source. On multiple occasions over the last few years, various hackers who robbed the Silk Road have in turn seen their assets seized and added to the federal government’s massive stockpile. Even though hundreds of millions of bitcoins from this source have already been sold at government auctions or through other means, there are still billions left to go. For their part, law enforcement agencies seem to be in no hurry to wash their hands of these assets. Source On February 29, the stockpile grew once again when the government moved more than 15k bitcoins from the wallets of two Bitfinex hackers. The hackers, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, recently testified about their 2016 hack of Bitfinex, which ranks as one of the most profitable heists of all time with nearly 120k bitcoins stolen. Bitfinex, one of the oldest still-operating exchanges in the entire crypto ecosystem, is still a prominent service, but their operations still bear lingering scars from a theft of this magnitude. For one thing, US citizens are completely forbidden from accessing the platform, along with citizens from several other countries. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Justice Department has refused to state whether or not the government intends to reimburse Bitfinex’s 2016 customers, who actually had their money stolen. Regardless of what the government’s plans are with this money, a seizure like this has once again highlighted the sheer size of the federal government’s Bitcoin reserve. Thankfully, the government’s dealings with these assets are all a matter of public record, and Bitcoin transactions themselves are all completely transparent on the blockchain. For this reason, analysts are confident in the claim that the United States holds just shy of 200k bitcoins, worth approximately $12.1 billion. This makes them unmistakably one of the largest whales out there, with only Binance and Satoshi holding greater amounts. In fact, the government currently holds nearly 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Regardless of claims that prosecutors have no interest in maximizing profits when disposing of these assets, it’s undeniable that the government holds substantial leverage over the whole space. These seizures are particularly interesting due to some recent comments made by exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden. Specifically, considering the rising global acceptance of Bitcoin in regulation and traditional finance, Snowden predicted that “A national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin—the modern replacement for monetary gold—without having disclosed that fact publicly”. If Bitcoin is the digital gold, after all, it would only make sense that powerful nations would want to build up reserves. The strategy has famously worked for the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, who greeted the new bull market with a declaration that his country’s Bitcoin investment has gone up by 40% since the initial purchases. Not, of course, that he plans to sell. In any event, Snowden’s comments seem especially relevant in that the United States hasn’t actually purchased any of the Bitcoin it currently holds. Even though the government has a theoretical responsibility to dispose of these assets, the pace as of yet has been glacial, and in the meantime, it would be extremely straightforward for Congress to halt these sales. All it would take is a desire for the policy to change, and a genuine Bitcoin reserve could spring up overnight. This is the crux of Snowden’s specific prediction that governments will acquire Bitcoin secretly and that the government has ample plausible deniability. We don’t have a reserve; we just happen to be reserving these assets for a later sale. There is nothing suspicious about that! If a government did actually want to acquire massive quantities of Bitcoin in secret, it would run into a great number of transparency problems caused by the trustless nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain. The anonymous “Mr. 100” has made headlines throughout the month of February, acquiring a mind boggling 100 BTC per day and reaching the status of the 15th largest whale. As chain analysts have tried to determine the buyer’s identity, speculation has already begun that a national government is the culprit. Based on the timing of the purchases and several other factors, the buyer is likely in Asia, specifically the Middle East. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia—all these are strong candidates to be the coins’ rightful owners. In other words, if a government wishes to build up a Bitcoin reserve, it might be easier to seize the assets outright rather than buy them at fair value. After all, if the transactions will be recorded on the blockchain either way, why not save their money? The UK seems well-positioned to build up a stockpile in this way like the Americans, having seized $1.77 billion in January. Not only were these bitcoins seized from a foreign national currently on the run, with no recourse to recoup these funds, but the British government has subsequently passed legislation deepening its power to seize or freeze cryptocurrency assets. It wouldn’t take much to start building up a notable hoard in its own right. By this point, the days when Bitcoin’s core community held a defiant attitude towards law enforcement are a distant memory. Although people can commit crimes centered around Bitcoin just like they can with any other currency, the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is only becoming more legitimate for the world’s governments. US regulators approved a Bitcoin ETF, and other countries are falling like dominoes to endorse it themselves. Eventually, it’ll be a necessity for powerful governments to stay on par with their competitors and maintain their own reserves of Bitcoin. The US, after all, controls nearly 1% of a massive industry with substantial leverage over it. Are they going to be the only country with this leverage? It may be difficult for any nation to build up these stockpiles in secret, but even so, the race has already begun. No matter who wins it, it’s Bitcoin that will be on top in the end.",

  "article_detailed_content": "The final agreement between the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot Platforms, Inc., and the Energy Information Administration has just dropped, and it’s a good one. In sum, the EIA will voluntarily terminate the illegal EIA-862 collection action they initiated, and they will commit to destroying all the information that they have received and may still receive under the EIA-862. Furthermore, they will also cancel and withdraw the February 9th, 2024 notice for collection, replacing it with a new Notice. This new notice will run for a full 60 days from the date it is released in the Federal Register, and the EIA also has consented to ensure that any comments which have been received on the Feb. 9th notice will be incorporated and considered in the new notice. So here’s the takeaway: the Government has to go back to the well and do it right. They can’t use a pretextual political “emergency” to ram this through, and fortunately the Mining industry, through the quick and decisive work of the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot, blocked that clear violation. But the flight is not over, we have to file our comments on the new data collection notice as soon as it’s released. And you can see that the fight is going to be harder, as groups antagonistic to bitcoin mining are already jumping into the fray. The Sierra Club attempted to file an amicus brief in this case. That brief, which did make it on the record (though it was opposed as improper and it’s moot now anyway), shows their arguments that they will likely elaborate on in a filing supporting the EIA’s new data collection. Those arguments are as weak as you might expect, but they will be out there and will need to be addressed and overcome. Finally, as a lovely cherry on top, the Government will also reimburse the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot Platforms, Inc., for $2,199.45 of court costs and attorney’s fees. Clearly not enough to cover the expense, but still a sweet surprise. But let’s be clear, nothing in this agreement is “an admission of liability or wrongdoing… .” Sure, and “[s]omething is rotten in the state of Denmark,” which can be smelt all the way in Waco, Texas.

  "article_title": "Instant Settlement Series: It's Not About The Money",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Ivan Makedonski"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Instant settlement profoundly transforms our behavior as it reconnects us with the elemental laws of nature. The existing paradigm mirrors the primal imperative of reaping benefits in exchange for labor–working to survive, but the pay-per-time system in the labor market is creating the incentive to get something for nothing. In the whole “fiat stack,” everyone optimizes their efforts to achieve this on different levels, as I explain below. How can I get money for nothing? As we explore the effects of instant settlement across diverse industries, a fundamental divide between workers and clockwatchers emerges, as I have argued throughout this series. Fiat payments work without instant settlement; instead, a virtual credit arrives immediately with the actual settlement usually coming much later. The Lightning Network enables instant settlement. That is a key advantage, and it’s why Bitcoin is the only financial network that has the potential to achieve the vision that I am describing in this series. The fiat monetary system is training us to play the game of rent-seeking without realizing it, and it is no wonder that the best players become the richest. From our first jobs, we learn how to extract maximum payment for minimum effort, and the incentives reward creative ways of doing just that. The first trick everyone learns is how to “milk the clock” by doing as little as possible without getting fired. A slightly more advanced technique is learning how to take credit for others’ work. Skilled players seek promotions in order to gain access to others’ labor for their own benefit. This is the fiat game. As if that weren’t bad enough, the rent-seeking game also corrodes skills. Just as my results in the gym are correlated with the effort I invest into my workout, employees’ mastery comes from effort. But time-based compensation rewards passing time rather than performance, allowing skills to atrophy. In technologically primitive societies, skill development was imperative for survival. The problem was friction: assessing the value for each miniscule action and compensating each one individually. So the obvious way to reduce friction was to collapse all the tasks into a single variable — time. But after decades of time-based compensation and diminishing initiative, we are becoming lethargic, weak, skill-deficient, and reliant on free money. The result is a culture of dependency, where the quest for easy money overshadows the pursuit of self-improvement. How many steps are we from enslaving our own children to avoid working? Perhaps the key to overcoming this fate is deciding not to chase the fucking money, but to pursue other goals instead and just using the money to achieve them. Make a list of what you want in life and start working towards it. Instead of working for wages, saving money, and buying a house, you can build your own house. Yes, it will take years, but that is the point. Do the work! If you object that you can’t build a house, you’re probably right. You can’t do anything until you can. It’s simply a matter of placing one brick on top of another, a roof on top of the walls, and so on. Work transforms us, makes us better, faster, stronger, and more skillful versions of our former selves. Bitcoin preserves the value of your energy, allowing you to achieve your goals faster than is possible with fiat. When you are working for others’ goals, you should be compensated instantly, which is almost like double compensation. You get skills and money. In the fiat system, when you get free money (money for time passed), you do not acquire any skills, and the skills you have start to atrophy because you are not using them. The only incentive that pushes people to do something is the fear of getting fired. That is why they seek to find the balance right between minimal work and not getting fired. But there remains an undeniable obstacle: why should I work for my money rather than simply waiting and receiving it without exertion? The status quo is comfortable, but comfort is the enemy. Defeating this enemy requires a collective willingness to break free from the allure of effortless gains and embracing a more natural, purposeful way of working. Those who shun time-based compensation will have the advantage of attracting and retaining the most exceptional individuals as employees. As these forward-thinkers continually evolve–growing faster, stronger, and more skillful over time–their products and services will outshine pay-per-time systems. In the new market landscape I have described throughout this series, employees who are paid for their work rather than their time are no longer tethered to a single company. The quality of products and services is propelled by the collective efforts of the contributors rather than malingering clock milkers supervised and pushed by management. Labor exploitation becomes untenable, and pay-for-work is what retains the best talent. This is true simply because the best want to be paid based on results, and the only fair compensation to both the employee and employer is pay-per-work, which is based on those results. This newfound power may lead individuals to focus on the things they want to see built rather than what the company tells them to build. They gain not only a decentralized income but can also benefit the most from the tasks they complete. If there is an open project to fix ten roads, I will contribute to fixing the one that I use most. It is the most selfish altruistic thing. That benefit is not private; it is shared. The money I receive is private. As long as we chase money rather than projects, it is no surprise we are indifferent towards other people's problems. In this new paradigm, the balance of power shifts decisively to the people, aligning with their preferences and aspirations, not the agenda of a single company. Additionally, the pay-for-work system mirrors the competitive nature of sports–individuals are compensated for their time and effort, but victory is contingent on active participation and skill. In sports, the best players distinguish themselves with their superior skills, the effort they invest, and their adaptability in the face of competition. This natural dynamic, favoring the fastest, strongest, and most adaptable, can now enrich the labor market. Survival and prosperity will hinge not only on individual effort but on the ability to outperform others in the pursuit of a larger share of benefits. Even those merely chasing money prosper by simply mirroring Bitcoin. If I do something selfishly in Bitcoin, the whole network benefits. In the world of sports, fame and wealth often follow the best players, but their initial motivation lies in the desire to be the best. Encouragement in the pay-for-work labor market takes the form of payment, catalyzing continued dedication and progress. The accumulation of these payments, akin to encouragement, propels people to refine their skills, enhance their performance, and, in turn, receive more Bitcoin in acknowledgment of their efforts. The reward in this system is not acclaim or praise; it starts as a necessity for money and progresses to satisfaction derived from the work. Instant settlement becomes the Trojan horse guiding us back to this ethos. In this continuous competition, unlike the win-lose dynamics of warfare, everyone stands to gain. Individuals work for themselves, driven by the desire to achieve their own goals, while the finished product simultaneously serves a common need because a lot of them are collective goods. The swifter, more efficient, and cost-effective completion of tasks that benefit the community will induce a snowball effect where subsequent benefits build on previous ones. In this interconnected web, where everyone coordinates efficiently, there is no theft or exploitation; rather, it is a shared journey toward collective betterment. With pay-for-time, people seek to climb the hierarchy and obtain the privilege of delegating, which lets them shift accountability and find scapegoats. In stark contrast, the pay-for-work built on instant-settlement systems operates like the immutable and uncompromising laws of physics. Every individual bears complete responsibility for their work. This paradigm gauges individuals not by their inclination to assign blame or dwell on problems, but by their responsibility and their commitment to accomplishing the job at hand. The best performance yields the most money, so pay-for-work puts the job first, unlike pay-for-time, where more money results from more time passed, and the job is almost irrelevant. In the pay-for-work system, responsibility becomes a measure of personal and professional integrity, fostering a culture where the focus is on getting the work done efficiently and collaboratively. Roy Sheinfeld, Breez CEO and my boss, has said that we should not tell people what experiences to create in their apps. I agree. The point of the previous chapters was to spark interest in the possibilities so the experts can create those experiences. I am not the right person to say how construction, logistics, book publishing, and other industries should evolve. I am trying to open the window for them to realize the potential they can create and build for all of us. If they do this we all win. They receive Bitcoin, and in turn, we spend Bitcoin more efficiently on things that enrich our lives. This collaborative venture is an invitation to explore, innovate, and contribute to a shared future where everyone stands to gain. Here’s a quick recap with the take-home messages from the previous articles in this series: The first article: The Construction Industry What is work? The conflict between people who are asked to work but benefit from passing time without working. How reputation depends on the work done, not someone’s job title. Second article: The Logistics Industry How delaying payments creates counterparty risk. How intermediaries (banks) compound that risk. How split payments align everyone’s incentives to deliver on a project. Decentralization fostering competition. Third article: The Publishing Industry The dematerialized economy is now on steroids The benefit of any work is determined more by demand for it than supply of it Talking and selling are not the same, so commissions are the best way to compensate influencers Forth article: Real-time Streaming Payments Benefiting from work can be a continuous process with streaming payments. Global benefits deserve global compensation. Auctioning seats to events can transform live entertainment. Fifth article: The Gambling Industry Fiat is gambling. Licenses and credentials disadvantage the poor and reinforce the power of the rich. How to invest wisely. A transitional period is crucial. If a business were to suddenly shift to a performance-based pay model without considering the existing workforce, it could lead to unrest and prompt employees to leave for a pay-per-time company. Those who recognize the need for change should adopt a long-term perspective and implement both payment methods – pay-per-time and instant settlement – simultaneously. The objective is to have these methods coexist, attracting top performers and fostering a culture of excellence. Once the company establishes a foundation of high-performing individuals, it can then phase out the pay-per-time structure entirely. I draw inspiration for this approach from my mentor from a distance, Jeff Booth, as these two systems represent distinct paradigms, necessitating a careful and strategic transition rather than an abrupt shift. These are my final messages: Build utility, do not promise future fortunes. Do not wait or ask permission to do work. Do the work that you want to do. Let's Fucking GO!

  "article_title": "BITPACS: Emulating DAOs on Bitcoin",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Dillon Healy"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "I wanted to share some thoughts on a seemingly overlooked innovation that has come to Bitcoin within the last year, called Bitpacs. Bitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. DAO’s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit the “decentralization” of their chain, so will not be as decentralized as the same experience built on Bitcoin. DAO’s are also not autonomous, as humans control and shape the decisions they make. The Bitpac definition is a more honest explanation of the tech involved and I think eventually will be a better experience for users. Why should bitcoiners even care about DAO’s? As of Feb 18th 2024, DAO’s on Ethereum hold over $35 billion in treasury funds. There have been millions of DAO proposal makers and voters, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been transacted via DAO governance. (source) There is clear demand for on-chain governance and community management, Bitpacs allow this to come to Bitcoin. How can Bitpacs actually work? While Bitpacs don't directly utilize smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, they achieve similar functionality as DAOs through a combination of multisig wallets and carefully crafted Bitcoin transactions. The structures possible with this encompass most of what a DAO does: Multisig ensures that no one is ever in unilateral control of any Bitpac funds, requiring the quorum threshold to spend anything. Signing thresholds that mandate how many signatures are needed to finalize a transaction (3 of 5 or 6 of 10 for example) can fine tune required voting thresholds in line with the defined Bitpac consensus requirements. Time constraints can be applied to voting rounds, ending the signing process for proposals that haven’t achieved a signing threshold by the end of a voting period. Gating membership of Bitpacs based on certain criteria can be done at the platform level, like unique assets held, bitcoin contributed to the treasury, or known wallet addresses, all of which can be verified on-chain. All of these dynamics that cannot be enforced through Bitcoin script or pre-signed transactions, and must resort to social enforcement, are transparently verifiable on-chain guaranteeing detection of Bitpac rule violations. What do Bitpacs enable on Bitcoin? Bitpacs unlock exciting possibilities for bitcoin users: Community-driven funding: Fundraising for public goods, projects, or charitable causes becomes more efficient and secure with Bitpacs. Contributors can trust that funds are used as intended, thanks to the transparent nature of the multisig. Decentralized governance: Bitpacs empower communities to make collective decisions regarding fund allocation and spending. Voting rights are distributed among key holders, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process. Increased trust and collaboration: By eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional financial systems, Bitpacs build trust and foster collaboration between individuals with shared interests, and doing so fully on-chain. Some specific examples of Bitpac use cases include: Funding open-source development: Developers can create Bitpacs to receive community funding for their projects, with transparent spending records ensuring accountability to their backers. Managing community treasuries: Any organization can leverage Bitpacs for transparent management of their funds, allowing members to track spending, create proposals, and participate in decision-making. Crowdfunding: Bitpacs can be used as a means to crowdfund bitcoin from a group of supporters for a pre-established shared goal, company, investment fund, or project. A major lesson for the industry over the last year has been how much innovation and experimentation can still be done on native Bitcoin without requiring any changes to the network. We have seen massive interest around BitVM, Ordinals, roll-ups, sidechains, layers, metaprotocols, all within bitcoins current consensus. There is clearly a cambrian explosion of developer and user interest coming to Bitcoin which will not slow down any time soon. Tens of thousands of new niche communities will be popping up on Bitcoin in the coming years. This doesn’t include traditional companies that continue to trend towards Bitcoin adoption over time. Bitpacs can agnostically offer community organization, treasury management, and on-chain governance to all of them. The thousands of ideas being “built on Bitcoin” should have one thing in common, eventual settlement on the base layer. Different methods of governance will be experimented with over time, but this is why Bitpacs could be the superior model. Bitpac members have direct voting access to the treasury and transactions occur at the base layer; there is no side-chain, layer, or additional protocol that Bitpac members need to trust. Potentially this cycle, people will start to realize that Bitcoin block space is just as scarce as bitcoin the asset. As we trend further towards a hyperbitcoinized world, with nation states and institutions transacting, I think that Bitpacs representing large community or entity treasuries will be one of the few things that will justify occurring at the Base layer. – Anybody can create Bitpacs on their own. @Tribe_btc is a centralized project I’m working on aiming to create a full tooling suite for Bitpacs. Tribe will be releasing our Bitpac documentation soon. By Dillon Healy BD / Partnerships BTC Inc. @dillonhealybtc",

  "article_title": "Anduro: A Network of Sidechains",
  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Shinobi"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Marathon yesterday announced their Anduro layer two proposal. While there aren't really any fundamentally new pieces or developments in the Anduro design, they do compose in slightly different ways compared to other existing sidechain systems such as RSK or Liquid/Elements. Anduro is a federated model that makes use of a quorum, referred to as the “Collective” in the released documents. The main distinction between Anduro and other sidechain proposals is the explicit design based around the Collective operating and being capable of spinning up and managing multiple sidechains with different architectures. This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one. Anduro is also going to be merge mined, which like RSK (also using a federated peg), does not offer any type of added security for the bitcoin pegged into the sidechain held by the federation. It does however, also like RSK, provide POW security to other assets that might be issued on the sidechain not pegged in from the mainchain and custodied by the federation. Peg And Consensus Model The actual peg between the mainchain and the sidechain is fundamentally the same thing as Liquid, and in detail looks to be roughly identical in terms of structure and implementation. The Collective will be launched with 15 members as Functionaries, the entities actually handling the multisig keys involved with managing the peg, and 50 or more Contributors, which seem to be similar to Liquid partial members that can whitelist and initiate withdrawals from the sidechain(s) even though they are not active participants in processing those withdrawals. Also like Liquid, Anduro will also use a formal organization to handle matters of governance. I.e. handling upgrades to the network, deciding on future changes to the membership set of the federation, and in general any issues that will come up in regards to the operation of the sidechains the Collective is operating. The federation’s security ultimately relies on jurisdictional diversity in order to maintain any type of censorship resistance or safety from fund confiscation even though a federation is composed of honest members. The interesting part of the design here, is unlike RSK, the Collective plays an active role in the consensus process beyond facilitating the operations of the peg mechanism. In Anduro, the Collective actually comes to consensus on the block contents for the sidechain through a Byztanine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm or round robin selection where a single member constructs the blocks for that round. They also periodically sign blocks to function as a checkpointing system to prevent reordering of anything in the historical past. Once signed and checkpointed, miners are incapable of reorging any sidechain blocks without the assistance of the Collective. Both of these factors essentially function as a firewall between Miner Extractable Value opportunities and the miners. MEV is any opportunity available to miners where reordering transactions, such as front running orders on a decentralized exchange, can present an opportunity for that miner to earn extra revenue when they mine their next block. MEV has shown a tendency to increase centralization pressures for block producers in other networks it has become prevalent in. Because of the fact that the Collective is actually deciding the contents of sidechain blocks, and miners are simply committing to them with proof of work, the Collective acts as a shield against those centralizing pressures for block producers (in Bitcoin’s case miners) by taking on the role of actual block construction. Long term Marathon states they intend to work towards trustless peg mechanisms and consensus mechanisms, specifically citing BitVM as an example of how this could be achievable. While this draws into question the ability to maintain the MEV protections the current architecture has in such a transition, it currently prevents MEV from presenting a risk of centralization pressures for miners. It’s also important to note that BitVM ultimately as designed with a prover-verifier model inherently requires defined participants to manage any funds locked in a BitVM peg. While it does radically improve the security model of the peg by allowing provable penalization of dishonest participants by a single member, massive changes to BitVM’s design itself would be necessary to completely remove the need for the equivalent of a federation. Overall the architecture strikes a nice balance of implementing a variant of existing sidechain designs, while in its current iteration intentionally creating a sort of protective layers between the sidechains and miners when it comes to the risks of MEV. The First Two On launch Anduro will have support for two sidechain architectures, one based on Bitcoin, the other on Ethereum. Coordinate: Coordinate is the Bitcoin sidechain variant. It will implement small changes to Bitcoin, including native support for asset issuance similar to Liquid, and is intending to cater towards Ordinals and token use cases such as BRC-20, and the primitive DeFi products and services that have built up around them. Alys: Alys is the Ethereum sidechain variant, essentially just porting the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity to a Bitcoin sidechain. The hope is that it can provide a new learning curve environment for Ethereum application developers to shift their focus towards building services and tools on top of Bitcoin.",

  "article_detailed_content": "BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is poised to make its debut in Brazil tomorrow, according to a report from the largest financial market news platform in Brazil, InfoMoney. The launch follows the announcement by BlackRock that the Brazilian Depositary Receipts (BDRs) of its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) will begin trading on B3, Brazil's stock exchange, on Friday, according to the report. “Our digital asset journey has been underpinned by the goal of providing high-quality access vehicles to investors,” said Karina Saade, president of BlackRock in Brazil. “IBIT39 is a natural progression of our efforts over many years and builds on the fundamental capabilities we have established so far in the digital asset market.” IBIT39 will initially be available to qualified investors, with retail access expected to follow in the coming \"weeks.\" The management fee for IBIT39 is set at 0.25%, with a one-year waiver and a reduction to 0.12% after reaching $5 billion in assets under management. In the United States, where Bitcoin spot ETFs were cleared by regulators in January, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has emerged as the most popular option, accumulating over $9 billion in assets since launch. According to Bloomberg data, BlackRock's ETF attracted a record $612 million of inflows in a single day yesterday. Despite the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Saade emphasized that BlackRock's launch in Brazil and the United States does not constitute an endorsement of Bitcoin itself but rather a recognition of its relevance as an asset class. “Our goal is to serve our customers with safe and transparent products. We have no recommendation or any expectations regarding Bitcoin itself,” Saade explained.",

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Colin Crossman"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Yesterday we were supposed to have a hearing on the preliminary injunction in the Texas Blockchain Council v. Department of Energy case. But, as often happens in litigation, things change quickly. Tuesday the judge entered an order canceling today's hearing based on the parties reaching an \"agreement-in-principle\" on the overall dispute. This agreement must be finalized and filed by Friday, March 1st. Speculation time. What could this mean? One element of the standard for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and a preliminary injunction, is that the party requesting it has to show that they are \"likely to succeed on the merits.\" This means that the judge has to believe that, not only is success possible, but more likely than not. Here, the judge already agreed that \"that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the facts alleged by Defendants to support an emergency request fall far short of justifying such an action.\" And that the Government's action was arbitrary, capricious, or abused their discretion. Losing the TRO, while not dispositive, is a big red flag. The Government does not like to lose, and once it has lost on this metric, it's very likely that they already know they will lose on the following motions: the preliminary injunction and the permanent injunction. One problem there is discovery. As part of the process of proving the case, the Plaintiffs get to request internal communications and other materials that might show an abuse of discretion or undue influence. The Energy Information Administration has only used emergency data collection authority in a handful of actual emergencies, such as an emergency survey in response to the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack. Given the context of Senator Warren and the Biden Administration's continued attacks on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, is there any reason to believe that there aren't unflattering emails or communications showing undue influence between those offices and the EIA? What else could have caused a historically cautious and respected agency to suddenly put out such slipshod work as the EIA-862, which was then rubber stamped by the President's own Office of Management and Budget in clear technical violation of their internal standards? It is not like this kind of undue influence hasn't happened before... look at Custodia Bank's lawsuit, for instance, where \"perhaps the most stunning fact that would never have seen the light of day but for discovery is this: in the wake of FTX’s collapse and a mysterious briefing to Vice-Chair Barr concerning Custodia’s membership and master account applications, Board staff edited and rewrote key parts of an internal Kansas City Fed memo … Discovery reveals that the Board was deeply intertwined in the outcome of Custodia’s master account request. That level of involvement is not consistent with the notion of unfettered Reserve Bank discretion.\" Page 54 of Custodia's December 22, 2023 Brief for Judgment as a Matter of Law. While we await more information, it seems clear that any voluntary concession by the Government here reveals some combination of realization that they exhibited either manifest incompetence, or that discovery would bear out significant undue influence on the process.

Snowden's prediction comes amid increasing institutional, retail, and nation state interest in Bitcoin, with several major corporations and investment firms allocating significant resources to the asset. While Snowden did not specify which government he believes will make the purchase, the prospect of a second national government acquiring Bitcoin and making it legal tender, like El Salvador did in 2021, would represent another huge milestone for Bitcoin. Earlier today, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele commented on Bitcoin's recent price increase, stating \"When Bitcoin’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses. Now that Bitcoin’s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program. We won’t sell, or course; at the end 1 BTC = 1 BTC (this was true when the market price was low and it’s true now); but it’s very telling that the authors of those hit pieces, the “analysts”, the “experts”, the “journalists”, are totally silent now.\" El Salvador's bet on Bitcoin has appeared to pay off, not just from the perspective of their BTC investments increasing in value, but also from attracting large amounts of tourism from Bitcoiners and investment in the country. Other countries may be taking notice of what Bitcoin has done for El Salvador, and may want the same. As Snowden's prediction garners attention, it underscores the growing mainstream recognition of Bitcoin's role in the global economy and its potential to reshape traditional financial systems.",

The team is working to remediate. — Brian Armstrong 🛡️ (@brian_armstrong) February 28, 2024 Following the outage, Bitcoin sharply declined in price from ~$64,000 to ~$59,500, wiping out most of the gains Bitcoin had made today. Coinbase has experienced similar outages in the past during periods of intense market volatility, prompting criticism from users and industry observers.

  "article_detailed_content": "“Government agents are not active in Bitcoin developer and influencer circles.” - Government Agents, probably As the war for global monetary supremacy wages on, you have to assume that the state is actively operating information warfare. This means that the state is operating and acting in order to preserve and expand it’s own power. For that reason, it is sane and reasonable to assume that state operators are in the trenches of Bitcoin attempting to influence public perception, developer activity, and overall bitcoin adoption. If you think this is not happening then you are naive or you’re incentivized to act against bitcoin in a different way. The sabotage of Bitcoin is not some tin foil hat conspiracy, the sabotage of Bitcoin is actively playing out in real time, but the big question is where the sabotage is taking place and what can you do to identify and act to counter the sabotage? So let’s zoom into Bitcoin of today, where conversation is happening around the future of Bitcoin in regards to dealing with Ordinals, or spam (if you are part of that camp)1. The rise of Ordinals last year and the pressure they have caused on blockspace demand has surfaced new rivalries within the bitcoin maximalist community as memetic warfare is waged on what bitcoin is and how it should be used. The purpose of this article is not to make a political stand in this fight, but to point out places in Bitcoin that are prone to sabotage and where active sabotage campaigns might be actively waged. Seeing this division in a once undivided front is enough to make one pause and consider what external forces are at work. Bitcoin’s Power Balance As we consider the infighting happening within Bitcoin, it is important to understand the different parties within bitcoin and how each of the powers balance each other out. In 2019, Nic Carter illustrated Bitcoin’s Power Balance Model. This model shows the key roles in Bitcoin and the relationship between each one. You can see the circular feedback loop between Miners -> Devs -> Economic Nodes. In a vacuum these three roles would perpetually pump each other with nothing to keep them in check. At the heart of the model are the Users who keep Devs and Economic nodes in check. Bitcoin’s Power Balance Model by Nic Carter source. The one factor in the power model that touches each of the player in the model is the software of code. The software touches each of the roles in one way or another and this is probably the largest threat vector to all of Bitcoin. The simple activity of running code is how Bitcoin is eating the monetary world, so it is probably worth understanding the development process. Bitcoin Development Process Let’s now dig into the Bitcoin development process. As you know, making changes to Bitcoin is a slow and deliberate process. This is a big change from the “move fast and break things” mentality of Silicon Valley. Many argue that this slow methodical process is actually one of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths. In 2011, Gwern published “Bitcoin Is Worse Is Better” where he says “However, in an example of ‘Worse is Better’, the ugly inefficient prototype of Bitcoin successfully created a secure decentralized digital currency, which can wait indefinitely for success, and this was enough to eventually lead to adoption, improvement, and growth into a secure global digital currency.” This ugly inefficient code has gotten us here today, 15 years later, and in that time the slow methodical approach to Bitcoin development has been and will probably continue to be a part of the developer ethos. The development process has even been formally documented in BIP 2 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Here are the general steps in the BIP activation process: Drafting the BIP: The first step is to draft a BIP following the template outlined in BIP2. This includes writing a detailed document or white paper that outlines the proposed changes. The BIP should be comprehensive, covering motivation, technical specifications, and rationale. Discussion and Feedback: Once the BIP is drafted, it’s shared with the Bitcoin community for discussion and feedback and usually happens on platforms like the Bitcoin Dev mailing list, GitHub, and even Twitter. The purpose is to solicit feedback, refine the proposal, and begin to build consensus around it. Assigning a BIP Number: If the BIP is deemed to have potential and is unique, it’s assigned a BIP number by a BIP editor. This is a formal acknowledgment that the BIP is under consideration. Formal Review: After the BIP is assigned a number, it enters a formal review phase. During this time, the BIP is scrutinized for technical soundness, feasibility, and compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol. This is where the devs try to break the bip and poke holes in the proposal. Revisions: Based on feedback and review, the BIP may undergo several revisions. Implementation: Once consensus is reached, the BIP is implemented in the Bitcoin Core codebase. This step involves actual coding and rigorous testing to ensure that the changes work as intended without introducing new vulnerabilities. Reaching Consensus: For a BIP to move forward, it needs to reach consensus among the Bitcoin development community. This is often the most challenging part, as Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that a wide range of stakeholders (developers, miners, users, etc.) need to agree on the change. Deployment: After implementation & consensus, the new version of Bitcoin Core including the BIP is released. Depending on the nature of the BIP, it might require a majority of miners or nodes to upgrade to the new version for the changes to take full effect. Activation: Finally, once the required threshold of network participants has adopted the new version, the changes proposed in the BIP are activated on the Bitcoin network. Reading through this is incredibly helpful in understanding how change happens to Bitcoin. The problem I see is where are the single point of failures in this process and who the gatekeepers2 are for each step. Conversations happening in channels now are surfacing weak points or non documented parts of the development cycle. For example, Bitcoin Inquisition. This is the in space between steps 2 and 3. Bitcoin Inquisition Bitcoin Inquisition is a non-documented part of the Bitcoin development process. It was proposed by and administered by AJ Towns in 2022. Here is a very brief summary of why and what it is. “I think the weakest link in that [bitcoin development] loop is the first one: what if we did activate soft forks on the default signet prior to the code being merged into core? To that end, I’m proposing a fork of core that I’m calling “bitcoin-inquisition”, with the idea that it branches from stable releases of core and adds support for proposed changes to consensus (CTV, ANYPREVOUT, TLUV, OP_CAT, etc…) and potentially also relay policy (relay changes are often implied by consensus changes, but also potentially things like package relay).” – AJ Towns on Bitcoin Inquisition The reality is that the Bitcoin Inquisition is live and well. AJ runs a special separate fork of Bitcoin core and acts as the sole admin for testing BIP’s. This is not documented in BIP-2, but has just been accepted as process by core devs. This is a curious development of how tribal devs can make changes how they see fit, without documentation. The Bitcoin Sabotage At this point we’ve run through the roles in Bitcoin, the steps in the development process, and even identified a glaring hole in the development process. Let’s now dig into what is sabotage. Sabotage. (noun) /ˈsæb.ə.tɑːʒ/ Definition: The deliberate destruction, damage, or obstruction of something, typically for political or military advantage. Sabotage is often carried out covertly and with the intention of hindering operations, activities, or plans of an opponent or competitor. Verb Form: Sabotage (sabotaging, sabotaged) Usage in a Sentence: “The bridge collapse was found to be the result of sabotage by enemy agents.” For purpose of this article, let’s frame sabotage specifically in relation to Bitcoin Sabotage. Bitcoin Sabotage is the deliberate destruction of Bitcoin, or obstruction of Bitcoin development or adoption, for political advantage. This is the frame. This is what we are up against. With that in mind let’s now dig into how sabotage is waged. Conveniently our very own CIA is masters at sabotage and have been waging sabotage tactics in warfare for over a century. Simple Sabotage Field Manual In the 1940’s, the CIA shipped a field manual called Simple Sabotage Field Manual. The purpose of this was to distribute to operators a practical manual on how to conduct sabotage operations behind enemy lines. While this manual is 80 years old, it reveals some classical tactics in the art of sabotage. Click here to download your Spook handbook today! This “Simple Sabotage” is a unique look at how sly the military is when it comes to unconventional warfare. This manual was developed in the 1940’s and you have to wonder how many more hours and resources have gone into modernizing this same document and other classified operators manuals. For purpose of this article, we will examine the Specific Suggestions for Sabotage sections focused on Organizations and Conferences & Managers and Supervisors. Organizations and Conferences Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions. Make “speeches,” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length., Illustrate your points by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate patriotic” comments. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible – never less than five. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision. Advocate “caution.” Be unreasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on. Be worried about the propriety of any decision – raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated Hes within the jurisdiction of the group 01’whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon. When I read Section A. Organizations and Conferences, I can’t help but think that Bitcoin development is being sabotaged, but I am a naive outsider. I am also a noticer. If I was going to sabotage Bitcoin, this field manual could easily be deployed from within developer circles. If you were a state operator with developing skills, it is reasonable to believe you could begin participating in code review process and make in roads and start having authority in matters. Let’s outline sabotage tactics state operators could be executing: Miners – in the great blocksize wars, some large mining pools signaled with the Big Blockers. This was an attack on Bitcoin, but it demonstrates a specific action that Mining Pool operators could carry out in order to sabotage Bitcoin. While this DID NOT work in breaking Bitcoin, we learned that Users are at the heart of Bitcoin. A bigger problem could be if large pool operators were acting in coordination with other roles. Devs – this is perhaps the biggest vector for sabotage attack. As we see more value soaked up by Bitcoin, it will become a bigger target for state actors. That means we will have state operators submitting pull requests and participating in the development process. Based on the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, operators could easily carry out many of the tactics outlined above. We are already seeing very divisive positions from developers on how bitcoin should be, so you must wonder who is the operator. Users – since users give feedback to developers, you would assume that giving bad feedback could lead to developers building something that is not in bitcoins best interest. Or users could socially attack developers into doing certain things. Right now we are seeing meme warfare being waged within the maximalist community, and it can’t all be organic discourse. Users infighting can lead to maldevelopment. Also, what happens if a group of bad actors in the users and developers camps are aligned. Or what if users coordinate to influence certain developers? Economic Nodes – they choose what transactions make it to miners via the code they run. Users tell them what code to run because users spend money with them. Economic nodes could sabotage by supporting old code, or malicious sabotaged code. In wrapping up this piece, the complex dynamics between miners, devs, users, and economic nodes within Bitcoin creates a ripe battle ground for meme warfare and Bitcoin Sabotage. The Bitcoin development process is without flaws and as outlined in the CIA’s Simple Sabotage Field Manual, there are many simple to deploy tactics that could be used to sabotage Bitcoin. This should serve as a sobering reality that Bitcoin is under attack and you should act accordingly. The responsibility is on you, humble frog, to keep your head on a swivel. You must stay aware and call out bullshit. Whether it is combating gaslighting, carrying out ethical trolling, or reviewing code, all these actions count and help preserve our only realistic shot at a more free future. The survival and flourishing of Bitcoin depend not just on NGU and its technological robustness but equally on the collective vigilance the users. As we navigate these uncertain times, let us be guided commitment to cypherpunk ethos, critical thinking, and unwavering support for the core principles that underpin Bitcoin which is freedom. In doing this, we might have a chance at winning the game of Bitcoin Sabotage and defeating our enemy, the state.",

The milestone comes amid increasing interest in the Bitcoin market and growing adoption by institutional investors. JUST IN: $61,000 #Bitcoin 💥🚀 pic.twitter.com/gMLqQ7inTf — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 28, 2024 The latest rally in Bitcoin's price reflects ongoing bullish sentiment among investors, fueled by factors such as increasing institutional adoption via spot Bitcoin ETFs, inflationary concerns, and growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. This week in particular has been a record breaking week for the Bitcoin ETFs. Yesterday, BlackRock's ETF took in over $520 million in inflows, which Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted it was \"the biggest haul for a BTC ETF ever.\" BlackRock's ETF has done around $1.3 billion in trading volume on each of the last two days. Whoa.. $IBIT took in $520 million all by itself yest, biggest haul for a btc ETF ever and 2nd most of any ETF yesterday, only $IVV took in more cash.. it is now $8b in aum, top 5% among all ETFs. This means a good portion of that massive volume was new buying vs arb/algo. pic.twitter.com/tnq7SaN2di — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 28, 2024 Yesterday, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased 10,050 BTC currently worth $615 million. To put into context how much this is, the amount of new Bitcoin created by miners yesterday was only ~900 BTC. The ETFs appear to be buying up all the available BTC on the market, driving up the price. It is important to note that Bitcoin's fourth halving is approaching, where the mining reward for creating new bitcoin will be cut in half from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. Wow... (Data from Feb. 27.; h/t to @HODL15Capital) pic.twitter.com/KvttRhHyAm — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) February 28, 2024 Bitcoin has been on a steady upward trend since the beginning of the year, with its price nearly doubling from the start of 2024. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is less than $9,000 away from a new all time high. And with inflows for the Bitcoin ETFs showing no signs of slowing down, and with the halving coming, many market participants are wondering if Bitcoin will hit a new all time high before the halving for the first time ever.

  "article_detailed_content": "Grayscale amended a regulatory filing through which it intends to convert its Ethereum Trust to a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). The company’s March 15 amendment strengthens its earlier filing in multiple ways. The update supports the argument that surveillance sharing within the CME ETH market is sufficient to protect against fraud and manipulation in the spot ETH market. Grayscale’s latest amendment includes a correlation analysis conducted by Coinbase as evidence of sufficient market correlation. Coinbase found that the CME ETH futures market has been “consistently and highly correlated” with the spot Ethereum market for roughly the past three years. The rate is higher than the correlation that the SEC found between the CME Bitcoin futures market and the spot Bitcoin market. Grayscale’s amendment also expands on the creation and redemption of ETF shares. Notably, this section describes only cash creations and redemptions. It accordingly states that authorized participants cannot purchase, hold, deliver, or receive ETH. According to the filing, Grayscale Ethereum Trust now holds $11.8 billion in assets under management (AUM) instead of $4.8 billion of AUM. The conversion of the fund to an ETF would unlock over $1.73 billion of value instead of the $1.6 billion previously estimated. Grayscale advocates for ETF Craig Salm, Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer, acknowledged the filing and emphasized the expected broad appeal of spot Ethereum ETFs. He wrote on X that investors “want and deserve access to Ethereum in the form of a spot Ethereum ETF.” Salm added that the case for an Ethereum ETF “is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs.” Market manipulation and creation/redemption methods were key concerns before spot Bitcoin ETFs gained approval this January. Grayscale’s latest amendment is vital as it addresses those same issues in the context of Ethereum ETFs. Grayscale’s amendment comes alongside declining expectations of regulatory approval. Polymarket places the odds of Ethereum ETF approval by the end of May at just 26% as of March 15.

  "article_detailed_content": "MicroStrategy could raise as much as $600 million from its latest convertible debt offering to purchase more Bitcoin. However, JPMorgan analysts have reportedly cautioned that the firm’s reliance on debt to purchase Bitcoin could exacerbate a market downturn. The firm, led by BTC advocate Michael Saylor, has acquired over 15,000 BTC worth nearly $1 billion since the year began, primarily financed through a convertible debt offering. According to the analysts, this funding approach has turned MicroStrategy into a leveraged player in the Bitcoin arena, amplifying the ongoing market rally. They added that such debt-funded Bitcoin acquisitions contribute to market froth and increase the likelihood of more significant deleveraging in future downturns. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge to a record-breaking high of over $73,000, a sharp downturn has occurred, with prices dipping approximately 4% to around $68,000 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. Pricing details According to a March 15 statement, MicroStrategy plans to price its latest issuance of senior convertible notes at $525 million, with purchasers also granted an option to acquire up to an additional $78.5 million of the offering. As such, the anticipated proceeds from this offering range between $515 million and approximately $592.3 million. The notes are slated to mature by March 2031, carrying an annual interest rate of 0.875%, payable semi-annually. Investors who hold these notes will enjoy certain rights like the ability to request repurchase under certain conditions. Additionally, they will retain the flexibility to convert their notes into either cash or shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock. The conversion rate for these notes stands at $2,327.31 per share, marking a premium of roughly 40% over MicroStrategy’s average share price of $1662.20. The private offering targets qualified institutional buyers and remains subject to prevailing market conditions and other pertinent factors. Its sales would close by March 18.

  "article_detailed_content": "After a face-melting rally in the AI crypto sector over the past few months, investors appear to have taken a profit-taking approach over the past few days. The sector soared past $10 billion in mid-February, buoyed by Bittensor’s remarkable climb to a $4 billion market cap with an increase of over 220% in 2024. By March, the sector had exploded to over $25 billion in market cap. Top AI coins surge in 2024 (Source: TradingView) Around March 9, several projects hit new all-time highs, including Bittensor, Fetch, OriginTrail, Worldcoin, and Arkham, pushing the market cap close to $30 billion. In the past few days, the sector has cooled to below $25 billion in market cap as investors seem to be taking profits after a potentially overheated market surge. While Bitcoin has also dipped, as of press time, it sits just 6% below its all-time high, while the top 10 AI crypto projects are mostly down over 20%. Top 10 AI coins Interestingly, many AI crypto coins have not recently been as closely correlated with Bitcoin as the rest of the market. Bittensor and Fetch, specifically have seemingly been treading their own course, moving down only when Bitcoin has made substantial moves. Even then, the coins often had a delayed reaction or moved against Bitcoin. Fetch increased 140% in four days since March 6 before slightly retracing approximately 20%. Across the board, since the sector’s peak on March 9, Fetch is down 4%, ICP is down 11%, The Graph is down 12%, Singularity is down 13%, and Bittensor is down 12.8%. Top AI coins fall in past days (Source: TradingView) While the rise of AI in 2023 saw an influx of new AI-related memecoins and hype projects, those currently sitting toward the top of the sector chart are primarily focused on real-life implementation of decentralized AI tooling. The work has attracted the attention of Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, Erik Voorhees, and other notable players in the crypto space. The importance of decentralized AI models likely aligns with that of decentralized finance as the progress of AI development continues to ramp up. Blockchain and tokenization appear solid bedfellows for a distributed AI network, indicating the recent retracement is possibly profit-taking rather than investors losing faith in the burgeoning sector. However, with such rapid gains, it is also likely that investors will be eager to see progress in delivering technology. Many of the top progress have live mainnets with projects actively building. The critical next step is to see whether a network effect can bring users on chain to engage with this fascinating cross-section of AI and blockchain. Bittensor, for one, is undoubtedly seeing demand for adoption as the cost to register one of its 32 subnets has risen from around $200,000 to over $5 million this month alone, with the price set by market forces rather than any centralized entity.

  "author": {

  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley said Bitcoin needs to “change as an asset class” for the investment firm to consider it as a viable option and has no intention of changing its mind about spot Bitcoin ETFs until that happens. Buckley made the statement in a preview clip of an upcoming webcast posted on March 15. The full conversation with CIO Greg Davis will be published on March 19. Too volatile Buckley said that Vanguard does not intend to change its stance toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily because it does not believe they belong in long-term and retirement portfolios. He added: “Something like bitcoin is just too volatile and it’s not a store of value — it hasn’t been… It is speculative, really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio.” The Vanguard CEO said that Bitcoin prices recently fell alongside stock prices, and it is difficult to predict the flagship crypto’s growth. These factors make it difficult to determine how to include Bitcoin ETFs in portfolios. Buckley said the firm focuses on investing in asset classes with underlying cash flows, such as stocks or bonds, which are easier to value and model. Buckley plans to retire before the end of 2024 but his departure is unlikely to change Vanguard’s stance as the beliefs are part of the firm’s investment philosophy. Vanguard’s past complaints Vanguard previously confirmed that it would not offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs shortly after the funds gained approval in January 2024. The company commented more extensively on its concerns later in the month and said that Bitcoin was an “immature asset class.” Vanguard’s Global Head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations, Janel Jackson, notably commented that crypto “can create havoc within a portfolio” due to its short history and lack of inherent value and cash flow. Meanwhile, the firm’s Head of Brokerage & Investments, Andrew Kadjeski, explained that the firm aims to serve long-term, buy-and-hold investors. The company’s history of avoiding short-term market trends, including steering clear of internet funds in the 1990s and removing access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs in 2019 and over-the-counter stocks in 2022, illustrates a historic strategy of prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains. Vanguard’s stance has generated significant discussion within the investment community, with some clients expressing frustration over the firm’s reluctance to include Bitcoin in its investment offerings. Despite the controversy and potential market pressure, Vanguard remains steadfast in its traditional investment approach, focusing on asset classes it deems fundamental for sustained investment success.

  "article_detailed_content": "Binance spun off its $10 billion venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity that will no longer be under the group’s purview weeks ago. Bloomberg drew attention to the silent change in a March 15 report, which revealed that Binance Labs had added a disclaimer about the change on its website earlier in the year. Based on snapshots from Archive.org, the venture firm added the disclaimer in late February: “Binance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).” The spin-off is one of the most significant decisions made under the exchange’s new CEO, Richard Teng, since taking over four months ago. He previously headed the exchange’s Singapore division and has no publicly listed role at Binance Labs. The companies did not respond to a request for comment as of press time, and the reasons behind the decision to split the venture capital division are unclear. Licensing the brand Binance Labs Investment Director Alex Odagiu told Bloomberg that the venture capital firm operates independently but will continue to use the Binance brand name under a licensing agreement. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs remains dedicated to its foundational mission of discovering and investing in promising crypto projects. Odagiu reaffirmed the commitment, stressing that the venture’s focus on supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem remains unchanged. The separation entails distinct contractual agreements for Binance Labs staff, mirroring the organizational structure seen in other Binance-supported entities such as the BNB Chain. Bloomberg identified the value of Binance Labs as close to $10 billion. The company’s website indicates that it has supported more than 200 crypto projects over six years. Its portfolio notably includes the top-twenty market cap blockchain Polygon, the metaverse-focused platform The Sandbox, and the decentralized finance platform CurveFi. Binance reshuffled leadership This strategic pivot comes in the wake of Binance’s recent settlement with US regulatory bodies, culminating in a hefty $4.3 billion fine and the replacement of its founder, Changpeng Zhao, with Teng as CEO. The reorganization appears to be part of a broader strategy to navigate the post-settlement landscape, ensuring compliance and operational resilience. Under the leadership of Binance co-founder Yi He, Binance Labs has emerged as a pivotal force in the crypto venture capital arena. Funded primarily through the exchange’s profits, it has established itself as a key player, supporting approximately 250 projects, including notable names like Sky Mavis, Aptos Labs, and Polygon. The venture operates both as an investor and an incubator, with a focus on nurturing startups across various blockchain ecosystems.

  "article_detailed_content": "Federal prosecutors have requested a prison sentence of 40 to 50 years for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) following his conviction for conducting one of the most significant financial frauds in recent times through the misappropriation of over $8 billion of customer funds. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a sentencing memorandum detailing SBF’s wide-ranging fraudulent activities on March 15. According to the filing, his malpractices not only undermined the integrity of the financial and political systems but also left tens of thousands of victims across several continents grappling with significant losses. Greed and ambition The government’s filing paints a picture of SBF as a figure driven by unparalleled greed and ambition, whose actions reached into the political arena through unlawful contributions and even extended overseas with attempts to bribe Chinese government officials. Beyond the financial deceit at FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm he founded, SBF was also involved in banking misconduct, including operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and misleading banks to facilitate his operations. In the aftermath of FTX’s bankruptcy, SBF attempted to deflect blame and evade responsibility, further complicating the legal proceedings and highlighting a persistent refusal to acknowledge the scope of his wrongdoing. The prosecutors also outlined instances of obstruction of justice, including his use of encrypted messaging to delete evidence and tampering with witnesses. Extraordinary punishment for extraordinary crimes The request for a 40 to 50-year sentence emphasizes the severity of SBF’s actions and reflects the prosecution’s stance on the need for a punishment that matches the extraordinary impact of his crimes. The memorandum argues that such a sentence is necessary not only to provide justice for the victims but also to serve as a deterrent against similar crimes in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. In addition to the prison term, the government is seeking forfeiture of assets acquired through the criminal activities and has proposed victim compensation through remission as an alternative to traditional restitution. This approach aims to address the financial harm suffered by the victims, some of whom lost their life savings in the collapse of FTX. SBF’s sentencing is set for March 28, marking a pivotal moment in bringing justice to the thousands of FTX customers who were wronged. The case stands as a significant chapter in the legal challenges facing the digital finance world.

  "article_detailed_content": "Solana (SOL) broke new ground on March 15 after an 11% rally brought its market capitalization to a new all-time high of $82.5 billion at a price of $186.77 per token despite the overall downtrend, which saw the market contract by 4%. This achievement surpasses its prior peak market cap of approximately $77.9 billion — observed in November 2021 at its all-time high of $259.96 — signaling strong investor confidence and a growing interest in the digital asset. SOL was trading at $181.35 as of press time — up 9.29% over the past 24 hours, with a market cap hovering just above $80 billion, according to CryptoSlate data. Sol ecosystem thriving Adding to Solana’s impressive week, the network saw a record-breaking number of new addresses, with a daily average of 738,040 new addresses based on a seven-day moving average. This uptick in new addresses highlights the growing community and interest in the Solana ecosystem, which saw a green day of trading, with most tokens recording significant gains. DEX native tokens — including Raydium and the recently launched Jupiter and Jito — saw double-digit gains over the past day. RAY and JUP were up more than 30%, while JITO recorded gains 10%. Meanwhile, the largest Solana-based memecoins like WIF and BONK saw a drawdown mimicking the wider market as investors turned to smaller cap tokens on DEXs amid renewed memecoin frenzy. Memecoin fever The current enthusiasm surrounding Solana is largely fueled by the vibrant trading activity related to newly launched memecoins on the network following a dramatic surge in memecoins this year. Noteworthy gains were observed in memecoins like Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Bonk, which have posted gains ranging from 117% to 554% over the past 30 days. This surge in memecoin activity has drawn considerable attention to Solana, highlighting its utility and growing relevance in the crypto space. The appeal of memecoins on the Solana network has been attributed to their accessibility and entertainment value. The trend reflects a broader interest in engaging with the crypto market in a fun and accessible manner.

  "article_detailed_content": "Hong Kong financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), issued a public warning about MEXC’s unlicensed operations within its jurisdictions. SFC stated: “The entity purports to be a virtual asset trading platform operating at the above website. It has been targeting Hong Kong investors but is not licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission.” Consequently, the platform has been added to Hong Kong’s list of suspicious virtual asset trading platforms, including other notable crypto firms like ByBit. Local laws violation Per the SFC, MEXC’s operation in the city-state violated local laws. According to the SFC: “Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, it is an offence to carry on a business of providing a virtual asset service (ie, operating a virtual asset exchange) in Hong Kong and/or actively market such services to Hong Kong investors without a licence.” This is not the first time the SFC has issued a public warning related to the MEXC exchange. Earlier in the year, the regulator stated that scammers were pretending to be from the crypto trading platform and luring unsuspecting victims into participating in what appears to be a crypto investment scam. The scammers used links with addresses that start with “MEXC” and end in random letters, similar to phishing links. As such, the SFC said it may pursue regulatory action against the platform if necessary. “The SFC will not hesitate to take enforcement action against unlicensed activities where appropriate,” it added. Meanwhile, the financial regulator warned crypto investors against trading on unregistered platforms, adding that they risk losing their investment if the platform experiences any form of failure. SFC’s MEXC warning is unsurprising, considering the financial watchdog recently ended its registration window for crypto firms to apply for licensing to operate within the Asian city-state. Unregistered entities must close their businesses by the end of May. The post Hong Kong SFC expands violations list adding MEXC for unlicensed operations appeared first on CryptoSlate.",

  "article_detailed_content": "El Salvador received Bitcoin donations after President Nayib Bukele shared the Central American country’s digital wallet address with the public. In a March 14 post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Bukele revealed that the country transferred “a big chunk of our Bitcoin to a cold wallet and stored that cold wallet in a physical vault within our national territory.” The on-chain address, described by Bukele as the country’s “first piggy bank,” showed that the government holds ‎5,689 BTC, equivalent to $383 million as of press time, according to BitInfoCharts data. El Salvador’s BTC bag This disclosure reveals a substantially larger Bitcoin treasury for El Salvador than previously estimated. Public trackers like Nayibtracker and Bitcoin Treasuries had previously placed the nation’s holdings at 2864 BTC, estimated at $193 million. Nonetheless, the sizable treasury aligns with recent revelations by Bukele, who highlighted multiple revenue streams beyond mere acquisition. These include BTC earnings from citizenship sales, currency exchanges for local businesses, mining activities, and other undisclosed government services. Moreover, President Bukele has consistently reiterated El Salvador’s commitment to holding onto its Bitcoin reserves, signaling a steadfast dedication to its crypto strategy for the long term. Donations and praises Following Bukele’s revelation, crypto enthusiasts praised the country’s move and swiftly began sending small amounts of BTC and rare Ordinals to the wallet. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said no other country has a bright trajectory like El Salvador while highlighting the country’s security, growth, economy, and talent. Femi Longe, a crypto stakeholder from Nigeria, said he looks “forward to a future where African countries keep a portion of their national reserves in Bitcoin instead of the US Dollars.” According to him: “This would weaken the hold the guardians of the current global economy & monetary system have on our progress as a continent.” Meanwhile, BitInfoCharts shows that the Central American country’s BTC wallet received more than $1000 worth of BTC donations in 30 transactions. In addition, Ordiscan reveals that the wallet boasts 67 Ordinal inscriptions, comprising BRC-20 tokens, textual inscriptions, images, and others.

  "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin’s futures market is showcasing signs that have historically signalled bullish sentiment. Analysts are turning their attention to the Bitcoin futures basis—a metric representing the differential between the futures price of Bitcoin and its spot price. Recent data has revealed that this basis has escalated to unprecedented levels since Bitcoin’s all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Bullish Indications From Bitcoin Futures Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer, Luuk Strijers, has highlighted the current state of the Bitcoin futures basis, which ranges between 18% to 25% annually, a rate reminiscent of the market conditions in 2021. According to Strijers’s comment, this elevated basis is not just a number but a lucrative opportunity for derivatives traders. By engaging in trades that involve buying Bitcoin in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures contracts at a premium, traders can secure a “dollar gain” that will materialize at the contract’s expiry, irrespective of Bitcoin’s price volatility. Strijers further noted that this strategy is particularly appealing in the current climate, fueled by the influx of new investments following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin halving event. The significance of the heightened futures basis extends beyond the mechanics of derivatives trading. It further reflects broader market optimism, “bolstered” by recent regulatory approvals and macroeconomic factors influencing cryptocurrency. The disparity between Bitcoin’s spot and futures prices suggests a confident market outlook, propelled by the anticipation of continued investment inflows and the impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Such conditions create a fertile ground for Bitcoin’s value to surge, as historical precedents have often linked bullish futures basis rates with periods of substantial price appreciation. Market Sentiment And Halving Cycles While Bitcoin’s current market performance exhibits a bearish trajectory, with a 3.9% dip bringing its price to $68,203, market analysts advise against interpreting this as a negative signal. Rekt Capital, a respected figure in crypto analysis, views the recent price correction as a “positive adjustment” preceding the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving in April. Halving events, which reduce the block reward for miners, thus slowing the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, have traditionally catalyzed significant price rallies due to the resulting supply constraints. Rekt Capital’s analysis parallels current market movements and historical patterns observed in previous halving cycles. According to the analyst, despite the swift pace of these cycles, they exhibit a consistent sequence of a pre-halving rally followed by a retracement phase—both of which align with Bitcoin’s current trajectory. This cyclical perspective suggests that the recent dip is merely a temporary setback, setting the stage for the next bullish phase post-halving. #BTC Though there are signs of BTC experiencing an Accelerated Cycle… History still continues to repeat, nonetheless$BTC broke out into a “Pre-Halving Rally” right on schedule And now, #Bitcoin is transitioning into its “Pre-Halving Retrace” right on schedule#Crypto https://t.co/Egqxs9ritl pic.twitter.com/lj0IdQtBEE — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) March 15, 2024 Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView",

  "article_detailed_content": "In a recent report by market intelligence firm Chainalysis, it has been revealed that global crypto gains in 2023 amounted to a staggering $37.6 billion. This profit surge reflects improved asset prices and market sentiment compared to 2022. Although this figure falls short of the $159.7 billion gains witnessed during the 2021 bull market, it signifies a significant recovery from the estimated losses of $127.1 billion experienced in 2022. Sharp Surge In Crypto Gains The report suggests that despite similar growth rates in crypto asset prices in 2021 and 2023, the total gains for the latter year were lower. According to Chainalysis, this discrepancy could potentially be attributed to investors’ decreased inclination to convert their crypto assets into cash. The analysis further suggests that investors in 2023 seem to have anticipated further price increases, as crypto asset prices did not exceed previous all-time highs (ATHs) during the year, unlike in 2021. Cryptocurrency gains remained relatively consistent throughout 2023, except for two consecutive months of losses in August and September, as seen in the image above. However, gains surged sharply thereafter, with November and December eclipsing all previous months. United States Leads Leading the pack in cryptocurrency gains was the United States, with an estimated $9.36 billion in profits in 2023. The United Kingdom secured the second position with an estimated $1.39 billion in crypto gains. Notably, several upper and lower-middle-income countries, particularly in Asia, such as Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India, achieved significant gains, each surpassing $1 billion and ranking within the top six countries worldwide. Chainalysis had previously observed strong cryptocurrency adoption in these income categories, particularly in “lower-middle-income” countries, which demonstrated resilience even during the recent bear market. The gains estimates indicate that investors in these countries have reaped substantial benefits from embracing the asset class. Ultimately, the Chainalysis report suggests that the positive trends observed in 2023 have carried over into 2024, with prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) hitting all-time highs of $73,700 following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and increased institutional adoption. If these trends persist, the firm believes that it is conceivable that gains in 2024 will align more closely with those witnessed in 2021. As of this writing, the total crypto market cap valuation stands at $2.5 trillion, a sharp drop of over 4% in the last 24 hours alone, and down from Thursday’s two-year high of $2.7 trillion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $68,400 after dropping as low as $65,500 but has quickly regained its current trading price, limiting losses to 4% over the past 24 hours.

If these trends persist, the firm believes that it is conceivable that gains in 2024 will align more closely with those witnessed in 2021. As of this writing, the total crypto market cap valuation stands at $2.5 trillion, a sharp drop of over 4% in the last 24 hours alone, and down from Thursday’s two-year high of $2.7 trillion. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $68,400 after dropping as low as $65,500 but has quickly regained its current trading price, limiting losses to 4% over the past 24 hours.

  "article_detailed_content": "On-chain data suggests more than 533,330 addresses FOMO’d into Bitcoin above $70,180. Following the latest plunge, these investors would all be in losses. Over 500K Bitcoin Addresses Have A Cost Basis Between $70,180 & $71,340 As pointed out by analyst Ali in a post on X, many investors have bought at the recently high price levels. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the distribution of the BTC supply looks right now across the various price ranges. The data is from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which has used on-chain data to determine the average acquisition price for any given address based on when its coins moved into its balance. In the chart, the size of the dots represents the amount of coins that have their cost basis inside the corresponding range. It would appear that the $64,743 and $66,700 range is below the current price that hosts the cost basis of a significant amount of addresses. More particularly, 382,000 addresses acquired 275,450 BTC at these levels. As the Bitcoin spot price is currently trading above this range, all these investors would naturally be carrying some profits. Generally, investors are sensitive to retests of their cost basis, as such retests can potentially flip their profit-loss status. For holders who were in profit before the retest, the dip may appear as an opportunity to buy more. The emerging reaction can be significant when many hands share their cost basis inside the same narrow range. If this retest occurs from above, the asset could feel some support as these investors rush to accumulate more. Since the $64,743 to $66,700 range is dense with investors and is situated below the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, it could act as a major support center. “Monitoring this level closely is crucial, as losing it could shift the focus to the next significant demand zone between $60,760 and $62,790, safeguarded by 797,500 addresses with over 298,000 BTC,” notes Ali. In terms of the levels above, the $70,180 to $71,340 range particularly stands out, as 533,330 addresses bought a total of almost 433,000 BTC. A lot of these new buyers would be those FOMO’ing into the asset after seeing it explore new all-time highs. This large block, however, may serve as a point of resistance for the cryptocurrency. These fresh hands might sell just as quickly as they bought in when a retest of their cost basis happens since they may be willing to just exit at their break-even, fearing more drops in the near future. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a sharp correction during the past day, following which its spot price is now trading around the $67,900 level.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular memecoin, has experienced a notable decline. It dropped nearly 20% over the past week and continued a 13% fall in just the past 24 hours. This downturn occurs amid a broader bearish trend across the crypto landscape. However, detailed on-chain analysis has uncovered specific factors contributing to SHIB’s sharp decline. Whale Movements And Market Influence Insights from IntoTheBlock have shed light on large transaction activities, often indicative of “whale” movements, which have seen a general decrease since March 5, further compounding the downward pressure on SHIB’s price. The role of speculative trading in influencing SHIB’s market performance has also become increasingly apparent. Data pointing to the holding time of transacted coins suggests a shift towards short-term trading strategies among investors, possibly in pursuit of quick profits. Such behaviors are underscored by a significant reduction in the average holding period of coins, from four weeks to just two months as of mid-March, accompanied by a transaction volume of 2.12 trillion SHIB. This trend towards speculative trading has been a key driver behind the memecoin’s recent price movements, reflecting the broader dynamics within the cryptocurrency market. The decrease in large transactions involving Shiba Inu signifies dwindling confidence among whales, whose actions can profoundly impact market direction. The observed decline in whale activities aligns with a broader caution in the crypto market, where investors reevaluate their positions amid shifting market conditions. Shiba Inu Bright Horizon Despite the current downturn, Shiba Inu remains a focal point within the altcoin sector, buoyed by optimistic predictions from crypto analysts. Michaël van de Poppe, a well-regarded figure in the crypto analysis community, has recently posited that altcoins, are set for significant rallies, potentially positioning Shiba Inu for a notable rebound as the market stabilizes.

  "article_detailed_content": "Amid the bullish sentiment around the crypto landscape, the Altcoin overall market cap has displayed positive strength as many investors and traders are throwing capital into several altcoins ahead of the bull cycle. Altcoin Market To Rally Toward $425 Billion Since Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, many cryptocurrency analysts anticipate a surge in the altcoin market cap. Rekt Capital, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has shared a positive prediction regarding the altcoins market cap with the community on X. The expert analysis delves into the current state of the market and its potential to surge higher in the coming months. His projections came in light of the altcoin season index showing advancement, which suggests that its season is almost here. According to the analyst, the market has been “redirected into the blue-circled testing area,” which was caused by rejection from the “red-circled circle zone.” However, the market has rebounded since then, indicating an increased interest from market investors. Furthermore, Rekt Capital noted that the market has surpassed the “$315 billion red line of resistance.” As a result, the red line resistance level has now been changed to a “new support level.” Due to this, the crypto analyst anticipates a surge to the “light blue circle” at the $425 billion threshold in the upcoming months. The post read: The red-circled area rejected the Altcoin Market back into the blue-circled retesting zone. Since then, the Altcoin Market Cap has recovered, broken beyond the red $315bn resistance, and turned recently into new support. Next is the light blue circle, over time. However, Rekt Capital also asserted in another recent post that the “$315 billion mark is still being retested by alts market cap new support.” It has been unable to move past it despite today’s double-digit declines on several altcoins. Even though the market is still retesting the aforementioned level, Rekt Capital is confident that it will “revisit the $425 billion resistance” soon. He anticipates the market revisiting the level before the Bitcoin Halving event, expected to take place in April. Alts Gains Are Sustable And Likely To Crash Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bitcoin technology firm JAN3, Samson Mow, has also shared his insights regarding the altcoin market. Despite anticipating a rise in the altcoin market, Mow highlighted that he expects alts to “crash in the upcoming weeks.” According to Mow, alts have been monitoring the “increase in Bitcoin” after launching BTC Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, altcoins do not possess “the $500 million to $1 billion” daily inflows seen with Bitcoin. Consequently, this should be the “major sign” that their gains “can not” be maintained. “MSTR has a $30 billion market cap, Solana is $73 billion. That is absurd. A correction is overdue,” he added.",

  "article_detailed_content": "FLOKI and the dog-themed cryptocurrencies have been the talk of the town recently. BONK and dogwifhat (WIF) reached new all-time highs (ATH) this month, while the Viking dog-based token climbed to levels not seen since the previous bull run. During this rally, memecoins have soared alongside the rest of the cryptocurrencies. However, in the past 24 hours, the market went from flying to crashing as the prices of most cryptocurrencies followed the recent Bitcoin dip. Is FLOKI Ready To Continue Its Expansion? Last week, FLOKI, the fifth largest memecoin by market cap, soared by over 60% after announcing its listing in two major crypto exchanges in Asia and the Middle East. The news propelled the token’s price to $0.0002043. Crypto Analyst Byzantine General shared on X (formerly Twitter) his view on the token’s recent performance.

  "article_detailed_content": "Analysts from private wealth management firm, Bernstein have reaffirmed their previous Bitcoin prediction, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency has a greater chance to reach $150,000 by 2025. Bitcoin $150,000 Price Forecast Grows Stronger Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra said in a note to clients on Monday that they were now more convinced of Bitcoin’s exponential surge to new all-time highs at around $150,000 by mid-2025. The analyst’s statements were a reiteration of their earlier Bitcoin forecast in November 2023, when they predicted the price of Bitcoin to surge to $150,000. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around a price of $35,000, putting the analysts’ estimate at around five times the price of BTC. Now with BTC recently witnessing remarkable surges to new all time highs above $71,000, and potentially continuing its upward momentum, Bernstein analysts’ forecast seems more probable. Analysts from the private wealth investment firm have disclosed several factors that could trigger BTC’s bullish momentum. Highlighting the success and surging demand for Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), the company boldly affirmed that large volume of inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs could significantly contribute towards increasing the value of BTC. “We estimated $10 billion inflows for 2024 and another $60 billion for 2025. In the last 40 trading days since the ETF launch on Jan 10, Bitcoin ETF inflows have crossed $9.5 billion already,” Bernstein analysts wrote. Sharing the sentiment of most crypto analysts in the market, Bernstein analysts believe that the price of BTC could experience a fresh “break out” after the halving event in April 2024. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $68,218, witnessing a slight price correction of about 6.96% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Miners To Become Top Beneficiaries Of BTC Surge In their note, Bernstein analysts highlighted that investing in Bitcoin miners could be the best equity proxy to BTC. According to their analysis, BTC miners typically outperform during BTC bullish cycles and conversely underperform during bearish periods. As Bitcoin rapidly rises to all time highs above $71,000, Bernstein analysts expect that institutional interest in Bitcoin related equities could top over, with BTC miners becoming one of the largest beneficiaries. Despite various analysts predicting that the next Bitcoin halving could potentially become a death sentence to small mining companies and solo miners, Bernstein analysts have revealed that the rising price of BTC and elevated transaction fees could serve as a cushioning mechanism for miners during the halving period.",

  "article_detailed_content": "As Bitcoin drops below $68,000, history suggests this correction is rather tame for bull markets, as plunges to this deep on-chain level have been the norm. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Price Is Currently Around $53,200 As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a post on X, BTC still has a decent margin over the realized price of the short-term holders. The “realized price” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of the average price at which the Bitcoin investors acquired their coins. The indicator calculates this value by going through the transaction history of each coin and assuming that the last transfer of it was the last time it was purchased (that is, the price at the time is its current cost basis). When the spot value of the cryptocurrency dips below the realized price, it means that the average investor is now in a state of loss. On the other hand, a break above implies the market as a whole has entered into net profits. In the context of the current discussion, the realized price for only a particular segment of the investors is of interest: the “short-term holders” (STHs). The STHs include all the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin realized price specifically for this cohort: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin STH realized price has shot up recently as the price of the asset has gone up. This makes sense, as this group includes the most recent buyers, who would continuously be buying at higher prices in an uptrend, thus raising their average cost basis. At present, this cohort’s realized price is about $53,200. During the past day, BTC has seen a sharp drop that has taken its price below the $68,000 mark, but clearly, the STHs would still be in high profits even after this drawdown. “In previous bull markets, the average cost basis of short-term holders was fully reset multiple times,” explains Maartunn. This trend is most prominent in the data for the 2017 bull run when the price retested this level several times. An interesting pattern that has been held is that these retests of the level during bull trends have generally resulted in the cryptocurrency finding support and turning itself back around. The explanation for this trend may lie in the fickle nature of the STHs. The cost basis is an important level for these investors, and when a retest of it happens, they panic and show some reaction. During uptrends, these holders are more likely to buy more when a retest of their cost basis occurs since they may think that the same price levels that were profitable earlier will be so again in the near future. Naturally, it’s not a certainty that Bitcoin would also end up retesting this level in this bull market. Still, a correction might reach close to it if the historical precedent is anything to go by.

  "article_detailed_content": "The crypto analyst who correctly called Dogwifhat’s (WIF) parabolic run has identified another Solana-based meme coin that could see a significant move to the upside. The analyst further suggested that WIF and this crypto token have striking similarities. A ‘God Candle’ Incoming For Myro Meme Coin Crypto analyst Bluntz Capital mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that it won’t be long before the Myro (MYRO) token sees a god candle. The analyst added that everyone would wish they had bought the meme coin when it finally breaks its current all-time high of $0.4 and “starts doing rapid multiples.” In a previous X post, Bluntz had suggested that MYRO is the next Solana-based meme coin to take off following WIF’s run to the top. The analyst had correctly predicted that WIF would attain the heights it is currently at right from when it was still trading at around $0.29. Back then, he stated that the meme coin would go “turbo parabolic.” Bluntz suggested that MYRO could follow a similar trajectory to WIF’s rise as he highlighted that both meme coins have the same chart pattern. MYRO, making a similar run to WIFs, could see it become the latest meme coin to join the billion-dollar club in terms of market cap. MYRO’s market cap currently stands at $340 million. Meanwhile, Bluntz isn’t the only analyst that MYRO could see a parabolic price surge soon enough. Crypto analyst Crypto Shadow also hinted that the meme coin will likely go “parabolic” soon enough. He believes this move to the upside will see MYRO rank with top meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and FLOKI. Solana-Based WIF’s Insane Run WIF, another Solana-based meme coin, is currently having an insane run, similar to the kind of run other top meme coins like DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) enjoyed during their breakout year in 2021. As a result, WIF is currently enjoying a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 1,700%, making it one of the most profitable crypto tokens since the beginning of 2024. WIF’s run has also seen it surpass BONK as the most valuable Solana meme coin, boasting a market cap of over $3 billion to BONK’s $2 billion. WIF now ranks as the fourth-largest by market cap, behind DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. However, if it somehow sustains this bullish momentum, it could soon surpass PEPE. Bluntz previously mentioned that WIF will flip at least two meme coins in this market cycle (it already flipped BONK) and further suggested that it could rise to become the second most valuable meme coin, only behind DOGE.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Data shows that Bitcoin Coinbase Premium has plunged into the red territory, which may explain why the asset’s price has crashed to under $68,000. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Turned Red As explained by the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant in a post on X, the BTC Coinbase Premium Index dropped into negative territory just hours before BTC went through its correction. The “Coinbase Premium Index” here refers to an indicator that tracks the percentage difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than on Binance right now. Such a trend implies that the users of the former platform are doing more buying than those of the latter. On the other hand, negative values imply the presence of higher selling pressure on Coinbase since the price of the cryptocurrency on Binance is currently greater. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index over the past few days: As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index had been positive earlier. Still, yesterday, the indicator dipped into the negative region and has since mostly remained inside it. Alongside these red values of the metric, the cryptocurrency’s price has taken a deep hit, as it has come back down to the $68,000 level. Given the close timing, the high selling pressure on Coinbase may have something to do with this drawdown. Coinbase is popularly known to be the preferred platform of US-based institutional investors, while Binance has more global traffic, so the Premium Index’s value can reflect the difference in the behaviors of American whales and world users. In this rally, the Coinbase Premium Index has generally remained positive as large US-based entities have accumulated. Given the change to red values, these investors may have now taken to selling instead, thus leading to the coin’s plunge. This indicator could be worth watching in the coming days. If it turns back positive for a sustained period of time, it would be a sign that the buyers are back and with them, so it might be an uptrend. Regarding the latest correction, smart-money tracker Lookonchain has pointed out that a Binance deposit wallet has moved BTC worth $329 million to a Binance hot wallet in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, this same whale also moved a similar amount of Bitcoin back during the correction earlier in the month, as the below chart shared by the X user shows. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,100, down 4% in the past 24 hours.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini has provided key insights into the future price trajectory of Shiba Inu. The AI model has disclosed three potential price targets for SHIB by the end of 2024. SHIB Price Outlook By End Of The Year Gemini, Google’s most capable AI model has predicted the price of SHIB to surge by the end of 2024. According to the chat bot, Shiba Inu could potentially witness a massive rally, pushing it to new all-time highs during this time line. Sharing three distinct scenarios where Shiba Inu is set to experience a significant price rally, Gemini disclosed that SHIB could break past key resistance levels to surge to $0.0002, shedding off a zero from its current price and reflecting a massive 410% surge. In the second price outlook, the AI chatbot predicts that the price of SHIB could witness a surge to $0.0001. This price increase would require SHIB to rally by at least 155%, taking advantage of market’s bullish trends and investor sentiment to push its price upwards. The third and final price outlook by Google’s Gemini reveals a more moderate price increase for SHIB. According to the AI model, SHIB’s price is expected to surge to $0.00005 by December 2024. This price increase depicts a relatively low growth for the cryptocurrency, potentially signaling impending bearish trends in the future. Shiba Inu Witnesses Major Price Correction Since the beginning of the year, the price of SHIB has been on an upward momentum, amassing significant gains that has further solidified its position in the crypto industry. The cryptocurrency has also garnered a considerable amount of interest from both investors and traders, successfully rising to the world’s top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite various crypto analysts predicting that SHIB will maintain its bullish trajectory, the cryptocurrency has been witnessing unexpected price declines lately. The price of SHIB experienced a significant drop below $0.00003, trading at $0.000029 at the time of writing, and reflecting a steep decline of 10.75% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency had previously experienced a price increase of approximately 205.66% over the past month. However, it seems bearish trends may be taking over, as SHIB has been displaying mostly red candle sticks on its weekly price charts, according to CoinMarketCap. While the reason for this unexpected price drop has not yet been determined, Shiba Inu is still on a relatively bullish path, which is evident in its previous price performance over the past few months. Moreover, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has also remained bullish on the doggy-themed meme coin, predicting that SHIB could potentially become the leading cryptocurrency in the upcoming meme coin season.",

  "article_detailed_content": "According to a Bloomberg report, the crypto lobby in the United States has issued a stark warning to political candidates, demanding their support or risk defeat at the ballot box in the November 5, 2024, elections. Citing the recent defeat of Democratic Representative Katie Porter in California’s Senate primary as evidence, the digital asset industry points to its significant financial backing and influence on elections. With sympathetic billionaires and a well-funded pro-crypto super political action committee (PAC), the industry aims to shape the political landscape in favor of cryptocurrency-friendly candidates. Industry Giants Pour $10M Into Securing Pro-Crypto Nominees Rich industry players have reportedly contributed $10 million to advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts that allegedly helped defeat Katie Porter in the open primary. That outcome paved the way for fellow Democrat Adam Schiff, perceived as more pro-crypto, to secure the nomination, the report noted. According to the report, the lobby plans to use Porter’s loss as an example to pressure other vulnerable Democratic allies, warning that aligning with crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren could make their reelection campaigns more difficult. Digital asset advocates have reportedly garnered significant financial support from sympathetic billionaires and industry leaders. The pro-crypto Super PAC, Fairshake, has amassed a “war chest” of approximately $75 million for use in the US elections. Notable backers include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Gemini exchange founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz. With significant resources, the lobby aims to influence political outcomes and promote candidates who support the industry’s interests. Balancing Innovation And Regulation The digital asset industry faces legislative proposals to combat illicit finance, with some bills seeking to apply anti-money laundering rules to crypto firms. Groups like the Blockchain Association and the Chamber of Digital Commerce argue that such requirements would be “unworkable” and potentially “fatal” for the industry in the US. While criminal networks have exploited cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, the industry emphasizes the need for balanced regulation that addresses concerns without stifling innovation. Bloomberg observes that the crypto industry’s growing political influence represents a significant shift from when it faced scandals and business failures a year ago. Despite regulatory scrutiny and challenges in establishing practical use cases for the technology, the industry has rebounded and now wields financial clout. Lawmakers recognize the industry’s ability to pour millions of dollars into races, making it a force to be reckoned with in the political arena.

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Scott Matherson"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "Crypto expert Scott Melker, also known as the ‘Wolf of All Streets,” has laid down a theory of when mainstream demand for crypto will return in this bull market. Interestingly, his theory revolved around the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), which he believes could attract non-crypto natives back into the crypto space. Dogecoin’s Role In Attracting Mainstream Demand For Crypto Melker mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that mainstream FOMO (fear of missing out) will return to the crypto market when the foremost meme coin hits a new all-time high (ATH). His belief is based on the fact that “mainstream fervor” in the last bull cycle was driven by dog coins and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). He alluded to how these individuals joined waiting lists on exchanges just to sign up and buy DOGE. As such, DOGE needs to make a similar run to the one in 2021 to attract these people back into the space and get them “excited about the market again.” DOGE hitting a new ATH would be a good start since it would put all investments from the previous cycle in profits. Melker suggested that Bitcoin hitting new ATHs hasn’t been sufficient enough to attract this class of investors as there is still “seemingly minimal mainstream interest.” He joked that he has so far not gotten calls from old friends and family asking if they should buy Bitcoin. Although DOGE isn’t exactly at the center of this bull cycle, meme coins are once again part of the leading narratives, with these crypto tokens gaining much interest from retail investors. However, there is the feeling that DOGE could draw a lot of attention once it makes a parabolic rise that causes it to hit a new ATH. What Dogecoin Needs For A New ATH In 2021, DOGE surged by over 26,000% to hit an ATH of $0.7376. This price surge was partly due to the broader acceptance the meme coin began to enjoy, with entities like the NBA team Dallas Mavericks accepting it as a payment option. Therefore, an increase in DOGE’s use case could be critical for its performance in this bull run. Interestingly, DOGE’s primary supporter and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, recently hinted that his company, Tesla, would eventually begin accepting the meme coin as a payment method. Such development would no doubt send bullish signals throughout the DOGE ecosystem and positively affect its price. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1635, down over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Samuel Edyme"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has recently raised concerns over Bybit, marking it as a platform of suspicion. This move comes amid a broader regulatory push within Hong Kong to oversee and regulate the crypto market. The SFC’s cautionary note addresses 11 investment products by Bybit, indicating potential risks these might pose to investors. Despite Bybit’s efforts to align with local regulations, including its Hong Kong entity, Spark Fintech Limited, applying for a crypto exchange license, the regulator’s spotlight on Bybit underscores the challenging landscape of crypto regulation. Bybit Regulatory Hurdles And Compliance Efforts This alert by the SFC highlights a critical moment for Bybit, a crypto exchange with a global footprint, as it navigates the complexities of compliance within different jurisdictions. The identified “suspicious” products span various offerings, from futures and options to wealth management services, emphasizing the regulator’s broad scrutiny. The SFC’s statement clarifies that no entity within the Bybit group holds a license or registration to conduct regulated activities in Hong Kong. With the deadline for crypto trading platforms to submit license applications looming, the SFC’s action serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance. Bybit’s distinction between its international operations and the local entity, Spark Fintech Limited, reflects the complex nature of crypto regulations and platforms’ efforts to adapt to diverse regulatory demands. The Broader Context Of Crypto Regulation In Hong Kong Notably, the Bybit regulatory hurdle comes at a time when Hong Kong’s SFC shared a recent mandate that requires all crypto trading platforms within its jurisdiction to apply for a license by February 29 or risk being shut down by May 31. Meanwhile, as Hong Kong aims to position itself as a regulated stronghold for the crypto industry, it has attracted license applications from 24 entities eager to operate within the city. Among these applicants are prominent industry names like OKX, Crypto.com, and even Bybit, all vying for a chance to comply with the city’s stringent regulations to safeguard investors. However, the regulatory framework’s focus on investor protection comes with compliance costs that challenge some entities. Given these regulatory shifts, HTX, formerly Huobi Global, has retracted its application for a crypto exchange license in Hong Kong. This retreat marks a significant change in direction for HTX, which had previously expressed a strong desire to set up a regulated exchange in Hong Kong, backed by the support of TRON founder Justin Sun.

  "article_detailed_content": "Data shows over $668 million in cryptocurrency long contracts have been squeezed following Bitcoin’s crash under the $68,000 level. Bitcoin Has Registered A Drop Of 7% In The Last 24 Hours Right after setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) not too far from the $74,000 level, the Bitcoin price has reversed its trajectory sharply during the past day. The below chart shows how the digital asset has performed recently. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin quickly recovered back towards the $72,400 mark midway through the crash, but the retrace was only temporary, as the coin soon resumed its drawdown and dived under the $67,000 level. Since this low, BTC has made a slight recovery back to $67,600, meaning that it has experienced a decline of almost 7% in the last 24 hours. As is often the case, Ethereum (ETH) and the altcoins have also followed in the lead of the original cryptocurrency, witnessing crashes of their own. With all this sharp price action around the market, forceful closure of contracts, or ‘liquidations,’ are bound to have piled up on the derivative side of the sector. Indeed, data confirms this. Crypto Derivative Market Has Seen $813 Million In Liquidations Today According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivative market has observed total liquidations amounting to a whopping $813 million during the past 24 hours. The table below shows the relevant numbers related to this latest liquidation flush. As displayed above, around $663 million of these liquidations involved long contracts, meaning that this side of the market contributed an overwhelming 81% of the total flush. This lines up with the price action, as assets across the sector have plunged during this period. Mass liquidation events like today’s are popularly known as “squeezes.” In these events, liquidations cascade together like a waterfall and amplify the sharp price move that triggered them. As longs took most of the beating in the latest squeeze, it would be categorized as a “long squeeze.” As for how the various individual symbols contributed to this squeeze, the table below shows the data for this breakdown. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, are number one and two, respectively. Solana (SOL) is the altcoin with the largest amount of liquidations at $41 million. SOL is the only coin among the top assets that has managed strong positive returns during the last 24 hours, and it’s also among the best performers for the past week. This strong performance may be why it has more speculative interest behind it than the other alts right now.",

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Ronaldo Marquez"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against 17 individuals allegedly involved in a Crypto Ponzi scheme that defrauded more than 40,000 victims and amassed $300 million. As per the SEC’s press release, Houston-based CryptoFX LLC operated the scheme, primarily targeting Latino investors in the United States and two other countries. This most recent complaint follows the SEC’s emergency action in September 2022, which shut down the CryptoFX scheme and charged its leaders, Mauricio Chavez and Giorgio Benvenuto. Crypto Ponzi Scheme Targets Latino Community According to Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, CryptoFX operated as a massive Ponzi scheme, enticing Latino investors with promises of financial freedom and guaranteed returns through cryptocurrency and foreign exchange investments. The SEC’s investigation revealed that the scheme relied primarily on funds from new investors to repay earlier investors, with only a fraction of the funds raised being used for actual trading activities. Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said: In the end, the only thing that CryptoFX guaranteed was a trail of thousands upon thousands of victims stretching across ten states and two foreign countries. A scheme of that size requires lots of participants, and as today’s action demonstrates, we will pursue charges against not just the principal architects of these massive schemes, but all those who further their fraud by unlawfully soliciting victims. The complaint alleges that the 17 individuals from Texas, California, Louisiana, Illinois, and Florida served as leaders within the CryptoFX network. They allegedly solicited investors by offering “unrealistic returns” ranging from 15 to 100 percent. Instead of utilizing the funds as promised, the defendants allegedly used them to pay returns to previous investors, provide commissions and bonuses to themselves and others involved, and finance their lifestyles. Defendants Accused Of Defying Court Orders The SEC’s legal action also highlights the involvement of certain defendants in continuing to solicit investments even after court orders were issued to halt the CryptoFX scheme. Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, for instance, are accused of instructing investors to retract their complaints to the SEC to recover their investments. Moreover, Maria Saravia allegedly misinformed investors, claiming the SEC’s lawsuit was fake. The SEC’s complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges various violations against the defendants, including antifraud, securities registration, broker-registration provisions, and whistleblower protection provisions. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties for each defendant. While two defendants, Luis Serrano and Julio Taffinder, have consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations, the court’s approval is pending. Serrano and Taffinder have agreed to pay over $68,000 combined in civil penalties, disgorgement, and interest. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com",

  "author": {
    "name": "Scott Matherson"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is set to once again gain steam as key dates approach. The XRP community will no doubt have their eyes on this one and hope that the lawsuit, which has continued to mar the XRP ecosystem, can well be put in the past. The SEC and Ripple Set For Another Showdown Former Federal Prosecutor James Filan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the SEC’s opening brief is due on March 22, while Ripple will have until April 22 to file its opposition brief. Once that is done, the SEC’s reply brief will follow with the deadline set for May 6. As noted by Filan, these dates form part of the revised schedule for the remedies briefing. The previous deadline for the SEC’s opening brief was set for March 13. However, the Commission made a request to Judge Analisa Torres, seeking a one-week extension and citing “good cause” as the reason why the request should be granted. Judge Torres subsequently granted the request. To avoid prejudice, the SEC also requested that Ripple’s deadline to file its opposition brief be moved from April 12 to April 22 to give the defendants ample time to respond appropriately to the Commission’s brief. This remedies briefing stage is a set-off from the discovery stage, where the regulator had requested certain documents from the crypto firm. These documents, which include post-complaint institutional sales contracts, will form the focal point of the SEC’s opening brief. In it, the Commission will also make certain requests regarding the remedies that should be granted in its favor for Ripple’s breach of securities laws. Judge Torres had previously ruled that the crypto firm’s institutional sales were investment contracts. How The Remedies Briefing Could Go Alongside a monetary fine, the SEC is expected to request an injunction restraining Ripple from conducting institutional sales that are in breach of securities laws. On the other hand, Ripple will most likely contend what amount the Commission requests that it pays as a fine. There might also be contentions from Ripple that its ODL transactions do not classify as securities. Pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton had previously suggested that the remedies briefing might not be so straightforward as both parties might still have to file subsequent briefs. Deaton added that he doesn’t foresee a judgment coming until late summer “at the earliest.” When the judgment is finally given, there is also the likelihood of an appeal from either (or both) parties.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Unlike the rest of the market, Fetch.ai’s (FET) price prevented major losses over the last 24 hours as the altcoin kept its decline limited to 2%. The credit for this goes to the whales who offset the bearish cues. Nevertheless, there is still a threat to the altcoin. Fetch.ai Saved – Whales for the Win The crypto market correction is weighing heavily on all the digital assets, but Fetch.ai’s price somehow did not fall as much. FET only noted a 2% correction throughout the day. However, that does not cover up for the fact that the altcoin could have dropped by over 15%. All thanks to the whales for not letting this happen. The intra-day lows of $2.37 were nearly locked in as trading price before the whales stepped in. The large wallet holders accumulated FET heavily, resulting in the price bouncing back. Addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million FET managed to amass over 18 million FET in two days. This is worth over $50 million, bringing their holdings to 327.81 million FET.

This level is the upper limit of the range in which about 394 million FET tokens worth over $1.1 billion were purchased by investors. Fetch.ai GIOM. Source: IntoTheBlock Thus, Fetch.ai’s price will bounce back from this level should it come across it, as investors will likely keep from booking profits out of fear of losses. FET Price Prediction: Bearish Momentum Is yet to Build Fetch.ai’s price nearly slipped to $2.37 but bounced back to the trading price of $2.80. This establishes the precedent that the bullish steam has not been completely exhausted. The altcoin is still above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is also a positive signal, making FET safe from falling below the $2.46 support floor. Nevertheless, Parabolic SAR, a trend-following indicator that helps traders identify potential reversals in price direction, indicates a downtrend. While the black dots are present above the candlestick, it is not intensive yet. FET/USDT 1-day chart.

Read More: How Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transform Crypto? But, this does not rule out the potential of this trend gaining strength down the line, which could pull Fetch.aiI price down to $2.46.

  "article_type": "article",
  "author": {
    "name": "Bary Rahma"
  },
  "article_detailed_content": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces a potential 50-year prison sentence. Convicted in November for orchestrating what prosecutors have termed one of the “biggest financial frauds in American history,” Bankman-Fried’s downfall is a tale of ambition gone awry, set against the backdrop of the cryptocurrency boom. Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Up to 50 Years in Prison The crux of the prosecution’s argument hinges on Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent activities, which led to the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The jury in a Manhattan federal court found him guilty on all charges, including defrauding investors, customers, and lenders. Thereby, unsettling the once booming crypto market. Prosecutors have painted a damning portrait of Bankman-Fried, describing his recent life as marred by “unmatched greed and hubris.” They argue that his actions were risky and a deliberate ploy to gamble with billions of dollars of other people. Despite the gravity of his actions, Sam Bankman-Fried has refrained from admitting wrongdoing. This is a stance that has only compounded the case against him. “Even now, Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong. His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people’s money,” prosecutors wrote. In contrast, Bankman-Fried’s defense argues for leniency, suggesting a prison term of just over five to six years. They contend that most FTX clients will recover their lost funds and that Bankman-Fried did not intentionally set out to commit fraud.

  "article_detailed_content": "Crafting a compelling pitch for a crypto project is essential in capturing the attention of venture capitalists (VCs), who sift through hundreds of proposals weekly. Still, invaluable insights can be learned into what VCs look for in crypto startups. These include outlining a blueprint for entrepreneurs to refine their approach, focusing on timing, clarity, market understanding, team composition, and community engagement. Building the Perfect Pitch Danilo Carlucci, Founder and CEO of Morningstar Ventures, told BeInCrypto that timing is critical. Startups should engage VCs only when they have a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates their product’s or service’s feasibility and potential. This stage is crucial for eliciting initial interest and feedback from investors. Then, utilizing this feedback to refine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows startups to showcase tangible achievements and metrics, making a stronger case for investment. According to Carlucci, proper timing and iteration of these stages, evidenced by quantifiable success metrics, significantly impact the project’s Future Diluted Valuation (FDV). “Timing is such a difficult thing to get perfect. But if start-ups time their project stages correctly and iterate them, they can raise more funds, ultimately impacting their FDV,” Carlucci said. He also emphasized the importance of clarity and conciseness in pitches. A successful pitch concisely articulates the problem being solved, the uniqueness of the solution, and the strategic use of capital. More importantly, clear go-to-market strategies and user acquisition plans are particularly compelling.

Source: The TIE Projects that distinguish themselves through a well-defined unique selling proposition (USP), backed by thorough market and competitor analysis, stand out. Incorporating on-chain metrics and market trends can further enhance a project’s attractiveness by providing a clear picture of its potential. “We’ve all heard it before. Less is more. As simple as it sounds, we value clear and concise pitches. Keep it short and sweet! Not only do VCs read through hundreds of pitches a week, but I firmly believe that the less time it takes to explain your project, the better it will be,” Carlucci advice. Likewise, Samuel Huber, the CEO of Landvault and the Matera Protocol, told BeInCrypto that startups should pivot their focus toward hard metrics. These include profitability, burn rate, and capital efficiency, which are now paramount to investors. Even with the current enthusiasm in the crypto market, the broader economy will likely continue to adopt a cautious approach. The emphasis on real revenue generation cannot be overstated. In the flux of market cycles, where bull markets often prioritize growth at the expense of solid business foundations, bear markets shift the focus back to fundamental metrics like revenue. “Entrepreneurs should shift their focus towards metrics that investors prioritize. Indeed, crypto startups need to demonstrate their ability to generate real revenue. They must focus on showcasing practical business models rather than solely emphasizing decentralization,” Huber explained. The path to funding is fraught with challenges. “There’s a tightening of funds for startups with unproven business models and poor execution,” Huber noted. He emphasized the importance of demonstrating tangible business metrics over mere projections. This calls for a meticulous focus on building a solid business that stands out in a bear market. Tokenomics and the Dream Team Moreover, the team behind a project is a critical factor for VCs. Carlucci emphasized that VCs invest in people as much as in ideas. Therefore, a team’s track record, complementarity, and vision are scrutinized. The team’s openness to collaboration and feedback and a proactive approach significantly influence a VC’s investment decision. In this regard, most VCs look for teams with a strong track record and extensive experience in their field. “The team is everything! No matter the tech, the design, or the idea, most VCs invest in people; therefore, the team and the vision of the founder is crucial,” Carlucci said. Tokenomics and crypto narrative trends play a crucial role in attracting investment. Projects must design tokenomics that align VCs’ interests with the project’s long-term vision, ensuring a vested interest in the project’s success. Likewise, entrepreneurs must align their projects with prevailing crypto narratives, striving to position themselves as leaders within these spaces. Despite the inherent risks in the crypto industry, Carlucci suggested that a well-articulated USP and comprehensive market analysis can address potential concerns and demonstrate the startup’s awareness of and preparedness for challenges. Meanwhile, Huber highlighted the importance of utility and adaptability. “Generally, projects within infrastructure sectors are highly attractive to investors due to their potential for broader utility. While applications certainly create value, infrastructure projects influenced by narrative trends such as NFTs, the metaverse, DeFi, RWA, or the creator economy offer a foundation that can be leveraged by others, thereby enhancing their resilience,” Huber added. Total Capital Raised by Sector. Source: The TIE Trust is also a critical factor in investment decisions. VCs prefer to back founders they know and trust, reflecting the importance of building a strong company and networking to enhance credibility. In Huber’s view, the journey to securing VC funding in the crypto market is as much about showcasing resilience and innovation as it is about navigating the nuances of investor expectations and market dynamics. Indeed, Carlucci highlighted the importance of selecting the right VC partners. Startups should seek strategic partners offering more than capital, such as user access, networking opportunities, and industry expertise.

This remarkable increase has propelled the crypto asset’s market value to nearly $400 million. The pre-sale for the BOOK OF MEME altcoin began on March 13, allowing participants to send an unspecified amount of Solana (SOL) to a designated address. Solana Meme Coin Skyrockets BOME quickly gained traction within the Sino-British community. The pre-sale garnered an unexpected 10,131 SOL, far surpassing Darkfarms’s 500 to 600 SOL expectations. The overwhelming response led to a subsequent community vote on allocating pre-sale funds. Following the pre-sale, Darkfarms integrated the raised funds into a liquidity pool, setting BOME’s initial price of $0.0000496. Large purchase orders of 100 SOL created a highly liquid market that led to a price peak of $0.0012. This surge later increased the token’s market capitalization to $375 million. Following BOME’s rise, several exchanges, including BitMart and HTX, said they would list the asset. Bitmart later confirmed the primary listing of the altcoin with an initial USDT trading pair. “BitMart is thrilled to announce the primary listing of BOOK OF MEME (BOME) on March 14th, 2024…Deposit feature: Available… Trading Pair: BOME/USDT,” BitMart said.

  "article_detailed_content": "Chainlink’s (LINK) financial trajectory is turning heads, as its Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) revenue has soared by 180% in two months. This surge, driven by the escalating adoption of its multichain bridging platform, positions LINK for a potential climb to the $200 mark. Is Chainlink (LINK) Price Poised for 10X Surge? In a financial upturn, CCIP’s fee revenue leaped from approximately $61,728 in January to an impressive $174,000 in the first half of March. Dune Analytics reports that since its launch in July 2023, the protocol’s total revenue has hit $380,818. Analyzing fee contributions, the Ethereum layer-2 protocol Arbitrum leads at 28%, closely followed by the Base at 24%.

Source: Dune Community ambassador “ChainLinkGod” highlighted that CCIP fees are designed to cover transaction gas costs and pay service providers.

These include partnerships with the Metis layer-2 network, auditing entity Code4rena, stablecoin firm Circle, and a significant alliance with South Korean game developer Wemade. Moreover, the collaboration with SWIFT in 2022 for a token transfer project underscored Chainlink’s expanding influence.

  "article_detailed_content": "PancakeSwap has announced its much-anticipated version 4. This new iteration, PancakeSwap v4, marks a significant advancement, promising enhanced flexibility, functionality, and efficiency. It aims to rectify the limitations of version 3 and redefine the standards for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). What Are the New Features of PancakeSwap V4? According to an announcement shared with BeInCrypto, PancakeSwap v4 is set for a third-quarter release on Ethereum and BNB Chain. It aims to offer a transformative trading experience. With open-source licensing, the DEX plans to foster collaboration and community contribution within the DeFi ecosystem, signaling a leap forward in blockchain technology. “We aim to foster the most comprehensive flexibility and functionality within the Automated Market Maker (AMM) space, built together by the Kitchen (PancakeSwap team) and DeFi developers in the crypto community. Hence, the PancakeSwap v4 code will be released under an open-source license,” Chef Mochi, Head of PancakeSwap, said.” Notably, PancakeSwap v4 introduces hooks. These are external contracts that augment liquidity pool functionalities. Hooks facilitate dynamic fee adjustments, the integration of custom oracles, and more, thereby granting developers unprecedented customization and control. Read more: How To Use PancakeSwap: A Step-By-Step Guide Additionally, the platform supports various pool types, including Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) and Liquidity Book. Moreover, PancakeSwap v4 introduces Flash Accounting. This feature consolidates all pools into a single contract, slashing deployment costs by 99%. It also reduces gas expenses for multi-hop swaps, enhancing the platform’s efficiency and user appeal. In contrast, another DEX leader – Uniswap, integrated similar features earlier this year. This move indicates a broader industry trend towards more flexible and efficient DeFi platforms. However, PancakeSwap’s approach in version 3, which involved forking Uniswap’s code, sparked controversy last year. It highlighted the industry’s struggle with innovation. “We keep up with the latest advancements in the AMM space, alongside a number of our own unique enhancements, to ensure users have access to the best DEX available,” Chef Mochi explained BeInCrypto. Amid these strategic developments, the native token of PancakeSwap, CAKE, shows signs of an impending surge. Technical analysis points to a bullish cup and handle pattern on the weekly charts, suggesting a potential 300% increase to approximately $17. However, this optimistic forecast faces challenges, with resistance anticipated near $9.4-$10. Read more: How To Evaluate DEXs With On-Chain Analytics PancakeSwap (CAKE) Price Performance.

  "article_detailed_content": "Cryptocurrency trading is often viewed with caution due to its volatility and the perceived lack of steady, secure returns. The promise of significant profits exists, but the challenges of fluctuating regulations and the potential for dramatic price changes categorize digital currencies as a high-risk investment. But what if you could mitigate the risk and safeguard your initial capital investment in all market conditions? This is where AlgosOne, a new AI trading algorithm leveraging the latest developments in generative AI, comes in. This regulated AI trading tool not only aims to deliver substantial returns on investments but does so with a commitment to security, aiming to protect the initial capital investment under various market conditions. Remarkably, access to this advanced technology is offered at no cost. Automating Everything One of the main differentiators between AlgosOne and other institutional-calibre artificial intelligence based Bitcoin and Ethereum trading tools is that it is completely hands-off. There’s no coding, strategy formulation, research, analysis, or risk management. AlgosOne picks the asset, position size, trade direction, and entry and exit times. It also automatically implements risk mitigation with stop losses, take profits, hedging, and more. You just sign up, deposit, then sit back and earn a passive profit. Reducing Exposure When Bitcoin, Smart Unidirectional Investment (SUI), or Ethereum trading, you want to safeguard your capital as best as you can. One of the primary ways in which AlgosOne achieves this is by combining the strengths of game-changing machine-learning technology and human experience and expertise. This ensures you are not handing over full control of your crypto to a machine. Professional risk management teams are tracking the market and trading system performance around the clock to shield against instances of flawed data or bias skewing the algorithm’s decision-making and cases of extreme market upheaval that might require human intervention. AlgosOne also protects your capital by adhering to regulatory requirements. Fully licensed and authorised, AlgosOne segregates client and company funds, implements KYC and AML identity verification procedures, and protects against hacks with strict technological security protocols. In compliance with the toughest regulations, it also maintains a reserve fund with a sufficient balance to cover all client account capital in case of a breach, a technical failure, company or market collapse. Adherence to regulation also means accounts are never overleveraged. AlgosOne’s deep-learning capabilities mean that it learns as it goes, improving its ability to optimise risk-adjusted returns with every additional trade, user, and dataset. The algorithm uses a range of different statistically validated techniques and AI-driven investment strategies to automatically mitigate exposure on every trade, including: Offsetting risk with hedging strategies Diversifying portfolios with a range of asset classes Automating stops and limits Avoiding overexposure with caps on trade size Providing compensation for losing trades Generating Profits Let’s face it, the main factor determining your satisfaction with any AI trading tool is its capacity to generate profits, and this is precisely where AlgosOne excels. Obviously, there is no such thing as an investment guarantee or a Bitcoin trading solution that gets it right on every single trade, but over the long run, AlgosOne has proven its ability to hit its targets and offset any short-term losses throughout its trading contracts. For each trading tier, which is based on deposit size, AlgosOne publishes an anticipated profit percentage bracket, which it has consistently been able to meet or exceed, and the profits are far and away the highest offered by any competitor in the space. In addition, the company has just completed a major upgrade, which has involved expanding and diversifying the algorithm’s datasets, as well as improving its ability to detect high-probability opportunities and evaluate risk potential with greater precision while increasing its access to top-quality live data. Eliminating Costs AlgosOne is also guaranteeing that your initial Bitcoin trading investment is protected by means of its fee structure. AlgosOne traders do not pay any subscription, account maintenance, deposit, or transaction fees. With no spreads eating into your principal, all your balance goes towards generating a profit. There is only one fee, a 20% commission, which is only charged on winning trades. The core, original investment isn’t eroded since it only comes out of successful trades. It’s also worth keeping in mind that the money from commissions goes back into safeguarding your capital. Half goes towards platform operations, including 24/7 live support, technical maintenance, and risk management teams, while the other half pays out compensation for losing trades. AlgosOne is offering a highly advanced AI trading tool that mitigates crypto risk and optimizes profits for a rapidly growing global client base. To test drive the system, without funds to a 12-month contract, sign up via the app, any time, for a 2-week commitment-free trial.

  "article_detailed_content": "Recent data from a Paradigm poll reveals that 48% of US crypto owners are leaning towards Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential race, with 39% favoring Joe Biden and 13% still undecided. This is a change from the 2020 election, where 43% of owners recalled voting for Biden and 39% for Trump. How Crypto Could Swing US Elections Around 19% of voters hold or plan to invest in cryptocurrency, and around 11 million registered voters own more than $1000 worth of cryptocurrency. A little over a quarter of undergraduates, who comprised a notable portion of Trump’s voter base in the primaries, also own crypto. Therefore, new and old crypto supporters could be crucial in the 2024 elections. This pivot towards Trump among crypto investors may be due to several factors. The Biden Administration’s regulatory actions against certain crypto companies and activities may have alienated some investors. The US Treasury Department recently chastened crypto exchange Binance for its lax money laundering controls, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto case, Ripple vs SEC, occurred during Biden’s watch.

Source: Paradigm However, former White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci thinks that Joe Biden can impact Bitcoin and financial markets in a more positive way. His upholding traditional hierarchical societal structures is good for crypto, the SkyBridge Capital CEO said. Scaramucci served for 11 days during Trump’s previous term. Trump’s administration’s proposed support for Bitcoin and crypto has been refreshing for US crypto investors, perhaps contributing to the surge in undergraduate constituents. His new sneakers, which could be bought with digital currencies, convinced him of the size of the crypto market. “There has been a lot of use of [Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies] and I’m not sure I want to take them away at this point,” Trump said. Trump has been a notable critic of the Federal Reserve and promised to replace Jerome Powell as Chair. This could suggest a policy shift to more favorable cryptocurrencies. Higher bond yields under Trump’s administration could also make Bitcoin an attractive hedge against economic instability. Read more: What Is Fiat Currency? How Does It Differ From Cryptocurrency? The former US president’s well-documented tirade against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) may also be good for Bitcoin. Trump previously said he would never allow a CBDC if elected president.

  "article_detailed_content": "Dogecoin price has always responded to news of Tesla founder Elon Musk engaging with the meme coin. The same was expected this week. However, the broader market conditions weighed much more heavily on the price action, resulting in DOGE seeing red on the chart. Dogecoin Feigns No More Dogecoin’s price first reacted to Elon Musk in 2021 and has since formed a bond with Tesla’s founder. This bond weakened over the last year as Musk’s interest shifted from DOGE to Artificial Intelligence. However, the DOGE community rejoiced this week as Musk went on to speak in favor of the meme coin. During a session at Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory, Musk stated that Dogecoin would be enabled as a means of payment for Tesla purchases. He went on to call the dog token the “people’s crypto.” Surprisingly, this did not impact the Dogecoin price in any capacity and even failed to prevent a drawdown. DOGE is set to initiate a downtrend owing to the broader market cues. Read More: How To Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) and Everything You Need To Know Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin prices have declined considerably, and Dogecoin prices have followed the same trend. Since the meme coin shares a high correlation of 0.89 with BTC, it was directly influenced. Dogecoin Correlation with Bitcoin. Source: IntoTheBlock Furthermore, the cryptocurrency notes no support from its investors, who have begun falling back as the bullish momentum wanes. The addresses that have been conducting transactions on the network have declined considerably. The bullish community did not contribute to actual activity on-chain, bringing the active addresses down to a four-week low. Dogecoin Active Addresses. Source: Santiment DOGE Price Prediction: A 20% Correction Cannot Be Ruled Out Looking at the daily chart, it can be seen that the Dogecoin price is not too far from beginning a downtrend. The first signal comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It consists of a MACD line (the difference between a short-term and a long-term exponential moving average) and a signal line (a moving average of the MACD line). At the time of writing, these averages are forming a bearish crossover for the first time in a month. Usually, these crossovers are followed by considerable corrections since the market is still cooling down. In the case of DOGE, a fall to $0.147 or $0.134 is possible, marking a 12% or 20% correction, respectively. Read More: Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030 DOGE/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView Nevertheless, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is still positive, sitting underneath the candlestick. If this level continues acting as a support, Dogecoin price could have a shot at recovery, bouncing off $0.164. If DOGE successfully manages to breach through $0.182, the bearish thesis would be invalidated, opening the meme coin up to a rally to $0.20.

  "article_detailed_content": "Marathon Digital Holdings announced on March 15 that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Applied Digital to purchase a 200-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility located in Texas for $87.3 million. \nThe agreement specifies that Marathon will pay the purchase price in cash from its holdings, making the transaction final once all price adjustments are settled.\nPer a post on Marathon Digital’s blog, the acquisition will bring the company’s total Bitcoin (BTC) mining capacity to approximately 1.1 gigawatts of capacity — just shy of the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity needed to power the fictional “Flux Capacitor” from the Back to The Future film franchise.\nFred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, commented:\n“This transaction increases our influence over our current operations, reduces our cost per coin by approximately 20% at the site, and provides us with an additional 100 megawatts of capacity in which to expand. […] Following the close of this transaction and the anticipated expansion of the site this year, our Bitcoin mining portfolio will consist of approximately 1.1 gigawatts of capacity, 54% of which will reside on sites we directly own and operate, and all of which are diversified across eleven sites on three continents.”\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nAs Cointelegraph reported recently, Marathon Digital had its best-performing revenue year in 2023, raking in $387.5 million — up 229% from the previous year and 452% for the fourth quarter.\nThe increase in revenue was attributed to the Bitcoin rally of late 2023 and a 147% increase in Bitcoin production year-over-year for Marathon Digital.\nIn late February, Marathon unveiled a new direct Bitcoin transaction submission service. Called “Slipstream,” the new service was designed and implemented to facilitate and speed up large and/or non-standard transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nNext up, mining companies such as Marathon Digital will have to navigate the impending Bitcoin halving. This event, which will occur once a certain amount of blocks have been mined on the Bitcoin blockchain — currently, it’s anticipated to occur in mid-April — could have an outsized effect on large-scale mining organizations. The rewards for mining a block will be reduced by 50% from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\nRelated: Bitcoin Halving: Latest News, Full Coverage by Cointelegraph\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.\nThe DeFi ecosystem continues to see bullish price action as its total value locked (TVL) breached $100 billion for the first time in over two years, MakerDAO is gearing up for its stablecoin “Endgame” scalability transformation, Ethena becomes the highest-earning decentralized app (DApp), and DeFi platform Unizen will reimburse its users after suffering a multimillion-dollar hack.\nIn other news, BNB Chain has announced its new rollup-as-a-service solution for layer-2 networks.\nMaker’s “Endgame” launch aims for 100 billion DAI to take on Tether\nDecentralized finance protocol MakerDAO is preparing for the launch of its highly anticipated “Endgame” transformation that will focus the platform “toward scalable resilience and sustainable user growth,” according to co-founder Rune Christensen.\nIn March 12 posts on social media platform X and the MakerDAO forum, Christensen proclaimed it was “launch season” for the DeFi lending protocol’s five-phase plan, with the mid-2024 slated Phase 1 involving hiring an external marketing firm to rebrand the entire operation into something less complicated and more fun.\nThe aim of Endgame is to scale the protocol’s Dai (DAI) stablecoin from a $4.5 billion market capitalization to “$100 billion and beyond” in a bid to rival Tether (USDT).\nContinue reading\nDeFi protocol Unizen to provide “immediate reimbursement” after $2.1 million hack\nDeFi protocol Unizen announced that it would reimburse its users who lost $750,000 or less “as soon as humanly possible” after the platform was compromised, which led to the loss of about $2.1 million in user funds.\nOn March 9, blockchain analytics firm PeckShield flagged an “approve issue” with the DeFi platform, reporting that over $2 million had already been drained.\nThe security firm urged users to revoke the approvals from the trade aggregator to avoid further loss. Security company SlowMist estimated the exploit losses to be around $2.1 million and noted that the attacker swapped USDT for DAI.\nEthena becomes the highest-earning DApp in crypto\nEthena has become the highest-earning DApp after breaching $6.8 million in daily cumulative revenue over the past week, according to a March 8 X post by Seraphim Czecker, head of growth at Ethena Labs.\nThe only blockchains surpassing Ethena’s revenue were Tron, at $38.6 million, and Ethereum, at $182.5 million daily cumulative revenue over the past seven days.\nContinue reading\nBNB Chain to expand layer-2 ecosystem with new rollup service\nBNB Chain, the ecosystem powered by the BNB (BNB) token, has unveiled a rollup service solution for building layer-2 blockchains on its network.\nOn March 14, BNB Chain announced its rollup-as-a-service, or RaaS, solution to help projects build layer-2 networks on BNB Chain. The service will give projects access to the tech infrastructure required to deploy layer-2 networks on the blockchain, expanding BNB Chain’s ecosystem.\nContinue reading\nDeFi market overview\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that DeFi’s top 100 tokens by market capitalization had a bullish week, with most trading in the green on the weekly charts.

  "article_detailed_content": "Rumors of a massive Bitcoin (BTC) purchase from the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) are unlikely to materialize, a local financial executive told Cointelegraph. \nThe speculation was spread by Bitcoin enthusiasts on X (formerly Twitter) over the past weeks, suggesting Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund could soon add $500 billion in BTC to its portfolio.\nHowever, the probability of such capital flowing into the cryptocurrency is low, according to financial executive Shadi Qishta, as digital assets are not part of QIA’s strategy.\n“I don’t think it will happen in one way or another any time soon since the QIA has a diverse investment strategy and speeding investments across various asset classes, sectors and geographies to mitigate risk and capture opportunities in different markets and industries.”\nQIA is a sovereign wealth fund, meaning it’s a state-owned investment fund backed by the government. QIA’s investment strategy must be approved by its Board and the Supreme Council for Economic Affairs and Investment (SCEAI), meaning that any revision to its portfolio allocation would go through both bodies. \nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe speculation is also contradicted by previous statements from QIA’s CEO, Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud. “Our team in the technology space is exploring opportunities in the blockchain. This is the space that we’re interested in, not the currency itself,” he reportedly said during Qatar’s Economic Forum in 2022.\nIn addition, no word on cryptocurrencies was heard during Qatar Web Summit’s opening ceremony in February. “Nothing was explicitly mentioned about cryptocurrency investments,” noted Qishta, adding that Abu Dhabi has also announced $100 billion in technology innovation and artificial intelligence investments without including digital assets.\nQatar is among the world’s wealthiest nations, largely due to its vast natural gas and oil reserves. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the country’s total economic output to grow by almost 2% annually until 2025.\nThe nation’s approach toward cryptocurrencies, however, remains restricted. According to Qishta, the local environment for digital assets is still characterized by cautious regulatory oversight and limited to public adoption, as crypto trading was banned in 2018.\n“Despite the global popularity of cryptocurrencies, the adoption in Qatar is relatively low among the general public. Factors contributing to this include regulatory uncertainty, cultural norms, and a preference for traditional banking and investment methods, which are unlike what happened in Dubai,” said Qishta.\nMagazine: ‘Crypto is inevitable’ so we went ‘all in’ — Meet Vance Spencer, permabull\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Radix, the full-stack layer-1 smart contract platform, tightly integrates wallet, programming language, execution environment and consensus algorithm to provide a radically better Web3 and DeFi experience.\nThe world of Web3 has been buzzing over the last few months as Bitcoin has successfully reclaimed its all-time highs (ATHs), with altcoins following not far behind. Many are reporting that this could be the beginning of the 2024 crypto bull market, something completely unfamiliar to speculators as Bitcoin has never reclaimed an ATH prior to its upcoming halving.\nBut, while this market cycle has been different, one thing has remained the same — navigating the Web3 and DeFi ecosystem is still too complex, plagued by hacks and exploits, resulting in a user and developer experience that has left many scarred. Whether their alienation came from blind-signing their assets away to a scammer or a developer's project being exploited due to the complexity of developing in Solidity — a smart contract language — there is a solution, and it's called the Radix Tech Stack.\nOvercoming poor user experience in Web3\nThe Radix Wallet revolutionizes DeFi transactions with its user-friendly design. Thanks to the Radix Transaction Manifest, it offers a clear preview of actions before approval. Designed with a mobile-first approach, it ensures easy and secure smart contract interactions across devices.\nRadix Connect enhances desktop decentralized application (DApp) usage, while Radix Personas empowers users to manage their Web3 identities securely. This wallet is at the forefront of simplifying and securing the crypto user experience.\nRadix Wallet has now seen over 20,000 downloads across iOS and Android and has a strong development roadmap, with new features and improvements being shipped regularly.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nFor Radix, it's not just about ensuring a better user experience; many of the issues with Web3 and DeFi today are spawned from a poor developer experience. Many hacks and exploits can be associated with a Web3 developer having to use coding languages that are far too complex making it easier for exploitable mistakes in the code of their DApps.\nTo solve this issue, Radix developed Radix Engine and Scrypto. The Radix Engine, a cutting-edge alternative to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), together with Scrypto, an innovative programming language, marks a significant leap forward in the DeFi and Web3 spaces.\nUnlike traditional smart contract platforms, where assets are treated as secondary elements, leading to complex and unsafe interactions, Scrypto allows for asset-oriented programming. By drastically reducing the amount of code needed to build applications and making asset interaction intuitive, Radix sets a new standard for secure, efficient, and innovative DApp development, poised to catalyze a new wave of developer adoption and DApp innovation.\n#Breakout2024\nOn March 5, 2024, Radix announced #Breakout2024, releasing a video teasing partnerships, massive liquidity growth, a multimillion-dollar user onboarding campaign, a world record throughput attempt and many more plans for the year ahead.\nPiers Ridyard, CEO of RDX Works, gave clues to breakout DApps joining the network, institutional capital flowing through the Radix DeFi ecosystem, more tier-one exchange listings and, most importantly, a focus on trustless bridging to open up the Radix Network to capital flows from competing chains.\nDeFi liquidity with Project Ignition\nIt's all exciting stuff. The team further conveyed the importance of onboarding more liquidity to Radix with Project Ignition, which went live on March 14 and saw over $7 million of liquidity added to Radix decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in 5 hours.\nProject Ignition, a liquidity incentives campaign worth more than $10 million, is designed to bring more liquidity in the form of USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT), Ether (ETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) onto the network. This will ultimately improve the opportunities for participants in the Radix DeFi ecosystem and the scale at which strategies can be executed.\nProject Ignition also provides significant protection from impermanent loss. If a liquidity provider provides a crypto that outperforms XRD, that liquidity provider is guaranteed up to 4x protection for asset outperformance. That means Ociswap users can generate around 9% yield on your wBTC/XRD liquidity position, plus 23% in SPLASH token, and reclaim any impermanent loss in XRD tokens.\nFollowing Ignition going live, the first perpetual DEX announced its arrival to the Radix ecosystem. The Perpetual DEX called Surge is a collaboration between leading Radix DEX CaviarNine, venture capitalist firm Keyrock and Oracle service Supra. Surge will launch with 100 tradable pairs and will leverage the full Radix technology stack to provide an industry-leading, secure, seamless and streamlined trading experience alongside an intuitive yet powerful liquidity provision system.\nLearn more about Radix\n#Blockchain\n#Cryptocurrencies\n#Smart Contracts\n#DApps\n#Software\n#Developers\n#DeFi\n#Liquidity\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "Internet connectivity in the world’s most populous country is about to become more decentralized thanks to a new decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) innovation. \nOn March 15, internet service provider Wifi Dabba said it would deploy more than 100,000 of its devices — all housed on its DePIN on Solana — to users across India by the end of the year to “connect the unconnected.”\nAccording to Wifi Dabba, despite India’s massive population of 1.43 billion people, the penetration of broadband connectivity is low. It reports only 30 million citizens have regular access to WiFi, with just under 50% having no access of any kind.\nThis upcoming deployment will be the second time the company issues its DePIN-connected devices,  already reporting a steady monthly consumption of 90–100 terabytes of paid data across the already sold devices. \nWifi Dabba said users who own their router hardware can earn the Wifi Dabba token as a reward for the data consumed by hotspot users.\nCointelegraph spoke with the heads of Wifi Dabba to understand why India is the perfect location to deploy DePIN technology for this use case of decentralized internet.\nKaram Lakshman, the CEO of Wifi Dabba, said in addition to the lack of access for many Indians, the dominant major telecom companies focus on urban areas in what he called “tier 1 and 2 cities.”\n“This means it could take several decades to connect the entire country, not factoring in future spikes in data demand,” he said. He also pointed out that India, as the fifth-largest economy and the second-largest holder of crypto, “stands at the forefront of economic growth and technological innovation, underscoring the urgent need for faster infrastructure development.”\nLakshman also highlighted how the scalability of DePIN technology presents a viable solution not only for India but also for other developing nations facing similar connectivity challenges.\n“India serves as a crucial test bed for refining this model, which can subsequently be replicated worldwide to address connectivity issues on a global scale.” \nRelated: Solana needs Firedancer, ‘ChatGPT moment’ to rival ETH, proponents say\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

In 2023, one company tokenized 100 Tesla cars on the blockchain using DePIN technology to democratize and decentralize a ride-sharing initiative in Europe.\nDawn Philip, the communications director for Wifi Dabba, said they anticipate a “significant surge” in the adoption of DePINs and supporting services in 2024, particularly in developing nations.\n“DePINs are poised to find a substantial market fit in these regions, where infrastructure development is needed the most. Unlike the developed world, where infrastructure is largely established, and market saturation is evident, the developing world presents an untapped potential for decentralized networks to flourish.”\nEarlier in 2024, some DeFi executives echoed these sentiments with the addition of artificial intelligence, calling the pair the “power duo” of 2024. \nMagazine: South Africa’s digital-nomad crypto hub: Cape Town, Crypto City Guide\nExchange or buy SOL\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Sustainability is one of the leading issues of the 21st century, and blockchain technology is one of its most significant inventions. Is there a way to leverage blockchain technology in pursuit of sustainability goals?\nJake Campton, communications lead and community advocate at VeChain, breaks this down in episode 51 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast with Elisha Owusu Akyaw. Campton explains how utilizing a Web3 incentive model could guide people toward a more sustainable way of life and highlights the challenges of bringing the two worlds together. \nCampton explains how VeChain has managed to stay relevant across multiple cycles and believes that the growth can be attributed to working on real-world use cases and focusing on securing major partnerships, such as its partnership with Walmart, which has led to over 200 million transactions.\nAccording to Campton, enterprises have a natural appetite to move to blockchain for more efficient data management, instantaneous supply chain tracking and auditing and adopting more sustainable practices. Despite the clear benefits, many enterprises are concerned about integrating blockchain technology because of hurdles like accounting and regulations.\nCampton says: “This is another thing that VeChain has done really well is building solutions that allow the use of blockchain in a commercial environment because, for example, companies don’t want to handle crypto; they don’t want to. It creates a bit of an accounting nightmare, you know, managing crypto assets and especially where the regulations have been so unclear.”\nCampton explains how blockchain technology can contribute to a more sustainable world, a belief that has led to the launch of VeChain’s VeBetterDAO. The new decentralized autonomous organization powers a decentralized application ecosystem that incentivizes sustainable activities like recycling and adopting practices that emit less carbon.\nCampton argues that people need incentives to adopt sustainable practices that can easily be built with blockchain technology, borrowing from various gamification models in the Web3 space.\nA large core developer team is actively working on porting over Ethereum toolkits to make it easier for developers who are used to building in the space to make applications for VeChain. What’s more, the network has created an application that allows users with no coding language to build decentralized applications.\nListen to the full episode of Hashing It Out on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or TuneIn, and remember to check out Cointelegraph’s growing catalog of Web3 podcasts.\nThis article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

On Wednesday, inflows hit $684 million, a 38.3% drop from the March 12. Tuesday saw record-breaking single-day inflows of $1.05 billion.\nBitcoin ETF flow data. Source: BitMEX\nThe total flow of funds into the ETFs stood at $390 million on March 14, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) seeing another $257 million in outflows, bringing net inflows to $132 million. On the same day, the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded inflows of $13.8 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Despite a significant outflow from GBTC, net flows remained positive on Thursday.\nBlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF recorded the largest inflows at $345 million. The cumulative net inflows into the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF remain significant, nearing the $12 billion mark after 44 days of trading.\nThe change in investor sentiment comes amid a broader downturn in the crypto market as the BTC price dropped below $69,000.\nRelated: Bitcoin price nails new $73.6K all-time high as ETFs eat away at supply\nThe impact of declining ETF inflows correlated with fluctuations in the BTC price.

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is calling for a mindset shift toward building layer-2 (L2) decentralized applications and solutions following the successful completion of the Dencun hard fork.\nSpeaking at the ETH Global’s Pragma London event on March 14, Buterin hailed the completion of the network upgrade, which enables L2 rollups to achieve scale by reducing the costs associated with submitting cryptographic proofs to Ethereum’s base layer.\n“We have officially hit basic rollup scaling, but we need to keep in mind that things will be incremental from here,” Buterin told a packed crowd gathered at the Christ Church Spitalfields venue.\nThe event drew over 500 attendees ahead of a weekend-long hackathon and Buterin’s attendance served as a big draw card towards the end of the day’s program of speakers.\nGiven that Dencun hit the mainnet without any hiccups, there was a palpable sense of yearning to hear what is next for Ethereum from arguably its most crucial founding member.\nBlobs are here\nButerin reflected on his widely-cited roadmap for Ethereum following its successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus after The Merge in 2022.\nThe co-founder said that many of the milestones he’d laid out were primarily engineering tasks, some of which came to fruition when Dencun was finalized.\nVitalik Buterin on stage at ETH Global in London in March 2024. Source: Gareth Jenkinson\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nDencun included Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-4844), which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\nEIP-4844 introduced a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing blob space as a replacement for using call data for storage.\nUsing call data to store cryptographic proofs of off-chain bundled transactions has been historically expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely.\nProto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after 18 days.\nEthereum is in a process of change\nEthereum has been in constant flux over the past decade, and Buterin highlighted his belief that its ecosystem needs to change its approach to have a significant impact on the internet and conventional financial systems.\nButerin views the first decade of Ethereum as an inwardly focused period, reflecting on how the ecosystem was developing things for itself:\n“The tech geeks were trying to satisfy tech geeks and create beautiful technology. The second decade needs to see Ethereum breaking out and having a big impact on the world.”\nThe Dencun hard fork has played its part in this narrative, allowing the Ethereum ecosystem to shift away from a layer 1-centric focus. Buterin also expects to see Ethereum’s base layer moving away from a period of rapid change to one more focused on maintenance:\n“We’re on the decelerating side of things. I actually think the biggest changes are behind us, which is amazing.”\nWhile the Ethereum co-founder concedes that L1 changes will continue to be part of the development of the ecosystem, an L2-centric mindset should take hold going forward, focusing on application developers.\nButerin said the ecosystem has created a wealth of tools to build DApps, chief among them being zero-knowledge proofs:\n“They’re able to build applications that are much more scalable and to build applications that do a better job of preserving users’ privacy. And the ease of doing that has increased massively compared to five years ago.”\nButerin also implored builders to adopt an “Ethereum 2.0” approach to development that makes use of contemporary tools and protocols like L2 rollups to tap into improved privacy, security and performance benefits.\nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

The funds were stolen in November from the crypto exchange HTX and its cross-chain bridge HTX Eco Chain, or HECO.\nHot wallets on the HTX exchange were drained for $30 million during an attack on Nov. 22, while the HECO Chain was hacked for $86.6 million on the same day. The funds were swapped to Ether (ETH) through decentralized exchanges and were dormant until this week.\nFlow of funds from HTX/HECO hacks to Tornado Cash. Source: Elliptic\nTornado Cash is a decentralized and noncustodial privacy tool built on the Ethereum blockchain. The crypto mixer uses smart contracts to accept ETH and ERC-20 token deposits from one address and enables them to be withdrawn by a different address.\nThe protocol was sanctioned in August 2022 by the U.S. Treasury Department for its alleged role in allowing the laundering of over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the Lazarus Group.\n“Tornado Cash continues to operate despite sanctions. The mixer operates through smart contracts running on decentralized blockchains, so it cannot be seized and shut down in the same way that centralized mixers such as Sinbad.io have been,” explained Elliptic.\nThe Lazarus Group has apparently switched back to Tornado Cash after losing other mixer options. According to Ellipitc, the hackers chose cross-chain bridges and the Bitcoin (BTC) mixer Sindbad to launder stolen money since the sanctions.\nSindbad, however, was seized by Finnish authorities in November 2023 after U.S. sanctions went into effect, removing another mixing option for the hackers. The U.S. crackdown on crypto mixers also includes the closing of the Blender platform in May 2022.\nAuthorities are also targeting developers of such mixers. Tornado Cash’s developers, Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, have been charged with several crimes by U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The founder of the crypto mixer Bitcoin Fog was convicted of money laundering on March 12 in a similar development.\nMagazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "Crypto investors returned to gains in 2023, pocketing billions in profits during the year after a prolonged downturn, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. \nThe new estimates indicate realized gains — profits from selling assets for more than their purchase price — reached $37.6 billion in 2023, representing a significant recovery from realized losses of $127.1 billion in 2022. Relative to the latest bull market, however, the recovery is modest. In 2021, crypto investors realized gains of $159.7 billion, Chainalysis estimates.\n“Interestingly, our total gains estimate for 2023 is lower than 2021, despite crypto asset prices growing at similar rates in each of those two years. One possible explanation for this could be that investors in 2023 were less likely to convert crypto assets into cash, under the expectation that prices would rise even higher.”\nThroughout 2023, crypto gains were consistent, with only two consecutive months of losses in August and September — when the United States cracked down on crypto companies. Gains soared again in November and December in anticipation of the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nEstimated realized crypto gains. Source: Chainalysis\nThe United States ranked first in the list by a “wide margin” with $9.36 billion in estimated realized gains over the year. The United Kingdom stands second with an estimated $1.39 billion in earned profits. Vietnam, China, Indonesia, India, Russia and South Korea are also among the countries with realized gains of over $1 billion.\n“We also see several upper and lower middle income countries whose residents appear to have achieved outsized gains, especially in Asia — Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India, for example. [...]. We previously noted [...] that countries in these income categories, and lower middle income countries in particular, showed strong cryptocurrency adoption that remained notably resilient even through the recent bear market.”\nAccording to Chainalysis, its methodology measures investors’ crypto gains based on the movements of assets into and out of services that can be converted to fiat currency.\nMagazine: Inside Pink Drainer — Security analyst defends his crypto scam franchise\nGet Access to Real-Time\nTrade Alerts Now\nClick Here For Instant Access\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Services and Privacy Policy",

  "article_detailed_content": "QANplatform’s quantum-resistant technology has been adopted by the first European country, according to a March 14 press release shared with Cointelegraph.\nQANplatform’s technology is used to protect against quantum computing attacks on government-owned cybersecurity infrastructure. The quantum-resistant blockchain enables developers to build smart contracts and applications that are resistant to quantum attacks. The name of the adopting country wasn’t disclosed, due to national security reasons.\nThe integration of the QAN stack will serve as a key component in the country’s post-quantum cybersecurity layer, according to Patrick Storchenegger, the CEO of QAN’s Intellectual property holding company.\n“This will enhance the country’s strategic advantage in navigating the quantum leap by securing its operations.”\nPost-quantum security has seen increased interest since December 2023, when the second-largest quantum processor, IBM Condor, was launched with 1,121 qubits.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nRecognizing the impending threat of quantum computers, the European Commission launched the Quantum Flagship back in 2018, as a research initiative with a budget of at least €1 billion and a duration of 10 years.\nLarge companies are also gearing up for a post-quantum future. Apple unveiled a new update in February that aims to future-proof iMessages with post-quantum cryptography, making Apple the first among a handful of quantum-proof messaging providers. Signal launched a “quantum-resistant” encryption upgrade in September 2023, but Apple says it’s the first to reach “level 3” encryption.\nWhile breaking current messaging encryption models is still considered unfeasible due to the amount of time and computing power required, the advancement of quantum computers will eventually make this possible.\nAccording to Johann Polecsak, the co-founder and CTO of QANplatform, it is important for cybersecurity protocols to stay ahead of the quantum computing curve. Polecsak wrote:\n“We must always be ahead of the curve when it comes to cybersecurity, especially in the era of ‘Store now, decrypt later.’ It is only a matter of time until quantum computers can break today's security algorithms. Recognizing this, we have built QANplatform from the ground up to be immune against quantum computer attacks.”\nQANplatform secured a $15 million investment from MBK Holding in December 2023 and will use the funds to enhance its quantum-resistant technology stack.\nRelated: CoinShares acquires Valkyrie’s ETF business\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission has put cryptocurrency exchange Bybit on its warning list as of March 14. “The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warns the public of an unlicensed virtual asset trading platform (VATP) known as Bybit,” the regulator wrote, “which offers trading services in crypto-related products in a number of jurisdictions.\"\nIncluded in its warning list are 11 products offered by the Bybit exchange, such as Bybit Futures, Bybit Options, Bybit Leveraged Tokens, Dual Assets, Bybit Lending, Bybit Wealth Management and others. “The SFC is concerned that these products have also been offered to Hong Kong investors and wishes to make it clear that no entity in the Bybit group is licensed by or registered with the SFC to conduct any ‘regulated activity’ in Hong Kong,” said the regulator.\nCurrently, crypto-related products may constitute futures contracts or securities and require prior licensing with the SFC before they can be offered to Hong Kong residents. The March 14 warning refers to bybit.com and its Seychelles-registered owner Bybit Fintech Limited, which is different than bybit.com.hk, a similar domain owned by Spark Fintech Limited that does not currently provide crypto services in Hong Kong.\nOn Feb. 1, Cointelegraph reported that Bybit was seeking a virtual asset trading operator (VATP) license in Hong Kong through its Spark Fintech Limited subsidiary. Only two crypto exchanges in Hong Kong are licensed by the SFC, including the OSL exchange, which received a license on Dec. 15, 2020, and HashKey Exchange, which was licensed on Nov. 9, 2022.\nThe deadline for crypto exchanges operating in Hong Kong to file for a VATP application lapsed on Feb. 29. Unlicensed firms must cease operations in the special administrative region by May 31. Likewise, exchanges whose VATP applications are rejected by the SFC must also leave the city within three months. \nRelated: Hong Kong begins Phase 2 of CBDC pilot\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

  "article_detailed_content": "Human identity project Worldcoin has obtained a third-party audit of its Orb software, according to a draft of a March 14 report from the development team seen by Cointelegraph. The audit was performed by Trail of Bits, which claimed to have found no vulnerabilities that “can be directly exploited in relation to the Project Goals as described,” the report stated. The full Trail of Bits report is expected to be published on March 14, according to an emailed statement from Worldcoin.\nWorldcoin allows people to verify their humanity by registering with a phone number or email address or by having their iris scanned by an Orb device. When a user performs this registration, they obtain a “World ID” that can be used to prove they are an actual human. The project was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Altman claimed that he helped to create Worldcoin out of fear that artificial intelligence (AI) bots may soon be able to pose as humans effectively.\nSource: Worldcoin on X\nPrivacy advocates have criticized Worldcoin on the grounds that it risks leaking users’ iris scans to hackers or governments. These iris scans could potentially be used to reveal all of the activity a person performs with their World ID.\nRelated: Spanish court denies Worldcoin’s injunction request against regulator\nAccording to the report from Worldcoin, Trail of Bits began its assessment on Aug. 14, 2023. The security firm was given version 3.1.10, which was “frozen” for assessment purposes on July 8, 2023. The current version is 4.0.34, the report stated.\nThe auditors reportedly spent six weeks investigating the code for any potential vulnerabilities. They considered several attack vectors that a hacker could use to obtain a user’s iris scan but ultimately concluded that “our analysis did not uncover vulnerabilities in the Orb’s code that can be directly exploited in relation to the Project Goals as described.” Specifically, the auditors concluded that an attacker could not obtain the user’s iris code unless the attacker has control of one of the trusted certificates. They reportedly stated:\n“We believe the iris code is not written to persistent storage on the Orb and that it is included only in a single request to the Orb’s back end [...] [W]hile this configuration can be improved to make it more secure (TOB-ORB-10), it should not be possible for typical attackers to extract the iris code from the Orb’s network traffic; the attacker would have to be in control of one of the trusted certificates.”\nAccording to the report, the auditors did make two recommendations to improve the Orb’s security. The first was to “harden” the configuration for the signup flow to ensure that future changes do not introduce security issues. The second was to replace the ZBar library used to scan QR codes during signup with a pure Rust version. The auditors claimed that ZBar might have “memory safety” issues that could leak configuration data, such as the user’s “data custody choice,” if this change was not made. The Worldcoin team implemented both of the suggested changes, the report stated.\nThe debate over Worldcoin’s privacy practices may continue for some time. On March 6, Spain’s Agency for the Protection of Data issued an injunction against the project, claiming that the agency needed time to investigate claims that Worldcoin violated data protection laws. In response, Worldcoin claimed that it did not violate these laws and that the Spanish government was “circumventing EU law” by issuing the injunction.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

Baby Boomers responded with an 85% concerned sentiment, Generation X at 77%, Millennials at 74%, and the tech-native Generation Z at 68%. \nWhile data and privacy concerns are not new in an industry in which users must hand over sensitive information daily to carry out digital activities, this year ushers in even more reasons for users to think twice.

  "article_detailed_content": "The crypto industry is transitioning to DeFi and noncustodial platforms. Dyor, a decentralized crypto exchange, wants to get a role in this change by driving financial interactions with a commitment to community-driven growth.\nFollowing the collapse of FTX, formerly the third largest crypto exchange, investor interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and noncustodial finance began to increase. Supporting this trend, a report highlighted that 40% of crypto trading platforms have started using decentralized technology and that retail demand is higher than institutions.\nDespite the rising popularity of noncustodial alternatives, the transition to Web3 and DeFi comes with a learning curve, as noncustodial platforms lack user-friendly tools for investment. Addressing adoption challenges, some initiatives are trying to position noncustodial platforms as a compelling alternative to traditional finance by improving access and usability.\nManaging crypto investments with ease\nDyor, a decentralized investment platform, provides a simple, transparent and noncustodial alternative for investors turning to DeFi from the chaos of traditional crypto exchanges. Opening its doors to experienced investors and newcomers to the crypto space, Dyor intends to become an accessible hub for online investing.\nAvailable on both iOS and Android, Dyor integrates features designed to enhance the user's investing experience, such as wallet swaps, bridging, asset management and tracking.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Dyor embraces a community-centric approach, allowing users to create profiles to share trades, token purchases, market opinions and crypto-related insights through their \"All Things Crypto\" feed. In addition to user-generated content, the feed aggregates news from 129 sources, providing a market view.\nDyor is exploring integrations with platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Discord, and other social media channels to further enhance its news aggregation capabilities.\nFollow-trading and social investing\nDyor is a social investment platform where community engagement and capital meet. Through the Dyor app, investors have the opportunity to connect, drawing on mutual experiences for more advantageous deals. Users can access the follow-trading feature, where they can imitate the actions of experienced investors, and the social investing model, where investments are made in line with a specific goal.\nWith minimal steps, users are able to discover new tokens and benefit from Dyor's live price alerts, access to market news and ease of integration.

Engaging with other participants, taking part in events, participating in competitions and completing milestones awards users the platform's native token. Users can also receive token rebates from the trading volume generated by the users they bring into the platform.\nDemocratizing in decentralized crypto exchanges\nMarkuss Jonans, CEO of Dyor, emphasized the importance they attach to simplicity and social interaction. Underlining their priority on exploration, he added:\n“We aspire to be the app where users navigate the intricate landscape of allocating their capital on-chain, identify which tokens to acquire and discern the narratives that captivate and stand out the most.”\nJonans underscored that they initially estimated the number of users would be less than 100,000 and said that the waiting list on their website has already collected over 450,000 registrations. The interest beyond expectations shows the potential of noncustodial alternatives to traditional finance solutions.\nReflecting on the advancements and community-driven approach of platforms like Dyor, it's evident that user-friendly, secure and inclusive financial platforms will continue to shape the future of investing.

Opinions in the crypto community vary, with some supporting the government’s actions while others disagree.\nIn interviews with Cointelegraph, local crypto stakeholders shared their opinions about the situation. Crypto analyst Rume Ophi said that the government was well within its rights, as requests like this are always made when the government is trying to investigate national security matters.\nHowever, Ophi’s opinion doesn’t sit well with that of other local crypto enthusiasts who took to X to express their disagreement. Chukwumaeze Dike, a crypto enthusiast and cybersecurity specialist, said he finds the request for the top 100 users surprising and doubts Binance will comply.\nScreenshot of Binance’s Government Law Enforcement Request System.

In addition to that, Nigerian authorities have requested that Binance turn in its transaction history for the past six months.\nNathaniel Luz, the CEO of Flincap — a liquidity platform for crypto exchanges — said that the Nigerian authorities are likely requesting the list of the top 100 Nigerian peer-to-peer traders on Binance to ascertain if there has been any market manipulation of the Nigerian naira/United States dollar exchange rate on the platform. This information will also contain the trades done by these individuals.\nBayo Onanuga, the presidential adviser on information and strategy, argued that Binance and other crypto platforms manipulated the naira and triggered a massive decline in the local fiat currency. The official also suggested banning platforms like Binance in the country.\nNigeria has emerged as one of the fastest-growing crypto economies in the world in the past few years. It is also the second-biggest economy in the world in terms of crypto adoption in 2023. In August 2022, Nigeria was named the most crypto-obsessed country in the world by the number of Google searches for “cryptocurrency” or “buy crypto.”\nMagazine: Bitcoin hits new highs, SEC delays options decision, and stablecoin bill looms: Hodler’s Digest, March 3-9\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "BNB Chain, the ecosystem powered by the BNB (BNB) token, has unveiled a rollup service solution for building layer-2 blockchains on its network. \nOn March 14, BNB Chain announced its rollup-as-a-service (RaaS) solution to help projects build layer-2 networks on BNB Chain. The service will give projects access to the tech infrastructure required to deploy layer-2 networks on the blockchain, expanding BNB Chain’s ecosystem.\nBNB Chain also explained that the service supports decentralized applications (DApps). This allows a wide range of project verticals, including blockchain gaming or decentralized finance, to be deployed on the layer-2 networks. In addition, BNB Chain is also providing rollup management support and a “no-code” deployment option for projects that might not be familiar with coding.\nThe BNB Chain team explained that the layer-2 networks established through BNB Chain’s RaaS service will be built on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), which they described as their “foundational layer-1 blockchain and governance chain.”\nAccording to the BNB Chain core development team, the new service follows its goal of supporting the mass adoption of Web3 technology. They said:\n“By combining the power of RaaS and the interconnectivity capabilities of our ecosystem, developers will have a comprehensive toolkit to build efficient and scalable layer-2s on BSC.”\nBNB Chain has been pouring its efforts into layer-2 networks since 2023. On June 20, 2023, it unveiled its layer-2 scaling solution opBNB — based on the Optimism OP Stack — on a testnet. The layer-2 solution is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, which means it works with Ethereum-based smart contracts and token standards.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

BNB Chain reported that the platform handled more than 35 million transactions and 150 DApps deployed on its testnet run. The project also claimed that the opBNB platform hit 4,000 transactions per second (TPS) on a stress test.\nBNB Chain’s 2024 Outlook released in January. Source: BNB Chain\nAccording to BNB Chain, the new rollup service is part of its efforts to reach the goals it set earlier this year. On Jan. 31, the firm released its “BNB Chain 2024 Outlook,” which introduces the “One BNB” interconnectivity concept that links BSC and its decentralized storage service, BNB Greenfield.\nMagazine: Here’s how Ethereum’s ZK-rollups can become interoperable\nExchange or buy BNB\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethereum layer-2 (L2) protocols have seen a significant drop in transaction fees, with some protocols recording a reduction of up to 99% after the Dencun upgrade on Ethereum on March 13. Dencun is a scalability-focused upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet, with many touting it as one of the most significant upgrades since the Merge.\nMedian transaction fee of L2s. Source: Dune\nStarknet, a prominent Ethereum-based L2, has seen a 99% reduction in gas fees since the upgrade. The protocol shared a screenshot of its latest gas fee, which has come down to $0.04 compared to over $6 prior to the Dencun upgrade.\nStarknet gas fee. Source: Starknet on X\nSeveral other L2 platforms, including Optimism, Base and Zora OP mainnet, registered a dramatic decline in gas fees after the Dencun upgrade. The average transaction fees for Optimism dropped to $0.05, $0.064 on Base, $0.5 on Arbitrum and $0.16 on zkSync Era. Within 24 hours of the upgrade, Optimism and chains based on Optimism’s tech stack, like Base, have seen the most critical gas fee reductions.\nOptimism L2s transaction cost decline. Source: Optimism on X\nOne of the most widely used L2 platforms, Arbitrum One, plans to launch its ArbOS upgrade to introduce blob support to Arbitrum rollup chains later today.\nThe Dencun hard fork introduced nine different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), with EIP-484 introducing data blobs and providing L2s with a new transaction data type called blobs. The latest data blobs bypass the traditional “call data” process to publish information on the Ethereum mainnet, providing faster transactions at lower fees. The Dencun upgrade was two years in the making.\nRelated: CoinShares acquires Valkyrie’s ETF business\nThe Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko called Dencun “the most complex fork we’ve shipped since the Merge” and ties with Byzantium for the “most total EIPs in a fork.” \nScalability and low gas fees were the top goals of the latest Ethereum upgrade. Early indications suggest that the hard fork has helped several L2s cut transaction costs. Experts believe Dencun might be a temporary solution, but it won’t be enough to help scale the Ethereum network.\nAs the number of rollups using blobs rises and the battle for blob space is predicted to heat up, the low cost of L2 chains using blobs may see increased fees in the future, resulting in higher transaction costs.\nExchange or buy ETH\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "The European Union (EU) financial regulators want to add more stablecoin regulation guidelines under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework by publishing draft regulatory standards for issuers of stablecoins when dealing with complaints.\nThe Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) issued protocols on March 13 for efficiently and equitably resolving complaints by asset reference token (ART) holders. These guidelines detail the procedures and standards for stablecoin issuers to effectively manage complaints.\nThe European Banking Authority (EBA) document said:\n“Such a framework should support innovation and fair competition while ensuring a high level of protection of retail holders and the integrity of markets in crypto assets.”\nAccording to the EBA report, this regulatory framework for stablecoins is the outcome of a joint collaboration between the EBA and the EU’s markets regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Both entities conducted the consultations between July and October 2023.\nScreenshot of the EBA announcement of the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under MiCA regulations. Source: The European Banking Authority on X\nThis regulatory framework is due for submission to the European Commission for approval by the end of June. Subsequently, these standards will undergo review by the European Parliament and the European Council before being published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the bloc’s authoritative repository of existing laws.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nRelated: EU banking authority extends Anti-Money Laundering guidance to crypto\nThe MiCA regulatory framework within the bloc categorizes stablecoins that can be linked to multiple fiat currencies or other assets, including cryptocurrencies, as ARTs. This is distinct from stablecoins solely pegged to the value of a single currency, like the euro or dollar.\nPrior to this, the EU had been actively monitoring stablecoins through the MiCA regulation. The push for stablecoin oversight became imperative after the collapse of Terra’s UST, which raised concerns about their systemic implications. Independently, the EBA had previously suggested regulations for stablecoin issuers.\nAnother provision within the MiCA legislation also mandates rigorous screening of shareholders and board members for crypto asset service providers (CASPs). These rules seek to authorize CASPs while ensuring the separation of customer assets and trading. The goal is to avoid the comingling of customer and company money, as in the case of FTX.\nThe full implementation of MiCA is anticipated by December, while the stablecoin regulation is slated for launch in the summer. The MiCA legislation seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for crypto issuers, service providers and users.\nMagazine: Hodler’s Digest, Jan. 7–13: Venezuela shuts down Petro, SEC’s X account hacked, Bitcoin ETFs go live\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

The metric primarily deals with recording economic transactions between residents and non-residents.\nAndorra — a country best known for its ski resorts and tax-haven status — required technical assistance on 56 topics, one of which was its inability to record cryptocurrency transactions. In response, the IMF report stated:\n“The (IMF) mission explained the current guidance on the recording of Bitcoin-type crypto assets as well as how it will change in the next generation of the international standards.”\nThe country’s financial regulator, the Andorran Financial Authority (AFA), told the IMF that banks in Andorra need prior approval for recording Bitcoin and crypto asset transactions. However, no banks have requested the approval yet.\nIMF’s technical recommendation to Andorra. Source: imf.org\nThe IMF further recommended that the AFA oversee the monitoring of transactions and positions of crypto assets until September 2024. The IMF’s recommendation to monitor crypto assets was given medium priority. Andorra will be able to use the information to compile its macroeconomic statistics.\nRelated: IMF working paper proposes country-level assessment matrix for crypto risks\nA recent IMF study found that digital currencies can help Pacific Island countries (PICs) meet their unique currency needs.

However, the IMF said that developing a regional approach to digital money would help mitigate problems such as scalability restraints and economic volatility.\n“Some PICs are more prone to currency substitution by crypto assets and stablecoins due to weak confidence in their domestic monetary systems and the absence of other publicly supported digital assets such as CBDCs [central bank digital currencies].”\nIn general, the report leaned toward slow, deliberate action on digital currency while urging the island nations to hold off on their plans to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC), citing its unpreparedness.\nMagazine: Zhu Su pumps Milady to $19K, Alchemy Pay crypto bank, HK tokens: Asia Express\nExchange or buy BTC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Source: Dan Cline on X\nUploading the Bee Movie script is a long-running joke in and outside crypto circles, which usually involves a race to mint the full-length script on brand-new networks and blockchain-related functions. The trend originates from a larger Bee Movie meme which involves posting the full-length script wherever possible across social media. \nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

The transaction cost a total of $13.88, according to data from Etherscan. \nAlso referred to as EIP-4844 or “proto-danksharding,” blobs were introduced as a core feature of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade in a bid to reduce transaction costs on layer-2 networks by a significant margin.\nAlongside several other improvements, the Dencun upgrade allows for layer 2s to use blobs instead of a calldata function for temporarily storing data while executing transactions, resulting in cheaper end costs for users.\nCline’s Bee Movie script will only exist on the Ethereum network for another few weeks, as Blobs are “pruned” after approximately 18 days — the amount of time required for a layer 2 to retrieve the data contained within.\nMason Hall, an engineer and investment partner at crypto venture capital firm a16z reported doing the same thing less than an hour later, reporting it cost him $5 to execute.\nHall said he also uploaded the bee movie script using blobs. Source: Mason Hall on X\nAt the time of publication, three Ethereum layer-2 networks — Starknet, ZkSync, Optimism and Base — have implemented blobs on their networks, per Dune Analytics data.\nIn a March 14 post to X, Base lead developer Jesse Pollak announced that the integration of blobs on the Base network had seen transaction fees fall from around $0.31 to near-zero.\nPollak says blobs have seen transaction fees on Base reduced to near-zero. Source: Jesse Pollak on X\nRelated: Industry veterans share praise, skepticism, as Ethereum Dencun upgrade goes live\nOver 2,000 blobs have been posted on Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, with Starknet accounting for 74% of all blobs submitted since the Dencun upgrade was rolled out on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13.\nOutside of EIP-4844, the Dencun upgrade incorporates another eight EIPs designed to improve a wide array of functions on the network, including consensus, execution, and data costs.\nThis includes EIP-1153, which introduces a “transient storage” system to further reduce fees, as well as EIP-4788, which increases transparency by storing the root of each Beacon Chain block in a smart contract that can be queried by applications.\nDevelopers expect the data provided by EIP-4788 to be used in new features for bridges and staking pools.\nThe reduction in fees on swaps and transactions on Ethereum layer 2s will only kick in once the networks begin integrating EIP-4844 on the networks.\nAt the time of publication, swap fees on the largest layer-2 network, Arbitrum, are still running around $1.16, while swap fees on Polygon stand at $1.46, per L2 Fees data.\nIs measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

  "article_detailed_content": "Layer-2 blockchain network Arbitrum is looking to shore up its Web3 gaming development arm. A March 12 post on the official forum announced the launch of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), a project requesting 200 million ARB tokens for developer onboarding and gaming development. \nAccording to the post, the goal of the GCP is to develop a long-term gaming ecosystem on the Arbitrum network:\n“We are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a two year period to bolster the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape. The GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to mature into a longer-term gaming program with a more comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.”\nAs of the time of this article’s publication, 200 million ARB is worth approximately $426 million. The funds would be partially used for coinvesting in promising studios and games for development on the platform, according to the forum post.\nThe project also shared its key productivity indicators and estimates, a list that includes establishing Arbitrum as “the de facto leader for on-chain gaming.”\nOther goals include taking 200 to 300 applications for builders, having 20% or more of all Web3 games select Arbitrum as their base network, 25 new Orbit launches, and more net migrations to Arbitrum versus other layer-2 networks.\nThe proposal also says that, if approved, 40 million ARB would be allocated for infrastructure bounties. These would be paid out on a “per proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum.”\nThe timing of the GCP launch and proposal comes just three days ahead of a scheduled ARB token unlock. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Arbitrum will unlock 673.5 million tokens (worth around $1.34 billion at current prices) for its team and advisers as part of a March 16 “cliff unlock” of about 1.1 billion tokens.\nRelated: CCP reveals game world details and playtest dates for new blockchain game set in Eve universe\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest NFT headlines.

Signups for the closed beta are currently live as of the time of this article’s publication.\nThe posts also gave the first glimpse at details surrounding the game world and its lore. Per CCP, Project Awakening will be a single-shard survival experience — meaning gamers won’t be split across instances. It’s set in “the dark expanse of space where civilization has decayed in the ruin of its own ambition.” The gameplay will purportedly revolve around survival, rebuilding a “broken world” and combat.\nProject Awakening will have some form of blockchain gaming built into it, according to CCP. However, it remains unclear exactly what this will look like at launch.\nPer a CCP blog post:\n“CCP Games is creating a persistent world bound by digital physics, where composability and programmability will enable players to build and collaborate on top, outside of and within the emergent game environment - unlocking boundless creativity for third-party development via blockchain technology and cryptography.”\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nIt’s possible this could indicate that the game might support some form of digital asset or real estate ownership or other form of blockchain-based commoditization, but so far, details are scarce.\nAnother March 13 blog post appears to have been written from the perspective of one of the game’s nonplayer characters. It’s evidently meant to lay out some of the game’s lore.\nHowever, with lines such as “too long the gate network hasn’t carried thinking meat through its veins,” it’s more of an interesting teaser of what’s to come than an informative view into the game world itself.\nCointelegraph reached out to the company for further details concerning the hackathon and what testers can expect. CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson told Cointelegraph:\n“Playtesters will be building on top of the Carbon Development Platform, using the game’s systems to create new features and functionality within the game world. Familiarity with the Solidity programming language will be useful, but not a requirement. Our first hackathon last year shaped our understanding of the platform’s potential, and with the upcoming hackathon, we expect an escalation of creativity and ingenuity from the community.”\nPétursson also said the company didn’t have a launch window to share yet.\nRelated: Web3 gaming gets new launch platform aimed at developers and gamers\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest NFT headlines.

The platform allows for the secure and effortless exchange of data and assets across diverse networks.\nSeamless Web3 integration\nEntangle’s infrastructure introduces simplified scalability to the Web3 ecosystem through three foundational components: the Photon Messaging Protocol, Universal Data Feeds and Liquid Vaults.\nThe Photon Messaging Protocol offers a secure and customizable communication layer for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM networks. The protocol ensures the security of data transmission while providing flexibility in the adjustment of consensus parameters and key settings. It enables various use cases, such as managing omnichain assets, facilitating cross-chain swaps and establishing trustless bridges.\nUniversal Data Feeds — a novel approach to blockchain oracle services — enhances data processing efficiency by incorporating embedded logic, enabling applications to operate more dynamically and responsively within the Web3 ecosystem. This infrastructure paves the way for diverse use cases, ranging from real-world assets (RWAs) and omnichain GameFi applications to asset pricing, loan collateralization and the native application of Liquid Vaults.\nLiquid Vaults, as the name suggests, seeks to enhance liquidity within the Web3 space. Users can create Composable Derivatives Tokens (CDTs) based on yield-bearing assets, augmenting liquidity and optimizing returns.

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethereum’s much-anticipated Dencun upgrade, which allows for the reduction of gas fees on layer-2 solutions through proto-danksharding, went live on March 13, drawing both applause and doubts from speculators. \n“I don’t think this upgrade will significantly impact ETH’s price in the short term,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at crypto wallet provider YouHodler, told Cointegraph. “But we may notice an increase in activity on the blockchain. At the same time, I expect ETH’s price to grow in the long term because the upgrade will make ETH much more valuable in the growing competition of new innovative layer 1 blockchain projects.”\nBut for Mara Schmiedt, CEO of liquid staking development firm Alluvial, the implications of the Dencun upgrade are bullish, even in the short term. “In light of Bitcoin’s recent institutional surge enabled by recent ETF spot market approvals and total value locked in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem close to scratching the $100 billion mark, this scalability-focused upgrade is much anticipated,” Schmiedt told Cointelegraph, adding: “Ethereum has faced scalability issues that have acted as a blocker to mainstream adoption and accommodating the growing number of users and transactions.”\nFor Onno Sterk, chief operating officer of crypto exchange OSL, the Duncun upgrade is nothing short of significant, as it allows Ethereum to fix critical issues that have hindered the network’s development for years. “The digital asset space, while revolutionary, has been marred by issues of high transaction fees and limited scalability,” Sterk told Cointelegraph. “These challenges have not only stifled innovation but also restricted the wider adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors.” He further stated:\n“At its core, the Dencun upgrade is centered around proto-danksharding, an innovative approach aimed at drastically reducing transaction fees while simultaneously increasing the network’s processing speed. This development is monumental, as it enables Ethereum to serve as an effective database for other blockchains, thereby facilitating a more interconnected and efficient digital asset ecosystem.”\nOver the past year, Ether (ETH) has seen a 141% return due to a combination of Dencun upgrade optimism, speculation on the approval of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and a broader crypto market recovery, although the asset has somewhat underperformed Bitcoin’s (BTC) 198% return during the same period. Although crypto enthusiasts are anticipating a favorable decision on Ether ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in May, not all share the sentiment.\n“From my viewpoint, the SEC will use any excuse to postpone the decision,” said Lienkha, “which is why I am not expecting approvals this spring. However, I think the probability of a final positive decision is quite high.” \nRecently, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, also warned that the odds of an Ether ETF approval in May are not as rosy as one may expect. \nMeanwhile, Alluvial’s Schmiedt emphasized that in order for Ethereum to reach meaningful adoption, “institutional adoption, widespread accessibility, and clear regulatory frameworks” are all necessary factors. “The success of Ethereum relies on the active participation of its community members, and I‘d encourage everyone — whether you are a developer, user or investor — to continue contributing your expertise and perspective to help shape the future of Ethereum,” she stated.\nRelated: Dencun upgrade goes live on Ethereum mainnet\nExchange or buy ETH\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Finding ERC-20 token balances in any given wallet is simple; when users open their wallets, they automatically display the balances of all the imported tokens. However, when an individual or an entity, such as law enforcement or a business, needs to ascertain the ERC-20 token balances of another address, direct access to the wallet is not possible.\nIn such cases, an application programming interface (API) can be used to check the balances in a wallet. An API would return all ERC-20 token balances owned by an address and could automate the process of checking token balances.\nThis article discusses how one can use the APIs of Chainbase, Alchemy and Moralis to get information about ERC-20 tokens owned by an address.\nStep-by-step guide to using Chainbase to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address\nChainbase — a Web3 blockchain interaction layer infrastructure — offers API services to help developers quickly access and utilize blockchain networks. Its APIs facilitate on-chain data queries.\nTo work with Chainbase, a user needs an account on the platform with an API key, an integrated development environment and a wallet address as input.\nStep 1: Create a free account and log in\nRegister a free account on Chainbase and get access to different APIs and its data cloud. Then log into Chainbase and visit the dashboard. Initiate a new project within the console and obtain an API key.\nStep 2: Use Chainbase API to write script\nThe next is to make an API call to Chainbase to retrieve ERC-20 token balances. The examples below use Javascript. The subsequent action entails executing a HTTP request with JavaScript, utilizing the Axios library to obtain ERC-20 token balances from Chainbase.\nUse “fetch” to make a HTTP request to retrieve data from a server, as shown in the code snippet below:\nThe code in the above example queries Chainbase to fetch the first five ERC-20 token balances of a wallet (using Vitalik Buterin’s address as an example) on the Ethereum mainnet, displaying the results or any errors encountered.\nWhile the native Fetch API is a common way to perform HTTP requests with JavaScript, in the example code, “fetching” is conceptually done by Axios, not by the native Fetch API. To use Axios, the user must install it using “npm install axios --save” in the terminal.\nThe above code uses Axios in JavaScript to query Chainbase for the first five ERC-20 token balances of Vitalik Buterin’s wallet on the Ethereum mainnet.\nStep 3: Print the token balances\nThe getAccountTokens API of Chainbase uses the chain ID and wallet address as parameters and returns all ERC-20 token balances the wallet owns. Users can also find information about a specific token by populating the “contract_address” field. To get data printed, the user must run the command “node .js” in the terminal.\nThe above code snippet displays balances and information for several ERC-20 tokens, including Eterium, Uniswap V2, dYdX and others, from a given wallet.\nStep-by-step guide to using Alchemy to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address\nAlchemy offers APIs that work as a platform layer, reading or writing to the blockchain and delivering the precise information developers want. The following is the procedure to get token balances via Alchemy:\nStep 1: Install Node and the NPM\nInstall Node and the Node Package Manager (NPM) on the local machine. Node is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment, while the NPM provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.\nStep 2: Sign up for an Alchemy account and create an app\nOn the Alchemy website, sign up for a free account. Then, sign in and navigate to the “Alchemy Dashboard” to create a new app. Set the blockchain to “Ethereum” and the network to “Mainnet.” Click on the app’s “View Key” button on the dashboard and note the HTTP URL and API key.\nThe URL will be in this form: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxx\nStep 3: Create a Node project\nThe next step involves initializing an empty repository and installing the required Node.js dependencies. For API interactions, particularly with the token API, users need to use the Alchemy software development kit (SDK), though Axios or Fetch could serve as suitable alternatives.\nAxios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from nodes. Fetch API is a built-in module in Node that facilitates making API requests and handling responses on the server. The Alchemy SDK is a program function library that supports access to the underlying data model and technologies.\nThe code is under-given:\nThe code will create a repository “eth-balance,” which holds all the files and dependencies, and the code will be written in the “main.js” file.\nStep 4: Get the token balances of an address\nTo retrieve token balances, users may utilize the getTokenBalances method, which requires a single argument: the wallet address for which the token balances are desired. Then, a user needs to add the following code to the main.js file.\nUse the following command to run the script:\nThe output will be displayed as follows:\nThe above code displays the token balances for the wallet at address 0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045, listing each token by its contract address along with the respective balance in hexadecimal format.\nHowever, the output of the previous step — which lists token contract addresses and balances in the smallest units — is not easy to understand. To obtain detailed token information like name, symbol and decimal count, users should use the getTokenMetadata method. This function — requiring the contract address as input — delivers data in a structured format.\nMoreover, users can refine their script to integrate the getTokenBalances with the getTokenMetadata method. For instance, they can eliminate zero-balance tokens and convert token balances into human-readable forms.\nStep-by-step guide to using Moralis to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address\nMoralis has enterprise-grade Web3 APIs, facilitating the integration of Web3 in any tech stack. The following is the process for using Moralis to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address:\nStep 1: Set up Moralis\nInstall Node.js v14+ and NPM. Unpack the binary to the installation folder and set the system environment variable for Node. Command npm-install sets up an NPM package and any other packages that it might depend on.\nCreate a free Moralis account, log in to the Moralis dashboard and get the API key. Users can find it in Settings > Secrets. Here, users should locate the “Web3 API Key - Default” or a similarly named key and copy its value for use in their projects.\nStep 2: Find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address\nMoralis provides a “getWalletTokenBalances” endpoint to find all ERC-20 tokens owned by an address. It requires two parameters: address and chain. In this context, address represents the specific wallet address being queried for token balances. Chain indicates the particular blockchain network, such as Ethereum, on which those tokens are held.\nHere is the Javascript code to use:\nThe above code initializes the Moralis SDK, sets it up with a provided API key, and then queries for all ERC-20 token balances associated with a specified Ethereum wallet address, printing the results in a JSON format to the console.\nStep 3: Run the script\nNow, users can run the script and find the number of tokens. In JavaScript, users need to enter the following command:\nThe terminal will display the below JSON response:\nThe JSON snippet above details the holdings of ERC-20 tokens in a specific blockchain wallet featuring two tokens: ApeCoin (APE) and Wrapped Ether (WETH). It includes essential information like the contract addresses, names, symbols, logo URLs (when available), decimal precision, and the balances of the tokens within the wallet, expressed in the smallest denomination of each token.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

  "article_detailed_content": "Recently launched decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) io.net is set to onboard Apple silicon chip hardware for its artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services.\nIo.net has developed a Solana-based decentralized network that sources graphics processing unit (GPU) computing power from geographically diverse data centers, cryptocurrency miners and decentralized storage providers to power ML and AI computing.\nThe company announced the launch of its beta platform during the Solana Breakpoint conference in Amsterdam in November 2023, which coincided with a newly formed partnership with Render Network.\nIo.net claims its latest upgrade makes the platform the first cloud service to support Apple silicon chip clustering for machine learning applications. Engineers can cluster Apple chips for ML and AI computing from anywhere worldwide.\nRelated: ‘107,000 GPUs on the waitlist’ — Io.net beta launch attracts data centers, GPU clusters\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored in depth, io.net provides low-cost GPU computing resources for AI and ML use cases. The platform uses Solana’s blockchain to facilitate payments to GPU and central processing unit computing providers.\nAccording to io.net’s chief operating officer, Tory Green, Solana’s infrastructure is uniquely suited to meet the scale of transactions and inferences io.net will facilitate. The infrastructure sources GPU computing power in clusters, which involves thousands of inferences and associated microtransactions to use the hardware.\nThe upgrade allows io.net users to provide compute power from a range of Apple Silicon chips. This wide range includes the M1, M1 Max, M1 Pro, M1 Ultra; M2, M2 Max, M2 Pro, M2 Ultra; and M3, M3 Max and M3 Pro models.\nThe M3 chip family is built on contemporary three-nanometer process technology, which Apple touts as next-generation GPU architecture. Source: Apple\nIo.net notes that Apple’s M3 chips’ 128-megabyte memory architecture surpasses the capabilities of Nvidia’s flagship A100-80 gigabyte graphics cards. Io.net also notes that Apple’s M3 chips are powered by an enhanced neural engine 60% faster than its M1 series.\nRelated: Cloud-based app taps into Solana to bring life to old devices\nIts unified memory architecture also makes the chips suited for model inference, running live data through an AI model to make predictions or solve tasks. Io.net founder Ahmad Shadid said the addition of Apple chip support could help hardware meet the growing demand for AI and ML computing resources:\n“This is a massive step forward in democratizing access to powerful computing resources, and paves the way for millions of Apple users to earn rewards for contributing to the AI revolution.”\nThe addition of Apple hardware support allows millions of Apple product users to contribute spare chip and computing resources for AI and ML use cases.\nMagazine: Real AI use cases in crypto: Crypto-based AI markets, and AI financial analysis\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

  "article_detailed_content": "The founder of Bitcoin Fog, a massive $400 million crypto-mixing service, was convicted of money laundering in a United States District Court on Tuesday, March 12 — the latest win in the government’s crackdown on crypto mixers and their founders. \nRoman Sterlingov, 35, was found guilty of money laundering, money laundering conspiracy, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violations of the D.C. Money Transmitters Act.\nSterlingov, however, had argued throughout the trial that he was only a user of the service, and not its operator. His attorney, Tok Ekeland said in a March 12 X post that his team will appeal the verdict. \nAccording to evidence presented at the trial, Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog from October 2011 to April 2021, which acted as a money laundering service for “criminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement.”\nSource: FBI Washington Field on X \nThe service moved over 1.2 million Bitcoin (BTC) over the decade-long operation — worth $400 million at the time of the transactions — with the bulk of cryptocurrency coming from darknet marketplaces tied to narcotics, computer fraud abuse and identity theft, the government said. Bitcoin Fog also served distributors of child sexual abuse material. \nEvidence used to convict Sterlingov found that the “vast majority” of crypto deposited to his crypto exchange accounts came from “Bitcoin clusters” associated with Bitcoin Fog.\n“Evidence presented at trial clearly showed that the defendant laundered hundreds of millions of illicit funds from the dark web through Bitcoin Fog in an attempt to conceal the origin of those funds,” said Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Chief Jim Lee.\nActing Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division also stated that the division is “committed to unmasking and prosecuting those who use technology to hide their crimes, no matter how sophisticated the scheme may be.”\nJ.W. Verret, a professional witness in the case, has also pledged to help Sterlingov’s appeal. Verret has long argued that the on-chain forensics used to accuse Sterlingov is flawed.\nSource: @llamaonthebrink on X\n“The trial lasted four weeks. I testified for a full day and I worked on the case for a year,” said Verret, adding: \n“The verdict, issued March 12, was ‘guilty.’ They say it four times as the four counts of the indictment are read. It felt like I was punched in the stomach. The only way my brain can process it is to focus on strategies for appeal.”\nThe jury has granted forfeiture of assets seized from the crypto mixer, which includes 1,354 BTC held in a Bitcoin Fog wallet and nearly $350,000 in various cryptocurrencies held in a seized Kraken account.\nThe most serious charges — money laundering conspiracy and money laundering sting — each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the other two charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Sentencing is set for July 15.\nRelated: Over $300M in stolen crypto assets reached Bitcoin mixers in 2023\nAnother crypto mixer founder is set to face trial later this year.\nRoman Storm, the co-founder of controversial cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash which was sanctioned in August 2022, is set to face a criminal trial in September.\nThe Tornado Cash co-founder faces three charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nMagazine: Zhu Su pumps Milady to $19K, Alchemy Pay crypto bank, HK tokens: Asia Express\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

The pilot test included 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, three exchanges and the stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust.\nIn its announcement the same day, the Canton Network said that 155 participants from 45 major organizations have since demonstrated settlement across 22 permissioned blockchains connected to its ledger. The firm stated: \n“Over a four-day period, participants were invited to try 22 dApps comprising five fund registries, five cash registries, three bond registries, three trading, four margin, and two financing apps, to exchange tokenized securities, money market funds, and deposits across applications.”\nThe Canton Network is a privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network designed for institutional investors. In part, the blockchain allows financial institutions to move regulated assets, data and cash between each other in real time. \n“With the Canton Network, a digital bond and a digital payment can be composed across two separate applications into a single atomic transaction, guaranteeing simultaneous exchange without operational risk,” according to a press release from Canton. It added, “Likewise, a digital asset could be used in a collateralized financial transaction via connection to a repo or leveraged loan application.”\nCurrent participants of the Canton Network include Deloitte, Deutsche Börse, Microsoft, Moody’s and S&P Global. \nOver the past year, tokenization has garnered significant interest from institutional investors and celebrities alike. On Feb. 7, the Hong Kong subsidiary of Swiss multinational bank UBS tokenized an options call warrant of Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi’s stock on Ethereum together with local crypto exchange OSL. A few weeks later, Argentine soccer legend Lionel Messi announced the release of a tokenized product in partnership with Join The Planet, an environmental nonprofit organization behind the PLANET token. \nRelated: Insurance, agriculture, real estate: How asset tokenization is reshaping the status quo\nExchange or buy USDP\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "An old vulnerability in the Trust Wallet iOS app may still affect individuals who created accounts with it — even if they no longer use Trust Wallet — according to a recent report from security researchers at SECBIT Labs. The vulnerability only existed from Feb. 5 through Aug. 21, 2018 and does not affect accounts created after that time period, the researchers stated. However, some users may be unaware that the vulnerability existed and may still be planning to use the exposed wallets.\nThe vulnerability was caused by two functions called by the Trust wallet in a Trezor library that were supposed to only be used for testing. Yet despite developer notes warning developers against their use, Trust Wallet accidentally included these functions in its iPhone wallet app, SECBIT claimed. This error allegedly allowed attackers to guess the private keys of some users and steal their funds. According to SECBIT, these accounts are still vulnerable even now.\nThis newly revealed vulnerability is allegedly separate and distinct from Trust Wallet’s browser extension flaw, which the Trezor team already acknowledged in April 2023.\nIn a Feb. 15 blog post responding to SECBIT’s claims, Trust Wallet stated that the vulnerability only affected a few thousand users, who were all notified and migrated to new wallets. Trust Wallet claimed that it patched the vulnerability in July 2018 and that its app is currently safe to use.\nPost regarding the vulnerability. Source: @ErrNil on X\nSECBIT finds vulnerability in Trust Wallet iOS app\nThe research team said it ran across the flaw while investigating a widespread attack on crypto wallets that occurred on July 12, 2023 that affected over 200 cryptocurrency accounts. Many of the accounts attacked had not been used for months or were stored on devices with no internet access, which should have made them extremely difficult to hack. In addition, the victims used many different wallet apps, with Trust Wallet and Klever Wallet being the most commonly used. This made the causes of the hack difficult to pinpoint, which piqued the curiosity of the researchers.\nUpon further investigation, the researchers discovered that most of the victims’ addresses had first received funds between July and August 2018. However, their investigation came to a dead end shortly after this discovery, and they moved on to other research.\nThen, on Aug. 7, 2023, the Distrust cybersecurity team announced that it had allegedly discovered a vulnerability in the Libbitcoin Explorer Bitcoin (BTC) app. Called “Milk Sad,” this Libbitcoin vulnerability allowed attackers to guess users’ private keys. After reading about this alleged flaw, the SECBIT team began to suspect that a similar flaw may have caused the July 12 attack.\nThe researchers reopened the investigation and began looking through versions of the Trust Wallet code published from July through August 2018. They discovered that the iOS versions of the app from this period used functions “random32()” and “random_buffer()” from Trezor’s crypto iOS library to generate mnemonic phrases.\nThese functions had developer notes warning against their use in production apps. For example, the notes for random32() stated, “The following code is not supposed to be used in a production environment. [...] It’s only included to make the library testable. [...] The message above tries to prevent any accidental use outside of the test environment.”\nTrezor source code containing warning. Source: SECBIT Labs\nAfter investigating the code, the researchers allegedly discovered that it generated seed words that were not random enough to prevent them from being guessed by an attacker. This meant that any Trust Wallet account generated on an iOS device during this time was at risk of being drained, SECBIT claimed.\nRelated: US investigates Trust Wallet iOS app for vulnerability\nIn its report, SECBIT claimed to have generated a database of compromised addresses, which it then forwarded to the Trust Wallet team. It also claimed to have compared these addresses with the victims of the July 12 hack and found that 83% of the victims had wallets generated using the random32() and random_buffer() functions.\nWhen Trust Wallet was confronted with this information, it allegedly told SECBIT it had already notified users privately in 2018. It also emphasized that the addresses had balances of zero and, therefore, could not be warned against losing funds. SECBIT alleged it urged Trust Wallet to publicly announce the vulnerability but that Trust Wallet did not comply. The firm says it published its findings only after Trust Wallet failed to make this public disclosure.\nDespite its critical report, SECBIT pointed out that Trust Wallet is open-source, so some other wallet developer may have forked the code and caused its users to generate vulnerable addresses, or another wallet developer may have independently made the same mistake as Trust Wallet by using the Trezor crypto iOS library from this period to generate addresses. Researchers opined: \n“Of course, the Trust Wallet may not be the only one who misused the trezor-crypto library. There may be many other unknown projects that have similar vulnerabilities. Someone could even blame the trezor-crypto library for quietly changing to an insecure default implementation, causing fatal flaws in projects that use it as an underlying dependency.”\nAccording to SECBIT, Trezor updated its library on July 16, 2018, adding production-ready versions of the two functions. Even so, the vulnerability may still affect some users who created accounts in early 2018 but have never sent funds to them, the researchers claimed.\nTrust Wallet’s response\nCointelegraph reached out to Trust Wallet for comment. In response, a representative pointed to the team’s Feb. 15 public statement about the issue. In this statement, the development team emphasized that the current version of Trust Wallet does not contain the vulnerability.\n“We want to assure Trust Wallet users that their funds are safe and the wallets are safe to use,” the spokesperson stated. “Though there was a previous vulnerability in our open-source code in early 2018 affecting a few thousand users only,” they continued, “the vulnerability was quickly patched with the support of the security community — and affected users were notified and migrated into safe wallets.”\nTrust Wallet pushed back against claims that it had not adequately informed users. “Trust Wallet’s founder took swift and proactive steps to inform all impacted users and provided them with a secure migration path,” said the spokesperson, “ensuring no user was left vulnerable.”\nTrust Wallet also denied that most of the hacks were against accounts its app generated. Only “600 addresses out of the 2,000s hacked” were found in its user database, implying that most victims were not Trust Wallet users. Of these 600 users, some of them could have imported their addresses from another app, Trust Wallet claimed.\nIn contrast to SECBIT’s statement that 83% of the victim addresses were produced by the flawed code, Trust Wallet stated that “only one-third of them have the 2018 Trust Wallet historical vulnerability.” In its report, the team encouraged security researchers to make use of its bug bounty program and claimed that it is committed to keeping its wallet secure.\nRelated: Trust is the best strategy in crypto bear market — Trust Wallet CEO\nIn a July 12, 2023 report, the Klever wallet also confirmed that some of the victims of the attack had used its app. However, it claimed that all of the addresses had been imported and were not originally created by Klever.\nCointelegraph reached out to Trezor for comment. In response, the firm’s chief technology officer, Tomáš Sušánka, emphasized that the function at the core of the controversy was solely meant for testing and not for official project development use: \n“[The function is] exactly as described in the source code, the function is not meant to be used in a production environment, and we provide explicit warnings of this. The function is replaced with a secure RNG on the Trezor itself. This function is meant solely for testing. We love open-source, but it is unrealistic to expect us to prevent any possible misuse of the many projects we have open-sourced. These projects are provided as is, without any warranties, as their licenses clearly depict.”\nIn SECBIT’s report, researchers warned iOS users with Trust Wallet accounts from this time period to migrate to new wallets and stop using the old ones. “It’s alarming that users may still use wallets created during the vulnerable period,” they stated. “Without awareness of the issue, they may face further loss of funds.”\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

  "article_detailed_content": "Layer-2 scaling protocol Starknet aims to double the impact of lowered costs for rollups after Ethereum’s latest hard fork, Dencun, takes effect on March 13.\nThe Starknet Foundation announced the rollout of additional fee-saving initiatives on its protocol that will coincide with the Dencun upgrade. The hard fork is arguably the most significant upgrade to Ethereum’s protocol since its shift to proof-of-stake consensus in October 2022.\nDencun includes Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP-4844), which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\nRelated: Make Ethereum cheap again: ‘Blobs’ to be launched via Dencun upgrade on March 13\nEIP-4844 creates a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing blob space as a replacement for using call data for storage. Using call data to store cryptographic proofs of off-chain bundled transactions has been historically expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely.\nProto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after a fixed period of 18 days.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nPolygon Labs’ vice president of product, David Silverman, previously told Cointelegraph that the blog space is drastically cheaper for rollups and provides the same security guarantees.\nStarknet expects immediate reduction in fees\nEcosystem developers anticipate that there might be a delay in the realization of the fee reductions by layer-2s in the coming weeks as rollups carry out governance and upgrade procedures to change their contracts — moving from pointing to call data to point to the new blob space.\nThe Starknet Foundation has announced a hard fork dedicated upgrade set to coincide with Dencun. Starknet version 0.13.1 will transition away from the “expensive” call data method for sending data to Ethereum to the more cost-effective “blobs” transaction type, significantly reducing fees.\nThe layer 2 expects to benefit significantly due to the fact that call data accounts for nearly 90% of the gas fees Starknet pays to post transactions to the Ethereum mainnet.\nRelated: More TPS, less gas: Ethereum L2 Starknet outlines performance upgrades\nStarkWare product manager and blockchain researcher Ilia Volokh tells Cointelegraph that Starknet’s shared prover (SHARP), which sends Starknet’s state diffs to Ethereum as call data, will shift to blob space. State diffs contain information about every contract storage that was updated and additional information on contract deployments.\nVolokh expects to see accurate statistics reflecting fee reduction within an hour of Dencun’s implementation. Meanwhile, the full benefits will be immediately reflected to users, Volokh said:\n“A byte of data will be priced in accordance with Ethereum’s blob prices.”\nStarknet’s SHARP prover makes use of recursive proof technology that essentially bundles previous proofs into batches called trains. A new hash system introduced in early 2024 will allow the trains to increase the amount of transactions they can carry and ramp up the protocol’s efficiency.\nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

  "article_detailed_content": "In the world of cryptocurrencies, digital asset protection is critical. By transferring one’s cryptocurrency holdings from an exchange to a hardware wallet like the Ledger wallet, one may take ownership of their private keys and improve security. This article explains how to safely move one’s Bitcoin holdings from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano X device. \nUnderstanding the crypto migration process\nTransferring digital assets from an exchange-controlled environment to a personal storage device (self-custodial) where users can maintain control over their private keys is the process of migrating Bitcoin (BTC) from an exchange to a Ledger hardware wallet.\nThe need for hardware wallets\nDespite their ease of use, cryptocurrency exchanges fall short of the security and control offered by hardware wallets such as the Ledger Nano X. Exchanges are prone to hacking, putting assets at risk. In contrast, the Ledger Nano X protects cryptocurrencies offline from internet threats and gives users complete control over their private keys, which improves financial independence.\nPrerequisites for crypto migration to Ledger Nano X\nStep 1: Configure and update the Ledger Nano X\nMake sure the Ledger Nano X is running the latest firmware update before starting the migration. This is essential for security features and compatibility with the newest coins. To finish any available updates, Ledger Nano X has to be connected to a personal computer; open the Ledger Live program and follow the on-screen instructions.\nStep 2: Installing cryptocurrency applications\nInstall the applications for the coins you want to move using the Ledger Live program. Ledger Live is compatible with many digital assets; you must install the appropriate apps on your smartphone to manage these assets.\nStep 3: Safeguard the secure passphrase word\nYou will receive a recovery phrase when you set up your Ledger Nano X. Keep this phrase safe since it is a backup key for all your cryptocurrency holdings. Write the recovery phrase on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere secure. Never input this phrase on any website or distribute it to anyone.\nSteps to linking Coinbase Wallet to Ledger device\nFollow the steps below to connect the Coinbase Wallet to the Ledger device:\nStep 1: Download and install the Coinbase Wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store.\nStep 2: Launch the Coinbase Wallet extension.\nStep 3: Choose “I already have a wallet” if you have one; otherwise, select “Create new wallet.”\nStep 4: Select “Connect Ledger wallet” to link your Coinbase Wallet.\nStep 5: The following window will display connected or paired devices. Select yours and click “Connect now.”\nStep 6: Sign the message to link the Ledger device to the Coinbase Wallet.\nStep 7: After signing the message, a popup saying “Your device is ready” will appear.\nStep 8: Open the extension to see your assets.\nStep 9: All the assets owned will be shown in the wallet.\nSteps to migrate crypto from Coinbase to Ledger Nano X\nFollow the few easy steps to successfully migrate from Coinbase to Ledger Nano X.\nStep 1: Access your Coinbase account\nVisit Coinbase.com and sign in using your personal credentials.\nStep 2: Initiate the transfer\nLocate the “Send/Receive” menu or “Portfolio” section on the Coinbase dashboard. This is usually at the top right corner of the interface.\nStep 3: Select the cryptocurrency to transfer\nClick on the “Send/Receive” button, which will prompt a box to appear. In the “Send” tab, select the cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) you wish to transfer to your Ledger Nano X from the provided dropdown menu.\nStep 4: Enter the amount\nEnter the amount of cryptocurrency you wish to transfer to your Ledger Nano X.\nStep 5: Enter your Ledger Nano X address\nLaunch the Ledger Live application on your computer and navigate to the account linked to the cryptocurrency you want to transfer to your Ledger Nano X address.\nThe Ledger wallet address will appear on the device screen when you select “Receive” and follow the on-screen instructions. You must ensure that the address displayed in the Ledger Live application matches the address shown on your device.\nCopy the address from Ledger Live and paste it into the Coinbase “Recipient” field after verifying it. You must also confirm the address is correct to avoid losing funds.\nPlease note that creating a Ledger deposit address is now necessary. Coinbase often matches the address to the appropriate network automatically. However, users should confirm the appropriate network.\nDeposit addresses can be generated via the Ledger Live app without a Ledger device; however, these unverified addresses may lack security. Utilizing such addresses is done at the individual’s own risk.\nStep 6: Finalize and confirm the transfer\nVerify that all the information is correct before completing the transfer by carefully reviewing the transaction details, including the recipient’s address and the amount of cryptocurrency.\nCoinbase might ask for further verification after you click the “Continue” button, like a 2-factor authentication code. After verifying everything, choose “Send Now” to transfer the cryptocurrency from your Coinbase account to your Ledger Nano X.\nThe load on the blockchain network and the related transaction fees affect how long it takes for a transaction to be confirmed. The Ledger Live app and users’ Coinbase accounts let them keep an eye on the transaction. Once the transaction is successfully confirmed, the transferred amount will be reflected in their Ledger Nano X account.\nProtecting cryptocurrency assets with Ledger Nano X\nSecuring cryptocurrency involves more than just transferring assets to a Ledger Nano X; it also requires understanding and adhering to best practices for hardware wallet security.\nKey measures to ensure crypto asset security after migration\nFollowing a successful cryptocurrency transfer from Coinbase to a Ledger Nano X, immediate steps should be taken to secure the holdings. The protection of these investments largely depends on the digital security practices employed and the physical safeguarding of the Ledger device.\nPhysical protection of the Ledger Nano X\nOne should treat their Ledger Nano X as they would a significant amount of cash or a valuable piece of jewelry, storing it securely in a locked safe or drawer. Despite the device’s PIN protection, restricting physical access adds an extra layer of security.\nRegular firmware and app updates\nLedger constantly aims to improve the security and functionality of its devices through firmware updates. Owners should frequently connect their Ledger Nano X to the Ledger Live software to perform these updates. Additionally, updating each cryptocurrency app on the device ensures access to the latest features and security enhancements.\nSecure the recovery phrase\nThe importance of the recovery phrase cannot be overstated. This 24-word phrase is crucial for accessing cryptocurrency holdings and can restore accounts on a new device if the original Ledger device is lost, stolen or damaged. Storing this phrase in a secure location, such as a fireproof safe, and considering a durable backup solution like the Ledger Cryptosteel, is advisable.\nPractice safe transaction habits\nOne should always double-check addresses before confirming transactions and remain vigilant against phishing attempts. Remember, Ledger will never request one’s 24-word recovery phrase. Users should also familiarize themselves with common scams and phishing tactics in the crypto space, which is essential to avoid falling prey to them.\nNavigating transaction delays and network selection\nEnsuring network compatibility between the exchange and the Ledger Nano X poses a common challenge during the migration of cryptocurrency, especially with multi-blockchain currencies like Tether (USDT). It’s crucial to select the correct network on both Coinbase and Ledger to prevent asset loss during transfers.\nAdditionally, blockchain congestion can lead to transaction delays, where patience becomes vital. Instead of resending the transaction immediately, monitoring its progress through blockchain explorers may prevent transactions from getting stuck twice. Overcoming these challenges not only smooths the migration process but also secures the digital assets when transferred from Coinbase to Ledger Nano X.\nBy migrating cryptocurrency from an exchange to a Ledger Nano X, individuals can ensure the long-term security of their assets. Being informed about the migration process, addressing potential challenges and employing strategies to maximize security is essential. It’s important to remember that securing cryptocurrency is an ongoing process that demands vigilance, education and adaptability to new threats and technological changes.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

Transactions can take minutes to complete and cost users substantial fees, sometimes 10s or even hundreds of dollars. This hinders the user experience and limits the network’s ability to handle the ever-growing demand for real-world applications.\nTo address Ethereum’s scaling challenges, developers have created layer-2 solutions. These solutions can be considered “new lanes” on the Ethereum highway for collective vehicles.\nOn Metis, transactions are bundled together and processed quickly and cheaply without compromising the security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. Layer-2 solutions like Metis take transactions off the main Ethereum network, decongesting it and allowing for faster and cheaper transactions.\nBut isn’t there already a bunch of L2s?\nWhile L2s already exist, Metis tries to level up by focusing on scalability and prioritizing decentralization, meaning a robust network less prone to censorship and downtime. Many existing layer-2 solutions prioritize speed and cost reduction, though these often come at the expense of some degree of decentralization.\nDecentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology, which ensures that no single entity controls the network, creating an environment more resistant to censorship and manipulation. A genuinely decentralized layer-2 solution would inherit these benefits from the underlying Ethereum blockchain while also offering scalability.\nIf successful, Metis can solve the scalability blockchain trilemma and contribute to a thriving decentralized finance ecosystem.\nTo learn more about Metis and how it could revolutionize the future of blockchain technology, listen to the full episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph on Cointelegraph’s podcast page, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or your podcast platform of choice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Gaming has been a catalyst in resurrecting Web3 from a year-long winter. It’s also a key force for mass adoption. Yet, the journey towards fully realizing the potential of Web3 gaming is fraught with challenges, notably the seamless integration of on-chain elements without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and player empowerment.\nNew users should only experience friction if necessary, and as late as possible. That’s not the case with most existing Web3 games. From connecting their wallets upfront to signing transactions for verification, users face multiple hurdles before actually trying the game. These frictions contrast starkly with the vision of a seamless and accessible gaming world that fully on-chain gaming aspires to achieve.\nTitles such as Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, though groundbreaking, fall short of being fully on-chain. Fully on-chain games store all game assets, mechanics, and states on the blockchain. This radical approach ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and player control, allowing for a truly decentralized gaming experience where players own and shape their digital destinies.\nRelated: Axie Infinity is toxic for crypto gaming\nBuilding the best game demands a functional, efficient combination of on-chain elements and the rich user experience of legacy titles.\nHolding Web3 games to Web2 standards is comparing apples to oranges. Their requirements, value propositions, and scopes differ greatly despite serving similar audiences.\nWeb3 games are meant to solve age-old problems like top-down models, lack of user control, and strong-arming by gaming corporations. That’ll happen only by implementing alternative models, processes, and principles — not by emulating the outcomes achieved in Web2.\nWe can even argue that terms like “engaging,” “seamless,” and “hassle-free,” will take on new meanings in this context, enhanced by other aspects like community orientation, real in-game value, and user-generated logic.\nTherefore, when building Web3 games, the most crucial requirement is to address novel challenges, ideally involving embracing innovative technologies and models that align with the principles of autonomy and community governance. It’s about building “Autonomous Worlds” (AWs), a concept introduced in 2022 by Ludens — the founder of Lattice.xyz — to describe “a world with a blockchain substrate.”\nMoreover, new-age games must nurture and serve the expanding community of problem-aware gamers. Those who seek genuine solutions to the odds stacked against them in legacy gaming. Not mere bounty hunters and fleeting profit-mongers.\nBuilding fully on-chain games\nIronically, Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties served as pivotal catalysts in the evolution of blockchain gaming — but they weren't fully on-chain. They were experimental, niche, and heavily crypto-centric, characterized by their clunky user interfaces. Despite opening up new avenues, they weren’t entirely \"Autonomous Worlds\" either. Users had little or no control over the rules and direction of the game, and only parts of the game states were on-chain.\nneed help my ship is stuck in the ░F░O░G░ pic.twitter.com/Hn6jn3NTOK\n— The Citadel (@0xCitadel) March 6, 2024\nDark Forest was the first decentralized real-time strategy game, released in 2020. Using zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs), a cryptographic protocol, to create a “fog of war” in the gaming experience, this project set an example in building incomplete information games on-chain. For reference, think of games like poker, where players only see their hands and don’t know what cards others have.\nThe challenge Dark Forest tackled was maintaining a publicly accessible distributed ledger without compromising the confidentiality of players' strategies — a fundamental aspect in any strategic gameplay.\nUsing zkProofs, Dark Forest maintained gameplay integrity and player privacy on a blockchain. This approach solved the critical issue of revealing sensitive game states (e.g., planet locations or attack trajectories), which is easily manageable with centralized servers but very challenging in decentralized environments. Dark Forest's solution set a precedent for real-time strategy gaming on the blockchain, providing a blueprint for future on-chain game development.\nThey even sparked the proliferation of community-oriented, bottom-up AWs: Mithraeum, Citadel, ZkHunt, and so on. Loot Project was another interesting addition to this space, letting users permissionlessly expand the IP and spawning hundreds of games, lores, etc.\nMithraeum. Source: Screenshot\nBy putting everything on-chain — from game states (assets, actions, etc.) to logic (rules of introduction, mechanisms for in-game interactions, etc.), AWs unlock flexible and resilient digital realities where users come of their own.\nGoing beyond in-game asset ownership, they incentivize players to attach greater significance to their on-chain gaming activities. More importantly, on-chain logic provides gamers with a meaningful say in what’s legitimate and what’s not in the game-world.\nThis is a massive departure from the status quo, where end-users are mostly passive consumers, playing at the whims and mercy of corporate publishers. Rules and norms emerge via community consensus, not the arbitrary will of external entities. And they serve grassroots interests. Players can build, contribute, monetize, and participate in ways that are impossible in Web2 games.\nRelated: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs\nThe empowering, skin-in-the-game nature of AWs instills a stronger desire for mastery in gamers. They’re more driven to find creative solutions to solve problems and create mods and plugins to establish entirely separate economies within the game. This participatory fosters a deeper connection to the game, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration within the community. For example, Dark Forest players have built a range of bots, plugins, and custom clients they can use to climb a leaderboard.\nAs we look to the future, the journey towards fully on-chain gaming is not without its challenges, yet the promise it holds is immense. By redefining engagement, ownership, and control within the digital realm, on-chain gaming is poised to offer experiences that more closely mirror real-world interactions and relationships. In doing so, it not only enhances the richness of virtual worlds but also establishes a new standard for what gaming can be—truly immersive, empowering, and reflective of the players' desires and aspirations.\nThe principles of decentralization, player sovereignty, and community collaboration will be the guiding lights, shaping the future of gaming into an inclusive, democratic, and exciting digital frontier.\nFelix Xu is a co-founder and CEO of ARPA.

  "article_detailed_content": "Bank customers and the United States economy could lose opportunities if a poor approach is taken to regulating blockchain technology, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) vice chair Travis Hill told an audience at the Mercatus Center think tank on March 11. The United States is already at risk, Hill said, and the FDIC shares the blame for that.\nTokenization of bank deposits and other real-world assets (RWA) could make it possible to carry out financial transaction at any time with real-time settlement, Hill said. In addition, it would provide programmability of payments, making it possible to conduct intraday repurchase (repo) exchanges and improve settlement times for some bond issuances and numerous other transactions. Consumers could also benefit from using programmable payments in place of escrow.\nAmong the many open questions about tokenization, Hill mentioned the use, or not, of unified ledgers, blockchain interoperability and ownership rights as assets move along the blockchain. Furthermore:\n“Global standards are being established, directly or indirectly, and with many non-U.S. jurisdictions actively engaged in this area, the United States risks ceding influence at this critical stage.”\nProgrammability could reduce settlement risks and Know Your Customer processes, but it could also allow consumers to move their assets quickly, aggravating bank runs. An “off” switch is needed to prevent that, Hill said.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

[…] The message being heard by the vast majority of the industry could be interpreted as don't bother trying.”\nGuidance is needed from regulators, as is consistency so that deposits in any form are treated the same, Hill said. He criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which requires financial institutions to treat crypto assets differently from any other kind of asset. The definition of crypto asset used in the bulletin is broad enough to include tokenized RWA, he said.\nMagazine: Block by block: Blockchain technology is transforming the real estate market\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

  "article_detailed_content": "Israel’s central bank will support a new Israeli shekel central bank digital currency (CBDC) that has the option of bearing interest.\nIn the March 11 announcement, the Bank of Israel outlined that its shekel CBDC will be implemented in a two-tier model, with instant, 24/7 payments, multipayment support, offline use, limitations on balances and an option for the CBDC to become interest-bearing. The central bank wrote: \n“In the area of privacy, the architecture will allow the central bank, as the system administrator, to define the types of information required for the operation, control, and monitoring of the system. However, the central bank will not have access to personally identifiable information about end users’ balances and transactions.”\nCurrently, commercial banks in Israel pay 4.86% interest on customers’ fiat shekel deposits and savings. Under the central bank’s plans, banks would be able to hold the shekel CBDC as part of their short-term liquidity buffer, which would be non-interest bearing. \n“The data structure must enable the system to comply with all of the assumptions defined in Section 2.1, including the ability to enforce holding restrictions and to apply interest,” researchers wrote, adding: “In particular, in a case where the interest is dependent on the type of user and the size of the balance, there is an advantage to having a centralized database.”\nIsrael has been contemplating the issuance of a digital shekel since 2021, but no concrete pilot tests have been actioned as of the time of publication. “Given the interdependence between the various components of the digital shekel system, the decisions are not final,” said the Bank of Israel. \nIn April 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the country’s central bank could issue a shekel CBDC if stablecoin use increases. “At this point, there are no signs of substantial adoption of stablecoins as means of payment in Israel,” the central bank said at the time.\nRelated: Local Web3 community launches ‘Crypto Aid Israel’ to help displaced citizens\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "Independent (indie) musicians face many challenges on their way to recognition and financial stability, often stemming from the centralized nature of Web2 platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and SoundCloud. While these platforms initially offered promising paths to exposure, the reality has fallen short, leaving artists struggling to secure fair compensation in terms of royalties and control over their work.\nThe issue lies in the way streaming services distribute revenue: a meager portion reaches the artists themselves, with record labels often negotiating significantly higher payouts than indie musicians for their work. Spotify’s reported payout per stream further exemplifies this disparity, falling within a paltry range of $0.003 to $0.005 in 2024.\nAdding insult to injury, Spotify’s recent policy change throws another obstacle in the path of indie artists. In 2024, the platform will cease royalties for tracks receiving fewer than 1,000 streams within a year. While technicalities suggest these tracks will still accrue royalties, the funds will be funneled upward, often benefiting bigger artists. This 1,000-stream cliff creates a significant barrier for indie musicians attempting to break through and build a fanbase.\nOne stat you won’t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform.\n\nThe max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform. pic.twitter.com/OCMHsHNce5\n— United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) November 29, 2023\nAnother major challenge for indie artists is building a loyal fanbase. The current market is saturated with countless independent artists vying for attention. Building a personal brand and effectively utilizing social media platforms can help indie musicians connect with their audience and cultivate a fanbase, but it takes time, money and effort to make it big.\nHow NFTs can help musicians\nThis is where Web3, particularly nonfungible tokens (NFTs), emerges as a solution with the potential to transform the indie music industry. Music NFTs allow artists to sell songs, albums or exclusive digital content directly to their fans. The NFT approach bypasses intermediaries like record labels and streaming platforms, allowing artists to capture a larger share of the revenue generated by their work. Unlike streaming, where earnings are based on unpredictable play counts, NFTs offer the potential for more transparent and direct income streams.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nMusic NFTs also act as a bridge between artists and their fans, fostering a sense of community and ownership. By owning an NFT, fans actively support the artist and gain access to various benefits like early access to new songs or exclusive behind-the-scenes content.\nThe limitations of current music NFTs\nWhile music NFTs already exist on several blockchains, they can only represent one digital asset, such as a single song. This restriction is highly inflexible, as musicians typically work with multiple songs packaged as an album or playlist.\nThe current music NFTs are permanently static, lacking the capacity for updates or changes. Musicians desire the ability to evolve and modify their music and copyright terms over time, enhancing fan engagement by offering a continuous stream of fresh content.\nAlthough music NFTs hold great promise for fostering deeper connections with fan bases, this potential hinges on one critical factor — the ability to update the information embedded in the NFT itself.\nIntroducing dynamic Data NFTs\nItheum Protocol, an omni-chain data ownership infrastructure layer , aims to overcome these limitations by allowing musicians to develop and update their content through its Music Data NFT technology.\nAt the heart of the Itheum Protocol lies Data NFT technology, which allows musicians to transform static or dynamic data assets into NFTs. These NFTs function as transferable licenses, granting ownership and control over sharing or trading access rights to the data. Data NFTs empower creators to tokenize their data, similar to other NFT assets, but with the added flexibility of managing access rights.\nUnlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Music Data NFTs can be updated by artists, allowing for evolving content. This dynamic capability has the potential to enhance fan engagement, offering features like unlocking additional content upon interaction. Moreover, Music Data NFTs give artists greater control over distribution and royalty structures.\nVerified fans who own Data NFTs can also establish direct communication with artists, creating access opportunities for exclusive content such as unreleased music or merchandise. This connection could strengthen the bond between musicians and their fanbase.\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum envisions Music Data NFTs operating seamlessly across various blockchains. The envisioned interoperability enables artists to access diverse NFT ecosystems, potentially building fanbases and extending their exposure to a broader audience across various blockchain communities.\nKey features of Data NFTs. Source: Itheum Protocol\nGiving the power to musicians and fans\nMusicians can showcase their Music Data NFTs on NF.Tunes, a Web3 music portal built on Itheum Protocol’s technology. The platform serves as a space for artists to exhibit their music Data NFTs, allowing fans to explore and listen to new music while engaging with artist communities.\nWith its Music Data NFTs, Itheum paves the way for a more artist-centric future in the music industry. By addressing the limitations of the current NFT models, Itheum offers a glimpse into a future where indie musicians not only navigate the labyrinthine world of music but thrive in it.\nAre you an indie musician who wants to use Music Data NFTs?

The reason can be partially attributed to the upcoming Bitcoin halving in April, where block rewards are scheduled to be slashed in half, thereby reducing miners’ bottom line.

  "article_detailed_content": "MapleStory, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by South Korean video game publisher Nexon with over 400,000 daily active users, will expand its gaming experience to the Avalanche blockchain.\nAccording to a March 11 announcement dubbed “MapleStory N,” the game will be powered by an Avalanche subnet on the namesake blockchain’s cloud network “to proceed without a separate implementation partner, providing greater convenience, more support options, and quick time to market” and offer users new content-generating opportunities. “Users can build out enticing new worlds, extending gameplay, and adding their footprint to the MapleStory Universe,” a spokesperson for Avalanche wrote.\nThe game is scheduled to launch later in 2024. “Our partnership with Ava Labs will allow us to build a stable and complete blockchain ecosystem, enabling us to securely service various dApps along with MapleStory N to amplify our competitiveness,” commented Angela Son, MapleStory Universe’s partnership lead.\nCreated in 2003, MapleStory has immense popularity in the Asia-Pacific region and has surpassed 180 million registered players. Its Web3 venture, MapleStory Universe, uses various nonfungible tokens (NFTs) to enhance the in-game experiences.\nSimilarly, on March 22, 2023, its parent Nexon selected the Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution Polygon to power its blockchain ecosystem. According to Nexon, a Polygon supernet created by Polygon Labs will be deployed within Maplestory to allow players to earn and collect in-game items as NFTs. \nYes yes, I know it's been a while, took my vacation anyway.

  "article_detailed_content": "Major stablecoin operator Tether continues to expand its USDT stablecoin across various blockchain networks, entering a strategic collaboration with the Celo network.\nTether (USDT) on Celo, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 network designed for fast and low-cost payments.\nAnnouncing the news to Cointelegraph on March 11, Tether noted that the new integration brings a range of benefits to USDT, including “notably low, sub-cent transaction fees” hovering around $0.001, enabling feasible microtransactions.\n“One of Celo’s core features since launching in April 2020 was its design for fast, low-cost payments worldwide,” a source close to Celo told Cointelegraph. “Indirectly, as an L2, there is a value sharing happening with Ethereum that’s not happening today as an L1,” a spokesperson said, adding:\n“In transitioning to an Ethereum L2, gas fees would stay low, critical to achieving global prosperity and core to the Celo community mission.”\nUSDT will join an array of stable assets available on the Celo platform, including Mento’s eXOF, which tracks the CFA franc, and the cREAL, which tracks the Brazilian real. The use cases for stable assets on Celo include remittances, savings, lending and cross-border payments.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Tether USDT to the Celo ecosystem, which is fast becoming a leader in stablecoins and real-world assets,” Celo co-founder and foundation president Rene Reinsberg said.\n“With Tether USDT soon available on Celo, users have even more options for fast, low-cost payments and access to robust stablecoin use cases that benefit everyday users around the world,” Reinsberg noted.\nA Tether representative declined to say when the first batch of USDT will be issued and go live on the Celo blockchain.\nRelated: Tether launches recovery tool to migrate USDT between blockchains\nUSDT’s major rival, the Circle-issued USD Coin (USDC), announced a native launch on the Celo blockchain in January 2024 as well. Circle said the first USDC became available on Celo on Feb. 22.\nCelo-based USDT will join 14 blockchains currently supported by Tether, including Tron, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and Omni. Tron and Ethereum are the two largest blockchains for USDT at the time of writing, accounting for 50% and 45% of all issued USDT, respectively, according to Tether Transparency.\nThe news comes amid the crypto community increasingly complaining about high fees on the Ethereum network as Ether (ETH) prices pass $4,000. Skyrocketing ETH fees have also impacted Ethereum-based USDT, as ERC-20 Tether USDT requires ETH gas fees to complete transactions.\nDespite Celo being an EVM-compatible network, there is no dependency on Ethereum in terms of network fees, according to a source close to Celo. “For example, if Ethereum fees go up, it doesn’t mean L2 fees, given certain architectural choices, go up in the same way or at all even,” the person noted.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana’s stablecoin volume\nExchange or buy USDT\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Imagine a future where organizations operate not under individuals’ control but by a community’s collective will. Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO’s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.\nThe challenges around DAOs\nBut as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment?\nOne of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO’s governance.\nWhile some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project’s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project’s growth potential over time.\nRecognition of diverse contributions\nSecure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone.\nBuilt on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap — a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance.\nUnderstanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:\nFacial verification: Through a partnership with Fractal ID, a provider of Web3 identity solutions, AirDAO links wallets to users using facial verification technology. The integration enables the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that verify identities without requiring the disclosure of personal information or compromising user anonymity. Facial verification reduces the ability to create multiple accounts, ensures each vote is from a unique participant and promotes transparency and accountability.\nThe issuance of the AirDAO’s governance soulbound token (SBT), AMB, is also based on the user’s facial recognition biometric data verified by Fractal ID.\nImpact-based governance: AirDAO’s system rewards users with soulbound tokens (SBTs) based on their contributions to the platform, such as providing liquidity or participating in governance discussions. SBTs determine an individual’s voting power, giving a stronger voice to those who actively contribute to the project’s success.\nAirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO\nAirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users’ benefits to the ecosystem.\nA vision for decentralization\nAirDAO’s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform’s commitment to community governance.\nAirDAO’s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO’s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about AirDAO Governance Platform\nJoin support Telegram group for AirDAO governors\n#Blockchain\n#Security\n#Decentralization\n#Identity\n#DAO\n#DeFi\nDisclaimer.

The security firm urged users to revoke the approvals from the trade aggregator to avoid further loss. Security company SlowMist estimated the exploit losses to be around $2.1 million and noted that the attacker swapped the Tether (USDT) for the stablecoin Dai (DAI).\nA day later, the DeFi protocol sent an on-chain message to the hacker, offering a 20% bounty in exchange for returning the remaining stolen funds. The protocol also said they are already working with law enforcement and forensic experts to determine the hacker’s identity.\nOn-chain message sent by Unizen to the hacker. Source: Etherscan\nWhile the bounty negotiations are still ongoing, the DeFi protocol was quick to refund victims of the hack. On March 11, the company announced it would make 99% of the affected users whole as soon as possible.\n“Reimbursement for the rest of those will be given to the same wallets affected starting immediately. While we intend to start distributions today, we are going through each distribution individually in a slow, careful and methodical manner,” they wrote.\nRelated: Crypto phishers stole $47M last month, impersonators on X to blame\nAccording to the announcement, Unizen founder and CEO Sean Noga loaned funds to the company to refund the hack victims. Users who lost below $750,000 will get their funds back, with refunds starting on March 11.\nThe company will return funds in USDT or USD Coin (USDC). However, for those who lost more than $750,000, the DeFi protocol said they would handle the issue on a case-to-case basis. Along with the announcement, the company also shared a video guide teaching users how to review and revoke approvals within the platform to avoid further losses. \nUnizen chief technology officer Martin Granström also said on X they have already collected enough evidence for a post-mortem report and are working with third-party firms on the matter. The executive announced that they would share an incident report soon and promised to invest more in security in the future.\nMagazine: DeFi’s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks",

  "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamic will be even more favorable than after previous halvings in 2012, 2016 and 2020, thanks to the recent launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States.\nBitcoin (BTC) halvings cut miner rewards in half every 210,000 blocks, which is approximately every 48 months.\nThe next halving event will occur at block 840,000 — expected to take place on April 20 — and will see mining rewards reduced from 6.25 BTC ($418,800) to 3.125 BTC ($209,400).\nHistory shows Bitcoin’s price starts ticking upward to break previous all-time highs about four or five months after the halving.\nOn May 11, 2020, during the previous halving, Bitcoin was priced at $8,750. It surged 430% five months later, from $11,500 to $61,300 by mid-March 2021.\nIn doing so, it smashed the previous all-time high of $19,665 on Dec. 16, 2017.\nBitcoin’s change in price between May 11, 2020 and March 15, 2021. Source: CoinGecko\nAnalysts have primarily attributed this to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have caused a radical change in Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamic, according to Jaran Mellerud, a founder and chief strategist at Hashlab Mining, who recently spoke with Cointelegraph.\nSpot Bitcoin ETF issuers are scooping up 2,450 BTC each day while only 900 BTC are mined, Mellerud noted.\n“This number will fall to 450 BTC post-halving in late April [where the ETFs will be] sweeping up BTC at a rate five times higher than BTC’s post-halving supply growth. This huge imbalance between supply and demand will lead to a continuous but volatile upward grind of the BTC price.”\nMellerud comments on Bitcoin’s supply and demand imbalance. Source: Jaran Mellerud on X\nThis will multiply Bitcoin’s demand at a time when the halving will reduce its supply, said Mellerud, who expects Bitcoin’s price to rise substantially higher as a result.\nSouce: Matt Hougan on X\nBitcoin is now more decentralized and secure\nThe health of the Bitcoin network has also strengthened, according to Mellerud, who noted that Bitcoin’s hash rate is five times higher than it was at the last halving.\n“It now requires five times more computing power and associated electricity supply, electrical infrastructure, and mining hardware to attack the network.”\nThe network was already tremendously secure at the time of the 2020 halving, but now it is basically impenetrable, Mellerud added.\nRelated: Bitcoin mining battles 2023 — Surging hash rates test industry limits\nMellerud noted that Bitcoin’s hash rate is now more widely distributed than at the time of the last halving, where Chinese miners controlled a large share of the network.\n“This geographic decentralization is continuing as miners migrate to Africa and Latin America to take advantage of cheaper electricity prices,” he said.\nSouce: Alex Gladstein on X",

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethereum is already “well-positioned” to mitigate the impact of a massive quantum computing attack on the network, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.\nIn a March 9 post to Ethereum Research, Buterin discussed what would happen if a “quantum emergency” happened as early as tomorrow.\n“Suppose that it is announced tomorrow that quantum computers are available, and bad actors already have access to them and are able to use them to steal users’ funds,” Buterin postulated.\n“I argue that actually, we are already well-positioned to make a pretty simple recovery fork to deal with such a situation.”\n“The blockchain would have to hard fork and users would have to download new wallet software, but few users would lose their funds,” he added.\nButerin explained that the process of such a hard fork would involve rolling back the Ethereum network to the point where it is clear that “large-scale theft” was occurring and disabling all traditional transactions from that point.\nEthereum developers would then add a new transaction type — which forms part of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7560 — to allow transactions from smart contract wallets.\nButerin’s breakdown of the EIP required to prevent a quantum-related exploit on Ethereum. Source: Ethereum Research\nWhen a user makes a transaction from their Ethereum wallet, the signature of that transaction reveals the public key, and in a “post-quantum world,” this would see the user’s private key revealed as well.\nThe new transaction type that forms the core part of the quantum-resist EIP would leverage Winternitz signatures and zero-knowledge proof technologies known as “STARKs” to ensure that existing wallets are switched to new validation code, he added.\nAn anonymous user shared an illustrated diagram of Buterin’s theoretical EIP. Source: Ethereum Research\nThis validation code leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction — the underlying technology of smart contract wallets — to prevent private keys from being displayed while signing transactions in the future, rendering these accounts immune from a quantum attack.\nRelated: Ethereum leans into rollup-centric future as Dencun hard fork looms\nAccording to Buterin, users who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are “already safe” from any potential quantum-related exploit, as only the wallet address has ever been made publicly available.\nHe also added that the infrastructure needed to implement such as hard fork “could in principle start to be built tomorrow.”\nThe advent of quantum computing has been a long-feared inflection point for the crypto industry, as a computer capable of breaking blockchain encryption could see once-untouchable user funds stolen in large volumes and at rapid rates.\nHowever, most computer scientists and developers believe that quantum computing is still a ways off, with Google and IBM engineers estimating that quantum computing won’t be sufficiently developed until 2029 at the earliest.\nMagazine: Google to fix diversity-borked Gemini AI, ChatGPT goes insane: AI Eye",

  "article_detailed_content": "Local cryptocurrency stakeholders have lamented the current ban on Binance naira operations in Nigeria, stating it will affect the livelihoods of many Nigerians and could increase youth unemployment in the country.\nIn separate interviews with Cointelegraph, local crypto stakeholders said the delisting of Nigerian naira-related services from Binance will lead to the rise of new crypto exchanges, which will fill the vacuum created by Binance’s exit by complying with local regulations.\nNathaniel Luz, the CEO of Flincap — a liquidity platform for crypto exchanges — said that several Nigerian traders who make a living from trading peer-to-peer on Binance are now affected. However, Luz said that some are trading on WhatsApp and Telegram groups.\nAccording to the chief marketing officer of Flincap, Oladotun Wilfred Akangbe, the continuing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in Nigeria and the decision to halt Binance operations can undermine the confidence of many people in the space. He added that it could lead to massive fear, uncertainty and doubt in Nigeria’s crypto space.\nIn an official statement on its website, Binance said it would automatically convert naira balances to Tether (USDT) from March 8 at 8:00 am UTC and cease support for naira deposits from March 5 at 2:00 pm.\nWithdrawals have not been allowed since March 8 at 6:00 am, and the conversion rate is 1 USDT for 1,515.13 naira. Binance’s peer-to-peer platform delisted all naira trading pairs in late February.\nRelated: Binance temporarily suspends Solana network withdrawals, citing ‘increased volume’\nOn Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were suspected of handling illicit transactions, pointing to “suspicious flows” of funds at Binance.\nAs the suspicions of Binance’s alleged illicit operations in Nigeria intensified, the Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes called Binance CEO Richard Teng to appear before the committee before March 4.\nIn 2023, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Binance Nigeria wasn’t registered or regulated by it, making its operations in Nigeria illegal. In December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria reversed its stance on crypto assets, advising banks to ignore the previous ban on crypto transactions.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana’s stablecoin volume",

  "article_detailed_content": "MakerDAO, the organization responsible for the development of the Maker (MKR) token, has approved an “Executive Vote” to introduce temporary fee adjustments to strengthen the protocol due to heightened market volatility and bullish sentiment resulting in a reduction in reserves for its Dai (DAI) stablecoin.\nThe suggestion comes in response to a rapid decrease in the Dai supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the last seven days, as outlined in the proposal from BA Labs, a member of Maker’s Stability Advisory Council.\nScreenshot of MakerDAO executive vote announcement on X. Source: MakerDAO\nIn the proposal, MakerDAO intends to expedite the approval process for a stablecoin stability measure if users choose to redeem a portion of the $1.1 billion in real-world assets (RWA) available on the protocol. Despite Dai being overcollateralized, using RWA vehicles as collateral poses potential liquidity issues if Dai’s selling continues.\n The proposal reads:\n“Liquid stablecoin reserves and reserves deployed to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure generated by the potential bullish market sentiment. The issue lies in the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure toward stablecoins deployed through RWAs.” \nAlthough Maker DAO’s ecosystem is currently stable, it deems it necessary to anticipate potentially unpredictable user actions. The proposed measures include changes to Maker Vaults, the SparkLend DAI Borrow Rate, the Peg Stability Module (PSM), the Dai Savings Rate and the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.\nRelated: Wyoming passes law granting DAOs legal status\nThe adjustments include raising the stability fees on different collateral assets registered on the platform from 15% to 17.25%. In addition, it plans to increase the SparkLend DAI Borrow annual percentage yield from the current 6.7% to 16%. The slate of changes was approved to go into effect from March 10 at 7:55 pm UTC.\nMakerDAO also plans to adjust the PSM to provide a cooldown for debt ceiling increases to drop from 24 to 12 hours. Other measures that will be implemented include incrementing the Dai Savings Rate to 15% and the GSM Pause Delay from 48 hours to 16 hours for swifter implementation of future adjustments.\nWhile these adjustments are temporary, there is no automatic process for reverting the fees. GFX Labs, a blockchain research and development company, expressed on the proposal’s discussion page that the changes were in the right direction but raised concerns about their magnitude, fearing potential market dislocations and disruptions.\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

  "article_detailed_content": "Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon has signed a bill into law establishing a legal framework for the formation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). \nThe bill was sponsored by the legislature’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology and introduces a legal status for decentralized unincorporated nonprofit associations (DUNAs) based in the state.\nThis is huge news for DAOs.\n\nRegistering as a DUNA legal entity will enable DAOs to engage in legal contracts with other entities and provide legal protection to individual DAO members. Other legal entities available to DAOs fall short on these metrics.\n\nLearn more from… https://t.co/j16Zr3xkw1\n— Ross Shuel | shuel.eth (@0xShuel) March 8, 2024\nThe document enacted on March 7 outlines the requirements for forming a DUNA, covers the roles of smart contracts and offers provisions over the legal responsibilities of the association and its members. According to the new law, a DUNA is a separate legal entity from its members, meaning that the DAO can be held liable without implicating its individual members. \n“A person is not liable for a breach of a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association’s contract merely because the person is a member, administrator, authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association or considered as a member by the nonprofit association.”\nA DAO is an entity with no central leadership. The decision-making process is bottom-up, with a community governed by a set of rules enforced by a blockchain. Giving a DAO legal existence enables a decentralized entity to establish contracts with third parties, open bank accounts, pay taxes and meet informational reporting requirements.\nNonprofit status\nIn an analysis on March 8, venture capital firm a16z crypto asserted that there is a “fundamental misunderstanding of the nonprofit designation provided by the new law.\nAccording to Miles Jennings, a16z’s general counsel, and David Kerr, principal at Cowrie law firm, a Wyoming-based DAO is not prohibited from engaging in for-profit activities.\n“Under Wyoming law, both the UNA and the DUNA are able to engage in for-profit activities. This would include the operation of a decentralized exchange protocol, a decentralized social media protocol, you name it.”\nDAOs are also allowed to pay compensation to their members, including in exchange for participation in the governance process, reads the analysis. “Wyoming’s approach supports the web3 ethos, while still enabling cash flows to digital asset holders. This is a significant breakthrough.”\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable? Lessons from the front lines",

According to a press release from TCG World, this marks the animated video’s first appearance in the metaverse at large.\nSource: @OfficialTCGCoin on X.\nAs Cointelegraph reported, TCG World launched in 2021 as a metaverse featuring virtual real estate, Web3 collectibles, and a landscape where pretty much everything could be traded as a nonfungible token (NFT). At the time of its launch, it claimed to be the first 4K VR low poly game and the largest on the BNB Smart Chain blockchain.\nChooky Records is a nontraditional record label that combines digital music with NFTs to create hybrid, tokenized entertainment experiences. It found success in 2023 when the song “Chooky,” by Nigerian recording artist O.T. and Australian/Japanese artist Elesia Iimura became a viral hit.\nBusta Rhymes, a platinum-selling recording artist whose legendary career has produced hit songs in five different decades — including his critically praised appearance on A Tribe Called Quest’s seminal hip hop track “Scenario” — lent his vocals and likeness to the “Chooky” track for its November 2023 audio visualization and the TCG World metaverse experience. \nWhile Chooky Records is a relative newcomer to the independent music scene, its infrastructure has garnered praise throughout the music community. According to the Chooky Records white paper:\n“Chooky allows for artists to not be confined in 360 deals with one off contracts, higher % entitlement to royalties, a high % split from the royalty sharing NFTs, event management, promotion, access to high caliber marketing resources and introductions to some of the most high-profile artists in the industry.”\nRelated: What’s the missing piece for mainstream Web3 adoption?",

  "article_detailed_content": "Web3’s growth presents challenges for newcomers who find navigating various subsectors and DApps confusing. A unified platform would simplify the onboarding process, enhancing clarity and promoting faster adoption of Web3 use cases.\nWeb3, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and digital currencies, is rapidly evolving. However, its fragmented nature mirrors the chaos of the early internet before the dot-com bubble. The lack of interoperability between decentralized networks and poor communication across different Web3 sectors contribute to this disarray.\nToday’s Web3 lacks a unifying ecosystem, causing the market to fracture into multiple, independently evolving use cases. Crypto enthusiasts have to use various decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms to perform multiple transactions and interact with the different sectors of Web3. However, this isn’t a sustainable growth model for the Web3 industry and is more of a deterrent rather than a benefit when it comes to crypto adoption.\nA one-stop shop platform could be a good start for beginners who can try various Web3 use cases from a single starting point. Such a unified experience would provide clarity and a smooth gateway to the Web3 world, acting as a Google-like aggregator for these diverse sectors.\nThe rise of super apps in Web3\nRecognizing the need for a more integrated approach, some Web3 players are moving beyond the hype. Legion Network is emerging as a notable example among these. As a one-stop shop for Web3, Legion Network addresses the complexity of the industry and reaches new audiences. It brings together essential Web3 use cases, including a proprietary crypto wallet with comprehensive portfolio tracking, DeFi swaps and bridges, engaging play-to-earn/win games, captivating quests with prize rewards, a launchpad for emerging projects and a unique SocialFi experience that fosters community engagement.\nUsers can download Legion's super app, which is available on the App Store and the Google Play Store. The app has grown significantly since its launch, with over 5 million downloads, an average rating of 4.2 stars from 215,000 reviews, and nearly 500 million game plays. These metrics underscore the app’s popularity and effectiveness in engaging and retaining a diverse user base.\nHere’s a detailed breakdown of the key features that distinguish Legion Network in the Web3 landscape:\nCrypto wallet and asset management: Legion Network offers a fully noncustodial wallet supporting over 15,000 tokens across over 40 blockchains. It allows seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for swapping and bridging and provides features for crypto portfolio tracking and display for nonfungible tokens (NFTs), focusing on user security and ease of use.\nStaking program and Bolts system: Legion Network’s innovative staking program exemplifies their commitment to a sustainable ecosystem. It rewards users with increased access to services based on their staking level, promoting a more active and engaged community.\nMoreover, Legion Network has effectively gamified every aspect of its app. Through Bolts, users earn rewards for their interactions, allowing them to unlock perks across all services. This approach ensures equitable access to the app’s features, regardless of users’ ability to make in-app purchases.\nPlay-to-earn/win games and quests: Gaming and quests are integral to the Legion experience, aligning with the play-to-earn and play-to-win models. Users can complete tasks and quests to win prizes and rewards, sometimes in collaboration with partners.\nThis gamification extends throughout the app with the SocialFi aspect and a raffle system where users can use Bolts earned from platform engagement to enter and win prizes, underscoring the Legion Network ecosystem’s emphasis on gamification.\nLaunchpad for emerging projects: Legion Network’s launchpad introduces users to new blockchain projects, fostering innovation within the Web3 space.\nLearning hub: Integral to Legion’s super app is Empower Academy, a comprehensive learning experience centered around blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and various aspects of the Legion Network ecosystem. The educational platform offers CPD-certified courses and a unique earn-while-you-learn system.\nPersonalized user experience and community building: Legion enhances user engagement by allowing customization of profiles and showcasing NFT collections, staking ranks and wallet stats. The Ambassador Program and the new Groups and Clans feature foster deeper community connections.\nLegion Network’s Bluemoon, a social metaverse with NFT marketplace integrations, prioritizes immersive experiences. The platform caters to creators and businesses, providing a user-friendly infrastructure to build custom metaverse spaces while seamlessly facilitating NFT trading all within a single platform.\nIs a super app the future of Web3?\nThanks to a combination of all major blockchain and Web3 elements, including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, cryptocurrencies, social and the metaverse, Legion Network aims to create an easy access point for everyone new to crypto space and transit users from a Web2 to a Web3 mindset.\nLearn more about Legion Network\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "The Arbitrum DAO is voting to fund the legal defense costs of Tornado Cash’s developers. If approved, the community would donate up to 600,000 ARB tokens in the first year, worth nearly $1.3 million at the time of writing. \nA proposal submitted on March 7 by pseudonymous delegate DK seeks to fund a “robust legal defense” for Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the developers behind the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In addition, the funds could be used for public relations and advocacy efforts promoting awareness around privacy-preserving technologies and legal burdens for developers.\n“By rallying support for their legal fund, we aim to safeguard not only the future of privacy-preserving technologies but also the broader principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within our industry.”\nThe proposal sets three tiers for voting under different funding levels, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 ARB. To date, more than 80% of the votes have been cast for the highest tier. The deadline for voting is March 14.\nThe accusations against Tornado Cash and its founders revolve around the platform’s alleged role in laundering over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. As a result, Tornado Cash has been subject to significant legal actions, including its addition to the United States sanctions lists, effectively banning residents in the country from using the service and sparking controversy within the cryptocurrency community.\nProposal open for vote\nSupporters of Tornado Cash argue that the platform merely provides software for decentralized money transmission and does not directly engage in money transmission itself, which challenges the basis of the charges against its developers. According to the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidelines state that an anonymizing software provider should not be considered a money transmitter.\nStorm and Pertsev face several charges from U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nThe first two charges can each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the charge for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n“These [legal] challenges not only threaten the developers’ ability to continue their work but also undermine the fundamental principles of decentralization and individual freedom upon which projects with privacy-preserving technologies are built.”\nThe community proposal comes just a few days after the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser dedicated to collecting legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, citing a breach of their terms of service that could “expose GoFundMe, its employees or Users to any harm or liability of any type.”\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",

  "article_detailed_content": "Building blockchain infrastructure that attracts developers is key for mass scaling blockchain applications, Anurag Arjun, the founder of Avail and co-founder of Polygon, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on March 7.\n“Lowering developer friction is very important. If you look at the first mobile apps that were built when the initial infrastructure came out, those were very simplistic sort of apps. It took a lot of years of experimentation to build something like Uber or Instagram.”\nArjun added that building developer-focused scaling solutions like layer-2 rollups will be necessary to advance blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps). He said:\n“The real utility of [scaling solutions] is if developers can quickly work with this infrastructure to actually create useful scale apps that go mainstream, for example, right again right now.”\nAverage monthly active developers decreased 24% to 22,411 in 2023, compared to 2022, according to a Jan. 17 report by Electric Capital. The firm attributes this drop to a record number of new developers who joined in 2022. The report notes:\n“While developers overall are down 24%, the most valuable segment of developers (2+ year tenure who contribute the most code) continues to steadily grow.”\nWhen asked about the future of blockchain scalability, Arjun said that he expects to see hundreds of application-specific rollups that will be united under a user experience-friendly app layer, much like today’s Web2 shopping experiences that simplify online purchases.\n“When you click on the buy button on [Amazon], it opens up a payment page, but the user doesn’t know all the complexity behind the process,” said Arjun, adding that Web3 infrastructure will need to simplify the user experience in a similar way to attract more mainstream users.\nArjun is also the co-founder of Web3 data availability and consensus layer, Avail, which closed a $27 million seed funding round on Feb. 26, led by Founders Fund and Dragonfly.\nThe funds will be deployed to help accelerate the unification of Web3 by bolstering the developments of the firm’s three core products, also known as the “Avail Trinity:” the data availability layer, the nexus unification layer and the fusion security layer.\nRelated: Ethena becomes highest earning DApp in crypto",

  "article_detailed_content": "The long-awaited Bitcoin (BTC) price all-time high finally happened on March 5 after the world’s first cryptocurrency rallied above $69,000. \nAnd there we have it. We are officially in a bull market.\nDuring the last bull market, developers, projects and artists all shared their lofty goals and ideas of how crypto and blockchain would revolutionize the entire world. While some of that happened, in reality, a lot was left unachieved.\nSo, now that market conditions have finally improved, everyone has another chance at delivering on what was promised. The Agenda co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond’s assumption is that with better market conditions and profitable balance sheets, blockchain projects should have sufficient runway to build the products and services that hope to solve a lot of the world’s problems.\nOn episode 31 of The Agenda, Salmond and DeYoung share their views on the significance of Bitcoin’s price hitting a new all-time high and what this could mean for crypto in 2024.\nBitcoin’s phoenix moment is a sign of a maturing asset and market\nOnce one gets past the excitement and fixation surrounding Bitcoin hitting new all-time price highs, a more contemplative mood sets in, wherein the significance of the milestone is considered.\nWhen asked about what BTC price going to the moon means in the larger scheme of things, Salmond suggested that it is “a sign of maturity,” especially considering that:\n“The ETFs are kind of like buyers of infinite demand, right? They’re like purchasers of infinite demand. Every day for the last two or three weeks, they’ve been buying $500 million minimum of Bitcoin daily, or $450 million daily. Even today, as Bitcoin price sold off after hitting a new all-time high, ETFs like IBIT from BlackRock traded like 1 billion shares.”\nDeYoung expressed his perspective that, unlike previous bull markets, social chatter from non-crypto bros pales in comparison to what was seen in 2017 and 2020 and that he found himself somewhat surprised not to be looking at his portfolio value every five minutes:\n“I’m here for something deeper. So yeah, now that the price is back, I feel like I’m a bit detached from that. And I also think that we’re just — I mean, you can correct me if you disagree — but I feel like we’re just still so early into this bull run that I feel like getting super hyped up about hitting $69,000 is a bit premature, I guess.”\n2024 will be more about results than ideas\nSalmond and DeYoung agreed that in 2024, blockchain and crypto’s success is more likely to be defined by builders’ ability to deliver useful products and services instead of the value of their tokens. DeYoung said:\n“I hope that it means that some of the people that are riding the wave up will then take some of their money and throw it into the more passion projects. Like they made their money with the [...] hype plays, maybe the bigger projects that make a little cash. Now they’ve got an extra few ETH lying around, and they can throw it into their friend’s passion project and help that get off the ground, or the kind of cool, unique use cases.”\nDeYoung suggested that the synergy between crypto and artificial intelligence will continue to strengthen as the need to verify data and media becomes more necessary. According to DeYoung, blockchains seem perfectly purposed for cataloging and authenticating data, and he expects that they will play a critical role in media and possibly in government in the coming years.\nRelated: Bitcoin accumulation phase ends as ETFs fuel new $100K BTC price target\nSalmond, on the other hand, is hopeful that music nonfungible tokens (NFTs) will become a trendy industry again in 2024:\n“You know, the market blew up two years ago. So, I thought the phoenix of NFTs would be music NFTs. I really thought that that was the one kind of subsector of the industry that made the most sense and would have the most growth — it would just be easy to kind of bridge between Web3, blockchain and the traditional music industry. And there were so many platforms and people that were fundraising to the tune of tens of millions of dollars for music NFTs that I’m surprised nothing has happened.”\nSalmond conceded that perhaps the timing of his high expectations lack patience, something that he explained is critical in the fintech space:\n“One thing I’ve learned investing in Ethereum, Bitcoin maybe, but really Ethereum and some of the other, Ethereum-like coins — one thing I’ve learned about tech companies is you don’t expect results at the end of one year, or even at the end of two years, or even at the end of three years. You expect the payoff and the result at the end of five or 10 years. Like ETH is clearly a five-to-10-year investment.”\nTo hear more from Jonathan and Ray’s conversation on The Agenda — including juicy details about upcoming episode guests — listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

  "article_detailed_content": "Optimism Foundation — the organization behind the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Optimism — announced a private sale of about 19.5 million of its governance tokens. \nOptimism (OP) tokens are worth about $4.62 on the market, making the number of tokens sold worth around $90 million at the time of writing. While the foundation is offloading a large number of tokens, it mentioned in the announcement that the sale included a vesting period of two years, prohibiting the buyer from selling the tokens before then.\nWithin the vesting period, the Optimism Foundation highlighted that the buyer can still use the tokens for governance participation. The foundation wrote:\n“During the lock-up, the purchaser will be able to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for participation in governance.”\nThe organization also explained that the tokens were from an “unallocated portion of the OP token treasury.” The foundation said these assets are part of the organization’s original working budget, which is 30% of the initial OP token supply.\nThe foundation informed the community that the OP tokens will be sent in several transactions in the coming days. Optimism assured the community that these were planned transactions, suggesting they were the tokens sold in the private sale.\nRelated: $900M in vested tokens set to be released in February\nOptimism did not disclose the details of the sale or the buyer, as the transaction was private. This sparked some discussions on X, with some viewing the sale negatively while others defended the foundation.\nEthereum advocate Anthony Sassano said that while he loves Optimism and has invested in it, private sales without transparency leave “a bad taste” in his mouth. Meanwhile, other community members argued that the team behind Optimism has to earn a living, too.\nCommunity members discussing the Optimism private sale. Source: 0xBoboShanti on X.\nThis is not the first time Optimism has conducted a private sale of its tokens. On Sept. 21, 2023, the network transferred 116 million OP tokens, worth about $160 million at the time, after a private sale it conducted.\nAt the time, some observers feared the sale would affect prices negatively. However, the tokens were also subjected to a two-year lockup, meaning they did not immediately impact the token’s price.\nMagazine: Zhu Su pumps Milady to $19K, Alchemy Pay crypto bank, HK tokens: Asia Express",

  "article_detailed_content": "Mobile device users in emerging economies and those hampered by outdated hardware could tap into a new virtual smartphone application running on Solana’s blockchain and decentralized cloud infrastructure.\nAphone debuted in the Solana ecosystem on March 7 as a web-based virtual smartphone that gives users access to various Web3 and conventional applications. APhone ecosystem development and growth lead Jennifer Booze unpacked details of the service in correspondence with Cointelegraph following its launch.\nCointelegraph tested Aphone’s virtual device, which features several Web3 DApps and conventional mobile applications. Source: Aphone\nAphone looks and feels like an Android smartphone and is platform-agnostic, meaning it can operate on a browser, Android or Apple device. Booze says it functions more like an operating system with its interface, features and underlying technology rather than replacing a device’s operating system.\n“It’s a cloud smartphone environment that users can access through their current devices, leveraging decentralized cloud computing to run Web3 applications smoothly without needing local hardware upgrades,” Booze explains.\nThe team envisions the virtual device as a means of onboarding users to Web3 applications and protocols previously hindered by the hardware limitations of devices.\nRelated: Solana Saga fetches up to $5K on eBay as Bonk frenzy causes sell-out\nAphone’s service bypasses the hardware limits of older smartphone models by operating on a decentralized cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) computing infrastructure, Aethir. Aphone’s interface and its applications run on the cloud service, which allows users to access apps and games that the physical device would not be able to handle.\nBooze said the virtual device’s primary use case is to drive access to the broader Web3 ecosystem as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous in emerging markets alongside the proliferation of mobile internet access.\n“By leveraging Aethir’s decentralized cloud technology, APhone enables these users to experience advanced Web3 applications, NFTs, DeFi platforms, blockchain games and run multiple smartphones on a single device.”\nThe virtual alternative to buying a new smartphone will cost users $20 a year. Prospective users can buy an Aphone nonfungible token (NFT), which is minted and burned on the Solana blockchain, giving users access to the virtual device.\nThe device will also provide access to several decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) operating on Solana. This includes Helium, which rewards users for providing network coverage and validating transactions.\nRelated: ‘107,000 GPUs on the waitlist’ — Io.net beta launch attracts data centers, GPU clusters\nCointelegraph asked why Aphone needs to operate on blockchain infrastructure and the purpose of its native PHONE token. Booze said that operating on Solana offers high transaction speeds, lower costs and enhanced security and decentralization.\n“These features support a seamless Web3 experience, including managing NFTs, tokens, and accessing DApps. Aethir’s infrastructure enables the powerful processing capabilities required for demanding Web3 applications, making the integration of blockchain technology essential for APhone’s operation,” Booze adds.\nThe device’s native token is set to be used for governance and rewards incentivization mechanisms to drive user engagement and participation.\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored, DePINs are making their mark as resources to power artificial intelligence tools, which are becoming increasingly valuable. Recently developed DePIN platform IO.net will allow users to source GPU computing power for AI and machine learning, with Solana’s blockchain used to process and facilitate millions of microtransactions to data centers and hardware providers.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana’s stablecoin volume",

  "article_detailed_content": "Researchers in the United Kingdom have studied the viability of current intellectual property (IP) laws and their application to new technologies like the metaverse. In the study, the researchers identified the shortcomings of existing laws and presented their recommendations. \nOn March 7, the U.K. government published an externally commissioned research report titled “IP and Metaverse.” The report dove into the existing literature on IP laws and how they can apply to the metaverse. Within the study, the researchers concluded that there are metaverse-specific IP issues, such as IP governance in an interoperable environment and regulating technologies like the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within virtual worlds.\nAccording to the report, many legal challenges come with interoperability, including the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted work. The researchers highlighted that the lack of interoperability has been important in preventing people from illegally distributing copyrighted material. With interoperability being a key feature in a metaverse, the researchers believe this could pose a challenge in governing the use and circulation of copyrighted work.\nMeanwhile, blockchain’s inherent characteristics, such as immutability or being “tamper-proof,” also pose a challenge to enforcing IP laws. The researchers wrote:\n“Blockchain’s inherent resistance to change or correction undermines the ability to flexibly manage or update IP rights. This is an issue which becomes especially worrisome in the context of ownership disputes, as well as for navigating the termination of agreements and rights if licensors or rightholders seek to leave the Metaverse.”\nHowever, AI use in the potential metaverse governance of IP also poses some anticipated challenges. The researchers argued that algorithmic management of infringements is “extremely vulnerable to misuse” because of the absence of human oversight to guarantee the legitimacy of enforcement.\nRelated: Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment\nApart from this, AI-generated content also brings up another challenge for IP enforcement in the metaverse. According to the study, reliance on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of inventorship in content. The research highlighted examples and cases that showed that “only works partially assisted by AI” are able to be protected by IP laws.\nBecause of the anticipated issues in IP governance within the metaverse, the researchers concluded that there’s a need for clarity on a “plethora of key issues.” This includes legal issues on copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the metaverse. Because of this, the researchers believed that it’s necessary to formulate IP approaches for addressing governance and enforcement issues for a metaverse.\nMagazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3: Tony Pearce’s journey in time and space",

  "article_detailed_content": "While technologists continue to explore artificial intelligence (AI) use cases in all business verticals, a Coinbase research report suggests that AI-related tokens may be over-hyped right now, at least in the short and medium term. \nThe rising popularity of generative AI spurred niche crypto sub-ecosystems over the last couple of years. However, Coinbase research analyst David Han believes that the rapid changes in AI “make us cautious” of the long-term sustainability of most AI tokens.\nOne of the primary challenges with crypto AI projects lies within the core of both technologies. While crypto projects often aim for decentralization, the current AI offering relies heavily on centralized components and data sources, argues Han.\nIn addition, most projects in the niche have failed to attract investors — resulting in under-indexed capital allocation.\nThe report highlights two opportunities for the crypto AI ecosystem — improving the blockchain data for creating human-readable transactions and analysis and helping decentralize the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han said:\n“A decentralized AI future, as it is currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed — in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.”\nDespite the negative outlook, many AI tokens haverecently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributed this to the market sentiment built by the broader crypto market and supported by related AI news headlines.\nAI tokens have a wide distribution of returns on days where BTC traded negatively. Source: coinbase.bynder.com\nThe crypto AI narrative could grow even stronger amid the continued constructive crypto market and the outperforming AI sector. However, Coinbase suggests that driving “meaningful adoption” will require more than just decentralizing AI components.\nIt is important to note that the AI ecosystem is currently in its nascency and will have to “understand the underlying trading narrative” at the very least, eventually providing a comparable alternative to today’s crypto assets.\nRelated: Coinbase shares climb after-hours as exchange fixes site jitters\nComplimenting Coinbase’s suggestion for meaningful developments in the crypto AI sphere, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently said AI could becrucial to eradicating bugs buried deep within its code.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shares optimism about using AI to fix blockchain bugs. Source: Vitalik Buterin on X\nOn Feb. 19, Buterin shared his excitement for AI-powered auditing to identify and fix buggy code in the Ethereum network, describing it as the “biggest technical risk” to the network.\nAI tokens cumulatively hold a market capitalization of $51.18 billion as of March 8, according to Crypto.com data. These tokens serve AI-based projects, applications and services, such as decentralized AI marketplaces, AI-powered trading algorithms and AI-driven decentralized autonomous organizations, to name a few. \nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

Phaver introduces a Web3 social app with a gamified system to combat botting and incentivize genuine user engagement.\nSocial media has a fake account problem, and a 2018 survey highlighted a growing concern among parents of teens — with over 65% alarmed by fake accounts and bots on social media.\nThe discovery of 1,305 bot accounts on X (formerly Twitter) that spread political disinformation during a critical Republican debate and a Donald Trump interview have underscored the extent of the problem and its potential to disrupt the fabric of democratic discourse.\nIndiana University also conducted research that uncovered a bot network of 1,140 ChatGPT-powered X accounts that stole images to create fake profiles and engaged with each other through replies and tweets using advanced artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe battle against bots and fake accounts in social media\nFor traditional social networks, addressing this crisis of user authenticity is a daunting task. Over 47% of 2022’s web traffic was bot-generated, with 30% being harmful bots. Emerging as a potential solution with blockchain, Web3 offers mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of every participant on a specific platform.\nPhaver, a Web3 social app, introduces a gamified solution to fight against bot accounts and incentivize users to build a reputation on social media. By implementing a level system similar to loyalty tiers in airline programs, Phaver aims to discourage detrimental practices plaguing the current social media landscape, such as farming and multi-accounting.\nPhaver aims to build a more meritocratic and user-owned internet. Source: Phaver\nUsers accumulate a credibility score akin to status miles, which determines their level within the app. Phaver’s system penalizes harmful behaviors and rewards genuine engagement and credibility building with points — comparable to reward miles — instead of merely increasing follower numbers. Monthly redemption based on levels further disincentivizes abuse, promoting a healthier digital ecosystem. Users can increase their reputation, for example, by connecting various NFTs from a combination of wallets to their Phaver profile.\nFrom Web2 limitations to Web3 opportunities\nThe platform enhances the user experience with perks for different levels, including benefits within the app, such as increased Phaves (akin to super-likes) and the ability to post sponsored content, along with external rewards like access to partner whitelists. Designed to ensure a balanced supply-demand in the market, Phaver’s mechanism also offers benefits to early adopters, aiding the network’s growth.\nBy the end of 2023, Phaver’s innovative system had attracted over 100,000 wallets, connecting NFTs worth more than $100 million. With the uniqueness of profiles in higher levels reaching 99.9%, the platform showcases its effectiveness in fostering a genuine and engaged community.\nPhaver lets users opt in and out of the on-chain Lens posting depending on their needs. Source: Phaver\nPhaver has integration with the Lens Protocol, a Web3 social graph on the Polygon blockchain, and CyberConnect, a Web3 social network, to create a decentralized social platform where users can securely store their content on-chain.\nBy leveraging these technologies, Cointelegraph Accelerator participant Phaver safeguards user data against centralized control and ensures users can move seamlessly between apps without losing their content and followers.\nThe platform raised $7 million in funding and has shown robust traction, boasting over 250,000 unique app installs and more than 50,000 daily active users, with retention rates surpassing Web2 standards. According to Phaver, users in Korea average 6 hours weekly on the platform.\nToday, we are excited to announce that Phaver has raised $7M Seed financing round to accelerate further the adaptation of web3 social. 🦄 https://t.co/fVAIJ3LDmG pic.twitter.com/nNMJVcfQ2p\n— Phaver 🦄 (@phaverapp) October 5, 2023\nThe rise of bot networks and traditional platforms’ inability to discern between genuine and artificial accounts have highlighted the limitations of Web2 technologies.

In addition, users can swap crypto across more than 40 blockchains into their bank accounts and use fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, euro, or Swiss Franc, for transactions and expenses. Developers further stated:\n\"After creating the bank accounts in the SafePal mobile wallet, the credentials are minted as NFTs on Arbitrum (an Ethereum Layer 2 rollup), ensuring all related transactions are securely and transparently recorded on-chain. The crypto Visa cards are also linked to third-party payment platforms like Paypal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay, enhancing the convenience for users.\"\nSafePal currently operates as a self-custody wallet and claims it has approximately 10 million users worldwide. Shortly after the crypto winter of 2021-2022, the firm's CEO Veronica Wong told Cointelegraph that \"the malpractice of centralized platforms has indeed catalyzed the adoption of self-custody solutions. This should not just be a temporary surge of interest, but a key impetus to strengthen the adoption of self-management for assets.\"\nSince the collapse of centralized finance entities such as FTX and Celsius, self-custody wallets have been rising in popularity. On Dec. 7, 2023, Jack Dorsey’s Block launched a self-custody wallet solution with access in over 95 countries. On Aug. 10, 2023, cross-chain wallet BitKeep changed its name to Bitget Wallet after securing a $30 million investment from the exchange to grow its multichain swap platform. \nRelated: How to set up and create an Ethereum wallet",

  "article_detailed_content": "The Greek stock exchange announced that it is considering launching its new tool, the electronic book building (EBB), on the Sui blockchain ecosystem. \nIn a blog post on March 6, Sui revealed that the EBB will be developed in collaboration between the Athens Exchange Group (ATHEX) and Mysten Labs, the original contributor to the Sui ecosystem.\nATHEX’s EBB would be a new fundraising future, which would allow early-stage and mature companies to list transferable securities. Sui would host ATHEX securities, which would be minted as digital certificates if played out.\n“In this form they would be protected by strong security and transferable, with a transparent chain of custody,” the post read. It highlighted that while blockchain technology seems to be a “natural fit” for stock market-related mechanisms, the EBB deployment on Sui would be one of the first to utilize the technology in such a way.\nEBB would be deployed as a blockchain-based “meta-layer” over the current trading order routing system on ATHEX. According to the blog post, the tool would offer liquidity for business proposals for companies looking to fundraise.\nThe announcement said the project collaboration is still in the evaluation phase and hinges on performance and ATHEX choosing blockchain technology to host its new tool.\nRelated: Facebook, Instagram go down on Super Tuesday, take Meta stock price with them\nThe Sui Network is a layer-1 blockchain ecosystem that launched its mainnet in May 2023, and focuses on digital asset ownership. \nA few months after its mainnet launch, it took steps to simplify Web3 logins for users on its Sui-powered apps by allowing logins using Google, Facebook, and Twitch login details via a new zkLogin (Zero Knowledge login) feature.\nSince its launch it has built up a reputation for being able to handle high transaction volumes while still maintaining low fees.\nIn February of 2024 the Sui Foundation launched a Blockchain Academy with United Arab Emirates-based school, the American University of Sharjah, to increase student awareness of blockchain technology and its usability for creating applications and platforms.\nThe Sui Foundation managing director Greg Siourounis told Cointelegraph in an interview that he sees the goal of this university initiative as being to educate people on blockchain usabili while providing the right tools.\nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

  "article_detailed_content": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has complete a memorandum of understanding with Gluwa Nigeria to promote the usage of the eNaira central bank digital currency (CBDC). Gluwa is a blockchain-based financial platform that has been active in Nigeria for several years.\nAs an agent partner of the CBN, Gluwa will integrate its Credal technology into the eNaira platform, according to a statement sent to Cointelegraph. It plans to enable the creation of “credit reputations” for unbanked users, thus furthering financial inclusion. The credit profiles it will create will be “accessible across borders” and increase the CBDC’s effectiveness:\n“The integration of Credal is anticipated to streamline loan origination, management, settlement, and credit assessment processes for local fintech lenders.”\nThis is the latest of many attempts by the CBN to boost eNaira usage. The eNaira is the world’s second-oldest CBDC, launched in October 2021. As of mid-2023, less than 1% of Nigerians with bank accounts had eNaira wallets, and less than 1.5% of wallet holders were active in a week.\nRelated: Nigerian central bank adds NFC upgrade to eNaira for contactless payments\nCredit ratings are a sore point in Africa.

Other blockchain-based solutions offered to provide Africans with credit histories use soulbound nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and capture information from low-value peer-to-peer transactions.\nMany of the payment solutions available in Africa, including Gluwa, depend on the use of mobile phones in place of traditional financial infrastructure.\nSource: @kbwofficial\nGluwa has been active in Nigeria since at least 2022 when it cooperated with the Lagos regional government to tokenize agricultural assets. It made a well-publicized pitch to the Nigerian government to advise it on cryptocurrency policy in April 2023. The Nigerian government has often been at odds with cryptocurrency exchanges.\nBinance will cease operations with the naira on March 8 after Nigerian government criticism of crypto exchanges singled it out in February.\nGluwa founder and CEO Tae Oh is also the head of the Creditcoin Network, which, like Gluwa, is a layer-1 blockchain.

He stated:\n“The magic part is that someone else can still do the math on the locked box, without ever opening it or seeing your secret. When they're done, you can unlock the box and see the result of the math, with your message still safe and secret inside.”\nA visualization of Zama's FHE technology. Source: Zama\nAccording to Paillier, Zama has already onboarded several significant clients since its foundation in 2020, including Shiba Inu, which is using Zama’s tech to “construct an entire network state.” SHIB adopted a new FHE-enabled privacy infrastructure in late February 2024, aiming to improve on-chain privacy.\nRelated: Sam Altman’s Worldcoin ordered to stop collecting data in Spain\n“By making FHE more accessible and efficient for developers to use, Zama wants to eventually empower businesses to leverage cloud computing and other technologies without compromising on privacy,” Paillier said. This approach involves creating user-friendly tools, libraries, or platforms that integrate FHE into everyday digital services, making it easier for firms to adopt this advanced encryption without needing specialized knowledge, he added.\nZama CTO also emphasized that the company’s solution has made a breakthrough in terms of a tradeoff between on-chain transparency and off-chain privacy.\nDevelopers can deploy the “best of both worlds,” or execute confidential smart contracts on encrypted data without sacrificing either confidentiality or composability, Paillier noted.\nMagazine: Real-life Doge at 18: Meme that’s going to the moon",

Tesla’s wallet now holds about 11,509 BTC at the time of writing, 1,789 more than the 9,720 BTC it reported during its last earnings report.\nTesla Bitcoin wallet. Source: Arkham\nThe Elon Musk-led Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in February 2021, near the peak of the last bull run, and it announced plans to accept Bitcoin payments for its cars. However, the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC) adoption was short-lived, with the company first selling about 10% of its holdings in March 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, the electric car maker sold approximately 75% of its Bitcoin reserves.\nA timeline of Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings and sales:\nFebruary 2021: Bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin\nMarch 2021: Sold 4,320 BTC\n2022: Sold 29,160 BTC\n2023: There was no change in the balance of 9,720 BTC\nMusk has had a love/hate relationship with Bitcoin. In 2021, he expressed optimism about BTC, announcing plans for Tesla to store its own Bitcoin using on-chain wallets. However, within weeks, Musk dropped plans to receive BTC for Tesla cars, citing environmental concerns about Bitcoin mining.\nRelated: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs\nOne user on X was curious whether Tesla has started repurchasing Bitcoin or whether the recent change in figures is due to an accounting error. Another user suggested that the company might have started buying BTC after the last earnings call and could report the newly purchased BTC in its next call. Tesla and Musk have yet to comment on whether Tesla is buying BTC.\nBesides Tesla, Musk’s other company, SpaceX, also holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet after MicroStrategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor convinced Musk to add Bitcoin to his company’s balance sheet. MicroStrategy holds 193,000 BTC, making it the largest institutional holder of BTC in the world.\nDuring a panel discussion at the Bitcoin Atlantis conference on March 1, Saylor argued that AI and exchange-traded funds would usher in a decade-long “gold rush” for Bitcoin. \nMagazine: MakerDAO’s plan to bring back ‘DeFi summer’ — Rune Christensen",

  "article_detailed_content": "Layer-2 protocols scaling the Ethereum blockchain are set to benefit from significantly reduced rollup costs when the Dencun hard fork hits mainnet. Still, end-users might not reap the full benefit immediately.\nPolygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman tells Cointelegraph that Ethereum’s latest hard fork, which features several improvement proposals (EIPS), will take a few weeks to fully implement by rollup protocols:\n“Within about a month and a half or two months, every single L2 that wants to use blob space as a rollup will be moved over, and then users will see the full benefit.”\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\nThe Dencun hard fork incorporates a total of nine different EIPs. The name of the upgrade is a combination of the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum’s execution layer and the Deneb upgrade on the consensus layer.\nWhat does EIP-4844 do?\nSilverman explains that a major focal point of the hard fork is EIP-4844, which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n“There’s only one type of storage in Ethereum currently — call data storage on the execution layer. It’s permanent, meaning if I post something, whether it’s the image for an NFT or transaction data for a rollup, all Ethereum nodes must store that state forever,” Silverman explains.\nEIP-4844 creates a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing the blob space. Using call data for storage was expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely.\nRelated: Make Ethereum cheap again: ‘Blobs’ to be launched via Dencun upgrade on March 13\nProto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after a fixed period of time, estimated to be 18 days. Silverman explains:\n“The idea with these blobs in EIP-4844 is to create this brand new section of storage that I can’t actually execute. I can’t touch them inside of the Ethereum EVM but Ethereum, the protocol, guarantees its storage for a certain timeframe.”\nSilverman adds that because blobs are stored temporarily, they’re drastically cheaper for rollups and allow for the same security guarantees.\nRollup benefits won’t be immediate\nProto-danksharding has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community, given its impact on the cost of rollup data storage in the future. Various layer-2 developers have touted rollup costs to be reduced by 10 to 50 times, but Silverman said the true impact will only be realized once Dencun hits the mainnet.\nDencun is set to hit the Ethereum mainnet on March 13. Source:  Tim Beiko on X.\nThe Polygon Labs vice president of Product notes that the impact will not be immediate. The Dencun hard fork is scheduled for March 13, after which rollups will have to do their own updates before taking advantage of the new storage space:\n“Each rollup has to go through their own governance and upgrade procedures to change their contracts, to move from pointing to call data to point to the new blob space.”\nSilverman says that Polygon has been working hard to expedite its own implementation of EIP-4844. At the same time, conversations with counterparts at Optimism, zkSync and Arbitrum indicate that L2s are eager to take advantage of the hard fork as quickly as possible.\nEthereum leans into rollup-centric future\nDencun also represents the realization of Ethereum’s shift toward a layer-2-centric scaling approach. Silverman says Ethereum is looking to “slow down and ossify” its core components while leaving innovation and user-level focus to L2s.\n“This is an Ethereum roadmap item that says, as opposed to the base chain being responsible for scaling, rollups are really where the future is. We’re going to make changes to make them cheaper and more attractive to users and be the standard-bearer for Ethereum,” Silverman said.\nMajor rollup players have even begun to coordinate among themselves with the formation of Roll Call, where these layer 2s meet, discuss and produce improvement proposals.\n“These are changes that will only ever be on L2. Changes to the EVM that are not coming to mainnet Ethereum, things like new forms of account abstraction, new pre-compiles, new opcodes,” Silverman adds.\nRelated: Key elements to watch on the Ethereum network roadmap\nDencun might not immediately impact rollup costs, but Silverman does expect some fanfare when the hard fork is finalized. Silverman said:\n“EthStaker always does a great stream. You’ll see some fun experiments at launch as well. Developers at ETH Denver said they’ll be doing ETH blob Ordinals to clog up the blob space.”\nAs the staggered implementation of EIP-4844 by rollups occurs, the ecosystem will begin to see the true impact of proto-danksharding. Silverman also believes that the more L2s joining the blob space will gradually lessen the impact of its cost reduction.\nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

  "article_detailed_content": "Of the 44 active Ethereum layer-2 (L2) blockchains in existence today, “only a few” will still be around in five years, said Kenny Li, co-founder and chief operating officer of Manta Pacific.\nAccording to data from L2Beat, there are currently a total of 44 active Ethereum L2 networks, boasting a combined total value locked (TVL) of $36.92 billion, with Arbitrum standing in first place with $14.5 billion TVL.\nHowever, Li claims the future is only properly paved for “modular” blockchains such as Manta, Celestia and Cosmos.\nCritics of this viewpoint, however, argue the term is simply a “marketing stunt” and the success of a network has nothing to do with its approach to development and scalability.\n‘Monolithic’ BTC and ETH killers\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Li argues the flood of new L2s on the Ethereum network is charting the same path as “forks” of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks in the past — none of which “survived.”\nThere are 44 active Ethereum L2s with a combined TVL of $36 billion. Source: L2Beat\n“With all of the Bitcoin forks — Bitcoin Cash and BSV — they all took an existing technology and forked it,” Li explained.\n“They said: ‘You know what? We’re going to make these minor changes to it. And by making these minor changes to it, we’re going to create something that’s ‘better than Bitcoin,’” Li said, adding:\n“Fast forward to 2024, it’s just Bitcoin. There’s no other Bitcoin fork community that has any comparable metrics, any comparable community that even comes close to the original Bitcoin.”\nLi added that the same thing played out with Ethereum in 2016 when new networks such as EOS and NEO attempted to position themselves as “Ethereum killers” by offering alternative Ethereum Virtual Machine and VM environments that tried to make slight tweaks to the pre-existing Ethereum ecosystem.\nIn Li’s view, the central issue with all of the Bitcoin and Ethereum “forks” was that they were all built “monolithically,” meaning that they didn’t allow for the quick integration and adoption of new technology that showed up as time went on.\n“They all built monolithically, and what happened to them, right? Fast forward again to 2024, Ethereum is the dominant player,” Li said.\n“Will we see this many L2s in five years or so? I don’t think so. Only a few will survive.”\nModular blockchains are networks that export their primary tasks: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability to external blockchains, which proponents say offer greater design flexibility.\nIn contrast, monolithic blockchains prioritize a single-system architecture, which handles all tasks within a single layer of the network.\nSome, however, don’t see any reason to debate “modular vs. monolithic” at all.\nMaybe it’s all a ‘marketing stunt’\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, described the relatively new debate around the two terms as a “marketing stunt” introduced by Celestia.\nWhile many understand Ethereum’s more “modular” architecture — relying on L2s to complete specific tasks — as standing in direct contrast to the “monolithic” nature of other higher-throughput networks, such as Solana or Avalanche, Federa disagrees with the use of the term entirely.\n“We have to remember that the modular-versus-monolithic debate is all a marketing stunt,” said Federa. “Celestia created this distinction between modular and monolithic. It’s not a natural distinction, and there’s nothing organic about it.”\nLi claims that Manta — launched on Jan. 18 — could be described as the “first and largest” modular layer-2 network on Ethereum, as it uses Optimism’s OP stack and utilizes Celestia for data availability (though Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin would say that makes it a “validium” and not a genuine L2).\nAt the time of publication, Manta is the fourth-largest L2 network in terms of TVL, only recently overtaken by the new L2 Blast, which launched its mainnet on March 1.\nManta Pacific is the fourth-largest Ethereum L2 by TVL. Source: L2Beat\n“We don’t build in a monolithic way. We haven’t built anything in terms of core architecture just by ourselves,” Li explained.\nRelated: Bitcoin layer 2s among catalysts of this bull cycle, Bitcoin OG says\n“We’re taking a very modular approach, which means that we’re able to essentially plug and play different technologies that are available at different times so we can continue to adapt to changing demands,” Li added.\nFedera, however, argues that there’s no need to make a distinction between the two approaches.\n“The truth is, there is no such thing as a modular system, and there’s no such thing as a monolithic system.”\nFedera explained that a monolithic network is simply an “integrated” blockchain where tasks are handled in a single layer, whereas “modular” — or “fragmented” networks — complete the same functions across several layers and don’t actually contribute considerably to the success or outcomes of a given network.\n“It’s like how the terms ‘pro-life’ and ‘pro-choice’ are, are two positive spins on something, right? Like, no one is actually anti-life or anti-choice, right? This is all just marketing terminology to put forward a certain narrative that people want to talk about.”\n“I think that setting up these things as being at odds with one another is not a particularly useful or accurate way to think about these systems. They’re just different software architecture choices that are not actually that different at the end of the day,” Federa said.\nMagazine: Web3 Gamer: Sweatcoin says shaking is faking, MotoDEX review, Gods Unchained 2024",

In a recent X post, the exchange stated that “users engaging in normal trading activities will not be affected” by its clawback policies, which it claims are in place to protect the exchange against alleged market manipulation. Meanwhile, some customers say that funds were unjustly deleted from their accounts on the exchange.\nMEXC is the 11th-largest centralized crypto exchange by trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap, with approximately $1.3 billion worth of spot trading volume each day. The exchange is especially well known for its perpetual futures trading platform, which does over $7 billion in daily volume.\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph in February, an MEXC user with the screen name “Al Gore Rhythms” claimed that MEXC froze his account and deleted some of his funds after several crypto perpetual futures trades. According to him, his trades of BONK, ICP (ICP), SATS and GROK altcoin perpetuals were up by 380% to 2,200% when his account suddenly stopped working. Login attempts then produced error messages stating that his account had been restricted due to “risk control.”\nMEXC error message.

This deduction was allegedly not recorded on his transaction history, although his balance showed that it had been reduced from $75,054.54 to $41,396.54.\nSeeking help from customer service, Al Gore Rhythms opened a ticket asking why the funds had been deducted. In response, MEXC representatives allegedly told him that the exchange had “taken measures to recover the losses incurred” due to “abnormal trading activities” from his account.\nAlleged email from MEXC.

The user showed Cointelegraph a video of his transaction history, which displayed only blank pages. He also produced what he claimed was a screenshot of the transaction history from before it was deleted.\nCointelegraph could not independently confirm the allegations, or whether the video and screenshot were from the same account.\nRelated: RiskOnBlast suspected to be first rug pull on Blast after $1M presale\nAccording to AI Gore Rhythms, he sought further information from MEXC’s customer service and was told that the funds were taken to cover “the losses of the mexc.”\nAlleged conversation between customer service and user. Source: Al Gore Rhythms\nAnother user, Coach K Crypto, also claims that MEXC deducted funds from his account unjustly. According to a Feb. 27 X post from The Gold Pod co-host Mason Versluis, Coach K Crypto claimed that $330,000 was taken from his MEXC account “due to abnormal profit,” which the MEXC customer service representative allegedly called a “crawback,” seemingly mispelling “clawback.”\nIn a reply to the post, MEXC claimed that the exchange’s risk control policy does not affect ordinary users who engage in “normal trading activities.” A spokesperson for the exchange also said there is an appeals process for users who feel this policy has led to unjust deductions.\nCointelegraph was also contacted in February by a different MEXC user from Pakistan who claimed the exchange had frozen his trades and caused them to become liquidated. According to the user, who wished to remain anonymous, the freeze stopped him from closing his trade, resulting in trading losses that otherwise would have been prevented.\nHe claimed the exchange offered to pay him $3,000 in compensation in exchange for deleting his X posts that complained about the incident. However, the exchange allegedly withdrew this offer when his posts aged and stopped receiving as many views. This user did not produce a screenshot of the offer being made.\nRelated: Hong Kong issues warning over imposter crypto exchange posing as MEXC\nCrypto trader Hashmoney told a similar story in a Jan. 4 thread on X. Hashmoney claimed that when their account was frozen, “I was not able to hedge my positions, reduce the margin or do anything at all.” In response, they “requested the customer support that they may keep withdrawals restricted but shall at least allow me to trade so I can prevent my balance from liquidating.”\nHowever, MEXC customer service allegedly only allowed Hashmoney to add to their position for 30 minutes and did not allow them to close it out. As a result, “My whole futures account was liquidated taking away 11000$+ and [the] rest was deducted in daily fees as I was not allowed to hedge my positions,” the user wrote. Hashmoney alleged that they still had $600 remaining in the account but could not withdraw it due to the freeze.\nMEXC replied to Hashmoney’s thread, claiming an investigation was underway and asking the user to contact customer service for an update. Hashmoney claimed they would update the thread when they obtained a resolution. No update has since been posted at the time of publication.\nCointelegraph contacted MEXC for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication. A blog post on the exchange’s official website claims that “abnormal trading behavior” consists of activities such as placing multiple orders and canceling them (often called “spoofing”) or using multiple accounts to artificially inflate volume by trading between them. Al Gore Rhythms claimed that he did not own multiple accounts and did not engage in spoofing.\nSimilar allegations against MEXC were made by multiple users in December. At the time, MEXC claimed that the allegations were misinformation. “Social media is rife with misinformation, and certain individuals purposely distort facts for personal agendas,” a representative stated. The representative also claimed that clawbacks are only implemented after “strict review, in accordance with user agreements.”",

  "article_detailed_content": "Corporate Bitcoin (BTC) investor MicroStrategy is seeking to sell $700 million in convertible notes, up from $600 million announced just days prior, amid an ongoing cryptocurrency bull market.\nAccording to details disclosed on March 6, the 2030 MicroStrategy convertible notes will bear an interest rate of 0.625% per annum with a conversion price of $1,497.68 per share, representing a premium of 21% compared with its current trading price of $1,234.48 at the time of publication. \n“Holders of notes may require MicroStrategy to repurchase their notes on September 15, 2028, or upon the occurrence of certain events that constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest,” the firm said.\nThe notes are only available to accredited or institutional investors. MicroStrategy may redeem the notes for cash after March 22, 2027, if its common stock is trading consistently above 30% of the set conversion price.\nMicroStrategy expects to raise $684.3 million net from the sale, or $782.0 million if purchasers exercise their options, and use the proceeds to purchase additional Bitcoin or for corporate expenses.\nThe company currently holds 193,000 BTC acquired at an average price of $31,544, representing a balance of $12.9 billion and a return of 112% since inception. Simultaneously, the company’s stock has returned 429.2% as part of the broader Bitcoin bull market. \nMichael Saylor, chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, is an avid Bitcoin enthusiast who first incorporated the digital asset into the firm’s corporate asset allocation strategy in August 2020. Since then, MicroStrategy has consistently added BTC to its corporate treasury every quarter. During a panel discussion at the Bitcoin Atlantis conference on March 1, Saylor argued that AI and exchange-traded funds would usher in a decade-long “gold rush” for Bitcoin. \nRelated: Bitcoin price hits $72K in South Korea as ‘Kimchi premium’ returns",

  "article_detailed_content": "The Spanish Agency for the Protection of Data (AEPD) ordered Worldcoin to stop collecting and processing data in Spain on March 6, issuing a temporary order banning operations for a period of three months. \nWorldcoin is a product/service developed by Tools for Humanity, a firm founded by OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman. Its mission, according to the Worldcoin white paper, is to create a “globally inclusive identity and financial network, owned by the majority of humanity” with the stated goal of creating “a potential path to AI-funded universal basic income.\nThe AEPD order claims the agency is investigating complaints that users in Spain aren’t able to withdraw consent and that Worldcoin has allegedly collected data from minors.\nPer a translation via Microsoft:\n“The AEPD, which demands the cessation of the collection and processing of special categories of personal data as well as the blocking of those already collected, has received several complaints denouncing, among other aspects, insufficient information, the collection of data from minors or that the withdrawal of consent is not allowed.”\nWorldcoin sent Cointelegraph the following statement from Data Protection Officer Jannick Preiwisch:\n\"World ID was created to give people access, privacy and protection online. It is the most privacy preserving and safest solution for asserting humanness in the age of AI, and we are always willing to engage with regulators, examine their feedback and answer their questions.\"\nThe statement from Worldcoin continues:\n\"For months we have been engaged with Bavarian data protection authority (BayLDA), who are the lead supervisory authority under the GDPR for Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity. The Spanish data protection authority (AEPD) is circumventing EU law with their actions today, which are limited to Spain and not the broader EU, and spreading inaccurate and misleading claims about our technology globally.\"\n\"Our efforts to engage with the AEPD and provide them with an accurate view of Worldcoin and World ID have gone unanswered for months. We are grateful to now have the opportunity to help them better understand the important facts regarding this essential and lawful technology.\"\nThe Spanish authorities’ injunction comes just a little over a month after Hong Kong’s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) conducted an investigation into Worldcoin.\nAs Cointelegraph reported, PCPD executed search warrants on Worldcoin offices in Hong Kong in January, citing concerns over data privacy.\nThe controversy surrounding Worldcoin stems from its use of biometric scanning devices called “orbs.” Worldcoin users sign up for the service by downloading an app. They’re then directed to the nearest facility containing an orb, where they must submit to have their eye scanned. As human irises are unique to each individual, this method of biometric verification is generally considered more accurate than fingerprinting and other common identification techniques.\nOnce verified, user identities are tied to their unique biometric data, where they can be verified independently using Worldcoin’s services. Those who sign up for the service and activate their accounts in the WorldApp application are given a payment in Worldcoin’s WLD token.\nRelated: Worldcoin soars 140% in a week as wallet app hits 1M daily users\nSource: @Worldcoin on X\nAccording to Tools for Humanity, Worldcoin has 4 million verified users as of March 5, 2024.\nUpdate 6 March, 10:59 AM PST: Added statement from Worldcoin. \nExchange or buy WLD\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Aethir aims to become the AirBnB of spare graphics processing units (GPUs), Dan Wang, the co-founder and chief business officer of Aethir, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n“[Aethir] is a bit like Airbnb, where there are spare vacation homes that are being underutilized, and there’s obviously a demand for some of that unused vacation home time. […] So, at the very base level, we service as a kind of Airbnb for GPU computing.”\nBacked by Nvidia, Aethir is building a decentralized, enterprise-grade GPU cloud infrastructure network for artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming applications.\n“Overall GPU utilization is quite low,” said Wang, adding that Aethir’s intelligent routing feature aims to bolster this, by matching the type of computing demand with the right type of GPU power.\nHigher GPU utilization could lead to more advanced AI use cases due to the decreased cost of computing power, according to Aethir’s Wang. He said:\n“What we foresee happening is a virtuous cycle. The more utilization that we can find for all this GPU computing that’s out there, the higher the utilization, and they can lower their service fees because they’re getting back the invested capital.”\nAethir is preparing to launch its initial node offering, starting March 14, while the public node sale will take place on March 20.\nAethir initial node offering announcement. Source: Aethir, Impossible Finance\nRelated: Bitcoin price hits a new all-time high\nWhile there is a major global GPU shortage, a significant part of this issue is due to the underutilization of older GPU models, according to Aethir’s Wang. He said:\n“There are a lot of older generation GPUs that are severely underutilized, […] but they haven’t found consistent steady use case and demand for it to be fully utilized.”\nChipmaker Nvidia has previously struggled to meet the demand for its GPUs, which are popular among gaming customers and cryptocurrency miners. Nvidia first started having GPU supply issues in 2017, as the bull run of that year attracted more people to crypto mining. After cooling off somewhat in the following years, the GPU shortage emerged once again in 2020 and has shown no signs of abating.\nRelated: Bitcoin price hits $72K in South Korea as ‘Kimchi premium’ returns",

  "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin miner Hut 8 is closing its mining site in Drumheller, Alberta, Canada, due to power disruptions and surging energy costs.\nAccording to the March 6 announcement, Hut 8's Drumheller mining facility, which mines approximately 1.4% of the firm's Bitcoin (BTC) but at the cost of around 11% of its hash rate, will be closed effective immediately.\n\"Following a comprehensive analysis, we have determined that the profitability of Drumheller has been impacted significantly by various factors, including elevated energy costs and underlying voltage issues,\" Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8, said in a statement. Effectively immediately, all of the company's Bitcoin miners will be relocated to its Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada facility. \"Hut 8 will maintain its lease at the site and the option value of re-energizing the site if market conditions improve,\" its staff wrote.\nA combination of factors, such as high energy costs, alongside record mining difficulty and the anticipated Bitcoin halving, which will reduce mining rewards by 50%, have resulted in sector stagnation. According to data compiled by Energyrates.ca, electricity prices per kilowatt hour (kWh) have increased by 1,000% in Alberta, Canada, since 2017. The provincial government has also restricted new cryptocurrency mining projects due to concerns over their power use. \nFor the first nine months of 2023, Hut 8’s revenue fell by 57% year-over-year to CA$ 55,184 ($40,757), largely due to falling Bitcoin prices at the time. In terms of hash rate, Hut 8 currently accounts for 1.3% of the Bitcoin network’s overall processing power.\n On Jan. 19, Hut 8 stock fell by more than 23% in a single day after allegations surfaced from short sellers accusing the company’s partner USBTC of legal trouble in a $725 million merger deal. Hut 8 has since stated that the report \"is filled with inaccuracies, misrepresented data, speculative claims, and unfounded character attacks.\" On February 8, the firm's former CEO, Jaime Leverton, resigned. \nRelated: Bitcoin price retraces from $69K ATH as BTC hodlers take profit",

  "article_detailed_content": "The blockchain ecosystem and popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance revealed its latest move to encourage more women to participate in the industry by blending high-end goods with finance through its new luxury fragrance, Crypto. \nOn March 6, Binance’s female marketing leaders announced their attempts to broaden the company’s inclusivity efforts, focusing on attracting the attention of women with a marketing campaign starring the luxury scent in time for International Women’s Day on March 8.\nThe Crypto fragrance was initially part of a series of luxury advertisements for the company’s inclusivity campaign, “Crypto is Yours.” Binance said the strategy draws “inspiration from the conventions of beauty advertising” while challenging the “norm” of the crypto space.\nRachel Conlan, the chief marketing officer at Binance, said drawing from her own experience in the crypto space, she’s seen the “invaluable contributions” of women firsthand.\n“We’re here to tell women everywhere: Don’t be a bystander. Break those glass ceilings, challenge existing narratives and become part of this digital transformation that’s set to redefine global finance.”\nShe added it’s not just a scent but a message to women that “they have a significant role to play in the crypto revolution.”\nBinance said that the “core component” of the initiative is to encourage more women to explore the crypto industry. It plans to also reward the first 5,000 women who complete one of their beginner crypto courses with $25 in Tether (USDT).\nRelated: Binance temporarily suspends Solana network withdrawals, citing ‘increased volume’\nConlan emphasized that crypto is universal and all individuals should be empowered to participate in the space.\nIn 2023, in the lead up to International Women’s Day, Cointelegraph spoke with Binance’s co-founder He Yi, who, as a woman, advised those looking to get into the space to “forget gender” and focus on mindset to make it in Web3. \nBinance isn’t the only crypto platform seeking to cater to the women demographic in 2024. On Jan. 16, the cryptocurrency exchange Bitget pledged to allocate $10 million to go toward women-led Web3 startups through the Blockchain4Her initiative that promotes gender diversity and inclusivity in the industry.\nAccording to a Jan. 11 report from Bitget Research, women-led or created startups received only $1.77 billion of the $27.85 billion in Web3 venture capital funding between the first quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023, accounting for roughly 6.43%. \nFemale-led Web3 startups comprised less than 9% of all startups in the space, which speaks to the efforts of many of the major industry players to encourage participation by women.\nMagazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby’s: NFT Collector\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

The investment is set to be used in ongoing product developments involving the TON Foundation, Bybit and Ethereum layer 2 Mantle Network.\nThe Telegram Ad Platform, built on the TON blockchain, officially went live in March 2024. The platform allows Telegram channel owners worldwide to receive financial rewards, exclusively selling advertising and sharing revenue with channel owners in Toncoin.\nInformation shared with Cointelegraph outlines Bybit’s increasing involvement in the TON ecosystem over the past year. The cryptocurrency exchange carried out a cashback program and staking involving Toncoin in 2023.\nRelated: Telegram ad platform to launch via TON blockchain\nIt’s understood that around 130,000 users of messaging app Telegram were responsible for generating over $22 million in trading volume through the initiatives.

  "article_detailed_content": "A coordinated approach between His Majesty's Treasury, the Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could help the United Kingdom develop regulations that allow cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to coexist.\nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Varun Paul, who formerly served as the head of Fintech at the BoE, about the U.K.’s efforts to establish regulations that support the use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins while maintaining investor protection and financial stability.\nPaul, now the senior director for CBDCs and financial market infrastructure at Fireblocks, says the U.K. is closing the gap with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which he describes as the most advanced regulatory framework globally.\nRelated: FTX collapse, Binance’s US settlement provide strong case for MiCA regulations\n“There was a period where the FCA said we’re not going to regulate crypto in any way because we don’t want to endorse it. As a result, the U.K. fell behind Europe, but it’s catching up fast,” Paul explains.\nThe U.K. Treasury published its final proposal in October 2023, outlining its plans to regulate the sector, with companies offering cryptocurrency-related activities to be authorized by the FCA.\n“You could see the latest set of publications as trying to position the U.K. level with the EU and encourage innovation so that London is seen as a Fintech center and a crypto hub. It’s recognition that the FCA, Treasury and the Bank of England can’t stay quiet on this subject any longer,” Paul adds.\nAdvantage of coordination\nWhile the U.K. may have been slow in developing a framework that oversees the broader cryptocurrency space and the systemic role of stablecoins, Paul believes the country stands to gain from a cooperative regulatory approach.\nThe Fireblocks CBDC director says the development of regulations has been quicker in the country, given the U.K. does not have to coordinate rules between different states like the EU has had to. The dovetail approach of the Treasury, BoE and FCA has also lent a hand in creating rules that balance fostering innovation and financial stability:\n“Because of the coordination between those three authorities, it has the potential to be more comprehensive in giving a set of rules to facilitate stablecoins, allowing tokenized deposits for banks as well as central bank digital currencies.”\nPaul highlights that the FCA’s regime currently oversees the management and use of stablecoins in the U.K. as well as smaller cryptocurrency and Fintech operators. Meanwhile, “larger, systemically important” operators would fall under the radar of the BoE and its Prudential Regulation Authority.\nStablecoins remain a base asset in the crypto ecosystem\nStablecoins have become an essential cog in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The market capitalization of Tether (USDT) recently surpassed $100 billion, becoming the most-used stablecoin worldwide.\nUSDT’s market capitalization surpassed $100 billion on March 24. Source: CoinMarketCap\nPaul says that dollar-backed stablecoins continue to be used as a gateway to access the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and will remain so until other blockchain-based digital forms of money are available that rival their ubiquity:\n“Europe and the U.K. are saying we need to have a form of money denominated in euros and sterling, and we have the opportunity to say what that looks like.”\nThe transparency of Tether’s reserves for circulating USDT has often been criticized by mainstream commentators, and Paul says this narrative remains a concern for the U.K.’s regulators.\n“From the very outset, the U.K. regime said if you’re going to call yourself a stablecoin, it must be redeemable at par and held in liquid assets. That’s something that the Financial Policy Committee and the Bank of England said many years back,” he adds.\nNevertheless, its policymakers are keenly aware of the demand for cryptocurrencies and digital money that can be used to purchase them, as Paul explains:\n“Let’s have a regime that encourages a safe form of digital assets that’s backed by pounds rather than have a parallel to USDT in the U.K.”\nWhat also needs to be considered is the use cases for stablecoins, tokenized assets and CBDCs between different institutions.\nStablecoins and CBDCs operating in tandem\nPaul authored a white paper published in November 2023 for Fireblocks, which considers the potential of a smart contract-managed system that allows a central bank to issue a CBDC as a base asset for commercial bank tokenized deposits and stablecoins.\nThe paper outlines how a country can have a consistent set of money, which protects and preserves this concept of uniformity. Paul says that users don’t really mind what form of money they’re using, just like they don’t mind today that they’re using banknotes, credit cards or e-money.\nSpecific use cases will ultimately decide between the need for stablecoins and CBDCs. Crypto-natives may feel more comfortable using USDT, while older generations may lean toward centralized digital currencies issued by trusted financial institutions.\n“Some people will be for the most trusted, risk-free money. Others will go for forms of money that allow them to enter DeFi [decentralized finance], for example. Others use a particular digital currency to pay their taxes. For that reason, you will need and see various options integrating and working together,” Paul concludes.\nSpecific use cases will ultimately decide between the need for stablecoins and CBDCs. Crypto-natives may feel more comfortable using USDT, while older generations may lean toward centralized digital currencies issued by trusted financial institutions. \nThe U.K.’s Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami, recently indicated that the government is working toward passing legislation regulating stablecoins and cryptocurrency staking by the end of 2024. \nMagazine: How the digital yuan could change the world… for better or worse",

  "article_detailed_content": "Bitcoin’s (BTC) price recorded a new all-time high of $69,000 on March 5; however, the time above $69,000 was short-lived as the BTC price experienced a flash crash and briefly fell below $60,000. The price crash was attributed to heavy selling from hodlers as several whales and dormant accounts woke up to take profits.\nAccording to data from CryptoQuant, crypto exchanges witnessed a three-day streak of BTC inflows worth $525 million, suggesting traders were moving their BTC from cold storage onto exchanges to take profit in anticipation of the all-time high (ATH).\nOne case that intrigued the crypto community was a dormant whale that awoke after 14 years to deposit 1,000 BTC ($67.1 million) onto Coinbase when BTC’s price was trading at $67,116. The whale mined this Bitcoin in 2010 when the price was below $0.28, suggesting that the whale has made more than $60 million in profit.\nWhile Bitcoin hodlers took profit on their holdings, leverage traders were less lucky, with more than $1 billion in leveraged positions liquidated due to price volatility, making it the largest liquidation day since the previous cycle top.\nRelated: Crypto derivatives’ daily trading volumes reach record highs\nThe Bitcoin binary spending indicator also indicates that several Bitcoin hodlers made a profit as BTC’s price hit $69,000.

The balance between gameplay and blockchain aspects is crucial to onboard players from broader demographics.\nIf the integration of the crypto economy is too shallow, it risks underutilizing the potential benefits, such as digital asset ownership and the ability to trade the items you’ve crafted. Game developers must observe the impact of economic activities on the gaming experience and adjust accordingly to prevent one aspect from diminishing the other.\nAs Web3 gaming evolves and shifts toward better gameplay and interaction, new titles arrive with more advanced features, combining the most popular gaming genres.\nBuilding a game for players\nBig Time Studios, a Web3 game studio, recently concluded the pre-alpha preseason of its flagship title, Big Time — a free-to-play Web3 game. The multiplayer game combines action and role-playing elements reminiscent of Diablo with worlds akin to those in World of Warcraft, offering players a blend of intense combat and vast exploration.\nThrough procedurally generated dungeons, players can engage in battles, complete various objectives and gather resources critical for crafting nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The collectibles are earned directly in-game, emphasizing Big Time’s commitment to a player-centric approach.\nThe invite-only preseason heightened anticipation and laid the groundwork for the game’s progression to closed and open beta phases while incorporating player feedback to refine the gaming experience.\nCrafting a player-first economy\nBig Time’s in-game economy is centered around its native token, BIGTIME. It enables players to earn, refine, craft and upgrade items. Players can expedite crafting times and gain access to Prestige Portals, which offer higher drop rates for in-game collectibles, using BIGTIME tokens.\nBig Time adopts a fair token release strategy, where tokens are earned through gameplay, ensuring a level playing field. It also helps with balanced gameplay by preventing non-players from purchasing their way to in-game advantages.\nBig Time Studios distributed over 250 million BIGTIME tokens to 21,000 users so far. The game saw engagement from more than 68,000 players with an average of 10,000 daily active users. In GAM3S.GG Awards 2023, Big Time brought home three awards, including Best Multiplayer Game, Best RPG and Best Adventure Game.\nThe game also attracted 2,600 Twitch streamers, amassing over 940,000 watched hours on the streaming platform.

He underlined their priority of delivering “an amazing game with immersive gameplay,” adding that:\n“This approach has differentiated us, and in light of its recent successes, signals we’re taking Web3 gaming in the right direction.”\nBig Time is set to expand in 2024 with the introduction of player vs. player (PvP) combat alongside new content, dungeons and character abilities. The expansion marks the game’s initial venture into PvP, featuring high-value portals with exceptional loot and challenges.

  "article_detailed_content": "Astar Network, a blockchain firm based in Japan, launched Astar zkEVM on March 5, becoming the first layer-2 chain to integrate into Polygon’s AggLayer.\nAstar zkEVM is a zero-knowledge layer-2 chain designed to enable cross-chain transactions between the Astar and Polygon blockchains. It’s integrated through AggLayer, a protocol that supports multichain smart contracts via aggregate zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), essentially making the chains seemingly operate for end-users as though they’d merged into a single network.\nAccording to a blog post from Polygon Labs, AggLayer brings “uniform cryptographic security and atomic composability across aggregated chains without sacrificing sovereignty,” which is to say that transactions remain immutable throughout the entire process of crossing chains.\nIn a press release seen by Cointelegraph, Sota Watanabe, founder of Astar Network, said the move came as part of Japan’s national tech strategy:\n“Our integration in the AggLayer and continuous investment in development solidifies Astar zkEVM’s position as Japan’s web3 authority for innovation, entertainment, and retail dApps, positioning Astar at the forefront of Japan’s web3 expansion in the enterprise, retail, and government sectors, accelerating the growth of web3.”\nAs Cointelegraph reported, AggLayer was announced just a little over a month ago with the goal of easing friction for users across chains.\nPolygon Labs compared the result to an end-user experience more in line with the internet. Instead of manually connecting, recovering and restaging assets to facilitate cross-chain movement, AggLayer basically does the connecting and converting behind the scenes. This works much like today’s Web2 experience, where users click on a link and all the handshaking between sites and across domains occurs in the background.\nSandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, said in a statement that the onset of the AggLayer era was an important milestone:\n“Today is an important first step to welcome communities to a seamless multichain ecosystem. With Astar and numerous other ZK-powered chains onboarding soon, Polygon CDK and AggLayer are poised to bring internet-scale capabilities to the world of crypto.”\nRelated: Institutional investors execute on-chain AVAX tokenized loan",

  "article_detailed_content": "After nearly three years, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly recovered to its all-time high above $69,000 on March 5.\n“This is a truly historic moment for the asset and the crypto industry as a whole,” said Kraken managing director Jonathon Miller in an email to Cointelegraph, adding:\n“A combination of factors has sparked excitement around this asset class and contributed to Bitcoin achieving this landmark: the recent U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, renewed focus on the upcoming [Bitcoin] halving event, and a wave of interest in crypto more broadly as mainstream attention has returned.”\nSimilarly, Bitcoin’s 56% year-to-date gain has ignited interest in various memecoins. According to data compiled by Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, altcoins such as Floki and Baby Doge have returned anywhere between 80% to 289% in the past week alone, with an 840% increase in trading volume during the same period.\n“The rapid rise of assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has resulted in a spill-over effect, propelling the entire meme sector upwards,” said Lee. “One significant factor contributing to the surge in these memecoins is their deployment on Ethereum and Solana chains, typically priced in ETH and SOL on decentralized exchange platforms. The upward trend in ETH and SOL prices consequently drives the price appreciation of meme coins.”\nThe same day, Solana memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) saw a wild run-up in anticipation of its Binance listing, with a gain of 400% in the past week alone. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, one trader allegedly made $4.3 million on WIF by spending 20 SOL (SOL) ($1,156) on Nov. 24, 2023, four days after WIF went online.\nWe found that @blockgraze made ~$4.36M on $WIF with only 20 $SOL($1,156), a gain of 3,773x!\n\nHe spent 20 $SOL($1,156) to buy 7.4M $WIF on Nov 24, 2023 (4 days after $WIF went online).\n\nThen sold 5.06M $WIF for $1.09M, with 2.35M $WIF($3.27M) left.https://t.co/zSCaLgF0dI pic.twitter.com/klMEzjXU66\n— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 5, 2024\nDespite high prices, development activity continues to heat up within the Bitcoin ecosystem. As told by Bitcoin venture capital fund 9.Bit, one prominent layer-1 solution on Bitcoin, Bitmap, has created a BRC-420 metaverse protocol native to the network.\n“After purchasing bitmap land, users can buy avatars, pets, game assets, background music from the BRC-420 Marketplace and use them in Bitmap apps,” wrote 9.Bit's founder. Another feature created by Bitmap, Merlin Chain, allows BRC-420 assets to be swapped between nonfungible and fungible tokens. The project currently has a market capitalization of $180 million. \nRelated: What the Bitcoin halving means for the network’s energy consumption concerns",

  "article_detailed_content": "The recent outages at some of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges have mainly been caused by algorithmic trading firms, Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen, the chief strategy officer and technical lead for trading at the dydx exchange, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview.\n“Because there’s so much retail interest and the price action is moving so fast, all of the algorithmic trading firms are vastly increasing the rate of order placements and cancels they want to send to the matching engine to maintain their positions […] It’s common for a trading firm to 20 times the output of orders and cancels at a very busy time.”\nSome of the world’s most prominent exchanges suffered technical issues in the past week, including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and Bybit, just days after Bitcoin breached $60,000 for the first time in over two years on Feb. 28.\n“We do see this pretty much every bull market or every time there’s concentrated retail interest and big price moves,” added Crnkovic-Rubsamen.\nFollowing the temporary outage, investment research firm Citron called for a short sale on Coinbase stock. Its shares rose over 11.36% in the 24 hours leading up to 12:25 pm UTC to trade at $229.15, according to Google Finance data.\nUnlike decentralized exchanges (DEXs), some centralized exchanges could set custom trading limits for individual market makers based on trust assumptions, which contributes to the growing workload under bull market conditions, according to Crnkovic-Rubsamen.\n“[Centralized exchanges] may have one market maker they know really well… and they’ll set their rate limit 10 times higher… That's perfectly reasonable. but then the bull market comes and this market maker wants to trade PEPE 10 times faster and all of a sudden it is a problem that the rate limit for them is way higher.”\nIn contrast, the rate limit on decentralized exchanges is set by the protocol since DEXs have no direct relationships with market makers. Rubsamen added that centralized exchanges can be highly reliable during normal trading but less reliable than DEXs during peak bull market loads.\n“Centralized matching engines are awesome at performance, they’re super optimized and efficient, but when they go down, that’s it […] There is a reliability trade-off there,” Crnkovic-Rubsamen said.\nRelated: Bitcoin market cap reaches a new high, briefly surpassing silver",

  "article_detailed_content": "Significant partnerships with luxury brands and entertainment figures and a focus on developing new experiences and events helped The Sandbox endure a prolonged cryptocurrency bear market.\nCo-founder Sébastien Borget and CEO Arthur Madrid spoke exclusively to Cointelegraph at NFT Paris about renewed interest in the metaverse platform’s native token, new partnerships with the likes of Gucci and Lacoste, and its long-term goals to remain the home of virtual experiences in the Web3 space.\n“People enjoy saying the metaverse is dead, but it’s definitely not for us. For Facebook, it’s not. If you listen to Tim Sweeney at Epic, he is also extremely bullish on the metaverse. Having a metaverse with crypto, with NFTs [nonfungible tokens] and avatars, it’s still very meaningful,” Madrid explains.\nA recent report published by cryptocurrency market intelligence firm Messari highlights a renewed interest in The Sandbox’s (SAND) token and the platform itself. SAND’s circulating market cap increased by 89% to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from $649 million, outperforming the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies in the same quarter.\nMessari State of The Sandbox. Source: Messari on X\nMeanwhile, activities including creating and trading in-game assets and experiences, excluding Sandbox LAND sales, grew significantly. Daily average active non-LAND buyers were up 73%, non-LAND mints grew by 233%, while daily average non-LAND secondary sales and daily average non-LAND secondary volume were up by 173% and 78% respectively in Q4, 2023.\nThe Sandbox also secured new partnerships with luxury brands and companies like Warner Music Group and its Notorious B.I.G avatar collection, Japanese software developer Drecom and Singapore media conglomerate MediaCorp.\nAn eye on new markets\nBorget said the company has a history of building in the depths of cryptocurrency bear markets. The Sandbox was born in 2018 as Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies crashed in the wake of market highs in late 2017.\n“We tried to ship product updates and focus on the creator first to empower them to create new content experiences. Last year we released some major updates, including the opening of publishing on the map and we have thousands of live and playable experiences,” Borget said.\nRelated: Metaverse is dead in the West, but ‘so hot' in Asia: Sandbox co-founder\nThe co-founder added that the sale of in-game assets, including wearables and other nonfungible tokens (NFTs), was not necessarily an indicator of activity or growth of the platform:\n“It doesn’t mean that people have to purchase NFTs all the time for a platform to be active. I think that is what a bear market doesn't really capture well.”\nBorget said The Sandbox has been engaging with creators, companies and brands with a keen focus on Asian markets. The audience in these regions is “more receptive” to Borget and Madrid's vision of Web3 and metaverses.\n“Turkey, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and India have been a growth driver for The Sandbox, even during the bear market, and we were able to sell out all our land sales,” Borget said.\nThe Sandbox carried out eight primary LAND sales in 2023, of which the company retains earnings, and i launched 17 avatar collections. Borget said most of these sales have sold out, indicating continued interest in metaverse experiences for creators and players.\nLong term plans\nA period of resurgence is a positive, but Madrid believes that metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland, which are part of Animoca Brand’s blockchain portfolio, are developing a “fantastic ecosystem” built around native tokens:\n“We are building a solid ecosystem around SAND, with thousands of games that have been built using our tools.”\nMadrid adds that conventional Web2 games like World of Warcraft, Fortnite and Roblox are living proof that successful virtual worlds have longevity that can last for decades.\n“Apart from being Web3 and being attached to digital ownership, it gives us a lot of optimism and certainty about our success. We are also a big company. We did several equity rounds, we have solid cash flow. We are building plans up to 2035,” Madrid said.\nRelated: Here’s how the World Economic Forum leaps into the metaverse — Davos 2023\nThe co-founder adds that their focus on working with brands, artists, musicians and creators has significantly influenced The Sandbox’s success. He contends that Web2 giants like Roblox and Meta’s metaverse experiences are substandard for the resources they command, especially when comparing the narratives presented to users.\nCointelegraph explores The Sandbox’s 2024 Love and Music Festival event, which brings back the Steve Aoki experience in a revamped introductory area. Source: Cointelegraph\nThe platform has worked directly with household names like Snoop Dogg, DJs Steve Aoki, Deadmau5 and BLOND:ISH, as well as with skateboarding icon Tony Hawk, to co-create experiences for fans.\nSimilarly, Madrid says the company works with companies like Adidas and its fanbase, offering SAND rewards to users to collaborate to build experiences like “Adidas Land.” This, in turn, shows these companies the interest and creativity of their Web3 user base.\n“I think what makes The Sandbox special is the narrative. We have a big narrative team and enjoy working with artists. People like Steve Aoki and Jamiroquai tell us that despite being a startup, we go much deeper in terms of emotion and experiences.”\nThe Sandbox has a total of 12 offices around the world, including two locations in Paris and hubs in Latin America, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul. The company employs around 350 people, with more than half of the team responsible for building the technology and tools used to create experiences in the metaverse platform.\nMagazine: Which gaming guild positioned itself best for the bull market?\nExchange or buy SAND\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "AneeMate breathes new life into creature-based gaming by merging PvP mechanics and collection elements. Developed by QORPO, the game offers extensive customization and utilizes NFTs to impact both player experience and the QORPO token economy.\nAdapting the fantastical creature formula to gaming, Pokémon sold over 480 million units worldwide and positioned itself as the third best-selling videogame franchise after Mario and Tetris.\nPokémon’s achievement paved the way for game developers eager to capture a slice of this lucrative market. A testament to this trend is Palworld, a recent entrant that has made waves by attracting 2 million peak players and selling over 5 million copies on Steam within its first three days.\nA fresh take on a $118 billion formula\nCreated by Citizen Conflict developer QORPO, AneeMate introduces a novel approach to creature-based gaming with a twist. It blends various genres into a unified gaming experience, reinventing the Pokémon-inspired adventure with elements of exploration, shooter action and the pursuit of collecting AneeMates.\nAneeMate seeks to distinguish itself from Palworld and other Pokémon-inspired games by emphasizing player-versus-player (PvP) mechanics. The game offers a multiplayer experience reminiscent of QORPO’s hero shooter — Citizen Conflict — marked by intense PvP action and a sense of urgency.\nPlayers must engage in fast-paced combat, craft valuable items and reach extraction zones before time runs out. Beyond its dynamic action, AneeMate fosters social interaction, enabling asset trading and participation in a player-driven economy.\nAneeMates come in multiple shapes, elemental origins and designs. Source: AneeMate\nBy customizing a kid avatar, players start their journey on the Hidden Islands — a constantly expanding group of small islands, each defined by a unique element that shapes its appeal and hazards. AneeMate gives players a 30-minute window to embark on missions to find loot, craft weapons, fight against rivals and capture AneeMates.\nThe game offers an adventure into a realm of myths and tales, embodying the fantasy world every child dreams of. Only teens can enter the Hidden Islands, where players represent young heroes on a quest to save AneeMates.\nFrom generic to iconic: Character customization\nA Harvard Business School study shows that personalization options in gaming significantly increase player engagement and retention. Emphasizing extensive customization options, AneeMate departs from the traditional fixed character designs. Players can customize their character’s appearance with a broad selection of clothing and accessories.\nAneeMate lets players customize their characters with various clothing and accessory choices. Source: AneeMate\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant QORPO Game Studio commits to continually expanding alternatives, keeping the customization choices fresh and appealing.\nEvolving creatures meet NFTs\nAneeMate captivates players with the joy of collecting distinct creatures with different designs and elemental origins. The initial Genesis Collection, featuring 3,333 unique AneeMates, was released last December and sold out immediately. The collection showcased 18 different creatures from the Hidden Islands, designed to evolve into stronger versions as players progress within the game.\nPlayers can keep both the original and the evolved form of AneeMates. Source: AneeMate\nAs AneeMates evolve, players can keep both forms, with the opportunity to mint the evolved version as a potentially highly sought-after nonfungible token (NFT). QORPO claims that creatures featured in this collection won’t be available anywhere else and won’t be obtainable in game.\nUtilizing NFTs for in-game assets reduces the supply of the QORPO token -which was recently listed on ByBit- enhancing its value. QORPO Game Studio’s approach integrates all its products and services with a single studio token, ensuring the token’s value is diversified across various projects.\nLearn more about AneeMate\nDisclaimer.

Tron and Ethereum are the two largest blockchains for USDT, accounting for 51% and 43% of all issued USDT, respectively.\nTop five blockchain networks used by Tether (USDT) as of March 4, 2024. Source: Tether\nDespite relying significantly on blockchains like Tron and Ethereum, USDT exists “independent of blockchains,” Tether’s latest announcement stated, stressing that the blockchains are used “only as a transport layer.”\nTo address the risk that a blockchain could become unresponsive, unreliable or unusable, Tether has established its official recovery tool, which would allow users to migrate USDT between blockchains. The firm noted:\n“Users would be able to verify ownership of their addresses on an unresponsive blockchain and a recipient address on another supported blockchain, and Tether will transfer the USDT between them.”\nAccording to the announcement, affected USDT users will be able to initiate the migration process using the web interface or command-line tools. The process involves cryptographically signing a request for migration to verify ownership of Tether tokens, which are available with browser extension wallets like MetaMask and hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor.\nAdditionally, a command-line interface allows users to input their private key directly, enabling them to sign the necessary message using an open-source script on their local machine, the announcement notes.\nRelated: WSJ faces defamation lawsuit tied to Tether-Bitfinex article\nCointelegraph approached Tether for a comment but at the time of publication had yet to receive a response.\nTether’s recovery tool launch came amid USDT breaking a major milestone in terms of its market value, with the USDT market cap reaching $100 billion on March 4 for the first time in history.\nAt the time of writing, USDT is the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, following Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), which are worth $1.4 trillion and $442 billion, respectively, according to data from CoinGecko.\nTop three cryptocurrencies by daily trading volume.

  "article_detailed_content": "Artists, designers and luxury brands are proving the real-world utility of nonfungible tokens and blockchain technology, with NFT Paris attracting thousands of visitors to France’s capital.\nThe third edition of NFT Paris, hosted in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower at the Grand Palais Éphémère, showcased Web3’s increasing impact on various industries. Cointelegraph was on the ground to speak to individuals at the forefront of the growing intersection of blockchain technology and mainstream adoption.\nPutting the fashion in NFT\nParis is synonymous with fashion, and NFT Paris was no exception. Attendees showcased impeccable taste and style matched with their growing appreciation for the technology driving innovation in the sector.\nBrian Trunzo, vice president and head of business development at Polygon Labs, spoke with Cointelegraph during a walkthrough of the exhibition hall. The former attorney, who also founded a successful fashion brand, now drives the onboarding of fashion brands to Polygon’s Ethereum-scaling layer-2 ecosystem.\nVisitors gather for a fashion show during NFT Paris in February 2024.\nBefore joining Polygon, Trunzo had been consulting for large brands and exploring NFTs and blockchain use cases from 2017 onward. The digital ownership exhibited by Decentraland, CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity, as well as the in-game skins of League of Legends, served as an example of the potential in these virtual environments.\nTrunzo said that while fashion is “known to be an avant-garde and progressive industry,” the reality is that its cogs, from supply chain to design and retail, are decades old, slow and clunky:\n“What captivated the minds of a lot of folks in fashion when it comes to Web3 is their ability to sell new stuff. You can only sell so many shirts or shoes.”\nTrunzo added that the ruthless nature of the business, where growth and margins mean everything, is being disrupted by the idea that brands can sell digital items or digitize and improve processes.\n“It breaks fashion people’s brains. They’re like, ‘We haven’t been able to sell something new since we invented hats.’ That’s kind of like the way they look at it.”\nPolygon has directly engaged with major brands in the United States, Europe and Asia that are building on its infrastructure. Trunzo said Nike has pushed the envelope by developing its own Web3 platform Swoosh.\n“On the back-end side, what LVMH, Prada, OTB and Mercedes are doing there with supply chain and product lifecycle is fascinating. To see an Aura tag inside a store is mind-blowing, knowing this was authenticated on a blockchain,” Trunzo explained.\nRelated: Polygon Labs and Warner Music Group push music industry Web3 evolution\nAura’s technology gives brands access to blockchain digital product passports. While these tags might not make sense to customers now, Trunzo believes this will change as blockchain technology becomes more ubiquitous.\nEmbraced by watchmakers\nPolygon-powered NFT protocol Arianee has established itself as a significant player in the luxury brand space. Its protocol powers product passports and NFT functionality for several of the world’s most prominent brands.\nCointelegraph spoke to Arianee CEO Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel at NFT Paris, who said that the watchmaking industry, in particular, has embraced blockchain-based digital passports. He estimated that by the end of 2024, 30% of premium watches produced and sold worldwide would have on-chain product credentials:\n“Wachmakers like the fact that people can follow the history of the product post-purchase and easily transfer the ownership to someone else while keeping contact with the watch.”\nHurstel said that the protocol was envisioned to create a circular relationship between companies, products and consumers underpinned by privacy-preserving functionality.\nArianee CEO Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel gives a keynote speech during NFT Paris.\n“It’s the Arianee link. It’s this perpetual connection between a brand, an object and its different owners. They are also convinced that tokenized data infrastructure at the intersection of their products and users is the best infrastructure to build,” Hurstel added.\nRelated: Luxury brand blockchain platform Arianee aims to scale, launches L2 on Polygon\nArianee chairman Frédéric Montagnon highlighted a myriad of benefits for brands and customers. Arianee’s app allows users to keep track of an item’s maintenance history and insurance, provenance and previous ownership, and Web3 functionality, such as exclusive access to products or experiences.\nBuilding community\nFashion brands have also looked to take advantage of the community-building aspect of Web3, with metaverse platform The Sandbox a prime example.\nThe Sandbox co-founders Sebastien Borget and Arthur Madrid highlighted more than 10 major fashion brands — including the likes of Gucci, Lacoste, LVMH and Adidas — that have rewarded customers with digital assets and NFTs.\n“They see The Sandbox as a platform for loyalty, engagement, community building and capturing their attention through all the earned media they generate on social media and the attention time they get from our audience,” Borget said.\nMadrid added that Web3 also serves as an emerging avenue for young fashion designers to explore disruptive ways of launching products and engaging their audiences. Whether it is launching NFTs, art, digitized collections, or metaverse-based experiences or collectibles.\nMagazine: Singer Vérité’s fan-first approach to Web3, music NFTs and community building",

  "article_detailed_content": "Asset management firm VanEck will look to emulate the success of its recently launched Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States with a new self-custody nonfungible token (NFT) platform to explore the potential of tokenized digital asset ownership. \nCointelegraph spoke exclusively to Matthew Bartlett, VanEck’s NFT community and Web3 head, ahead of the launch of SegMint at NFT Paris. The NFT asset management platform allows users to vault and fractionalize digital assets by issuing keys that will be tradable on the platform’s in-house exchange.\nVanEck, the first U.S. asset manager to file for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in 2017, has garnered a reputation as a traditional finance firm actively exploring cryptocurrency ETFs and digital asset ownership.\nVanEck’s NFT “degen”\nBartlett’s mandate as the firm’s NFT and Web3 head is partly thanks to his personal interest in the space. Coupling nearly two decades of experience split between TradFi players Franklin Templeton and VanEck with his love of NFTs, Bartlett was given the go-ahead to build an in-house platform for NFT ownership and digital asset fractionalization.\n“Jan van Eck said I want you to build something, but he didn’t know I was an NFT degen, so I had to start there. I put on my cap as a user and looked at the problems I encountered, figured out what they were, and that’s how we formed the thesis of what we built,” Bartlett explains.\nMatthew Bartlett on stage at NFT Paris in February 2024. Source: Cointelegraph\nVanEck’s Web3 lead became an NFT buyer in 2017 and dabbled in the space, minting and auctioning in Decentraland. Bartlett also helped VanEck take its first steps in the space with a free NFT giveaway that served as a real-world ticket to bell ringing ceremonies at the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.\nOver the past seven years, the firm has been building what Bartlett describes as a robust digital asset team, mainly consisting of cryptocurrency investment analysts and digital asset product managers.\nTesting the “lock and key” NFT model\nSegMint joins an array of platforms offering NFT minting, trading and management. With that in mind, Bartlett sought to build a platform primarily focused on shared ownership and fractionalization of assets.\n“As I started looking at all of the platforms out there that exist, they all sort of suffer from at least three problems. Firstly, they’re custodial in nature. They say, ‘Here are your fractions, but we’re going to take your asset.’ Now you’ve lost out on airdrops or token-gated access,” Bartlett said.\nRelated: EU remains skeptical of crypto investments despite Bitcoin ETF fever — VanEck Europe CEO\nAccording to Bartlett, SegMint maintains users’ self-custody of digital assets by providing vaults owned by their Web3 wallet:\n“It’s still self-custody. So now you get to also manage all of the consumptive utilities, your airdrops, your gameplay and once you lock it, you can mint any number of SegMint keys.”\nSegMint keys are ERC-1155 tokens, meaning they’re fungible clones of whatever is in the users’ vaults. A vault owner needs to own all the respective keys to unlock it, and keys will be tradable on the platform’s closed exchange.\nRelated: Bitcoin won’t be beaten as digital store of value: VanEck CEO\nSegMint launched on Feb. 28 and requires users to go through a Know Your Customer process to create vaults and keys and launch NFTs. Bartlett said he hoped that the platform would attract the likes of CryptoPunks, Squiggles and Pudgy Penguin owners to fractionalize their NFTs. He said:\n“It’s wishful thinking, but that is where we would start. Now you can democratize access to the best collections at a lower price point for people globally.”\nThe potential of tokenized real estate\nA longer-term goal is for SegMint to build partnerships with other blockchain-based platforms that tokenize real-world assets like vintage wines and luxury watches. Tokenized real estate is another prospect Bartlett sees as having high potential for fractionalized ownership in the coming years.\nBartlett envisions a separate platform that could tap into blockchain technology for a range of real estate use cases. An example would be “vaulting” a vacation home to create 52 keys for each week of the year that could be traded on an open marketplace.\n“You’ve got sort of like a disrupter between Airbnb and timeshares where now I’ve got that key, I show up to your house. I hit the RFID reader, and I’m in for the week.”\nThis lofty hypothetical example could be replicated for a variety of high-value assets, from private jets to collectible cars. While Bartlett believes it’s an intriguing model, he admits that these types of use cases may take years to come to fruition.\n“It’s going to take time for the community to figure out the best use cases, and we haven’t even scratched the surface. Right now, I’m in my confined box of what’s regulatory compliant now,” Bartlett admits.\nVanEck’s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $272 million in investments since it was given the green light by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2024. Meanwhile, VanEck Europe’s Bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded products are also attracting interest from investors keen on diversifying their portfolios to add exposure to the cryptocurrency sector.\nMagazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby’s: NFT Collector",

At least $290 million alone was pilfered from PlayDapp, along with $26 million from FixedFloat and $9.7 million from Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff Zirlin.\n#PeckShieldAlert Hackers stole ~$360.83m across over 21 attacks in February 2024, marking a MoM increase of 97.6% compared to January 2024.

Great for users wanting to audit the code but also opens opportunities for bad actors who can “analyze the scripts for vulnerabilities and plan exploits well in advance.”\n“Research about the platforms and DeFi protocols before engaging with them,” Jardine said. “Understand their security features and strategy, and look for updates from the platform on how they are enhancing these.”\nCheck, then check again\nIn 2023, over 324,000 crypto users were hit by phishing scams, with around $295 million lost, Scam Sniffer analysis shows.\nThe anti-scam platform told Cointelegraph that “social media has the most scam links,” noting that malicious websites are often linked in advertisements on these platforms.\nBeosin security researcher Pan Tao warned that phishing attacks advertised on X disguised as Ethereum staking and token airdrops “have been frequent and effective recently.”\nOn Feb. 25, phishing attackers compromised the X account of MicroStrategy and stole at least $440,000, draining wallets in a scam token airdrop.\nThe attacker reportedly directed users to a look-alike website, microsfrategy.com.\nA screenshot of the faked MicroStrategy website replaced the T in the firm’s name with an F. Source: X\nScam Sniffer said users should always verify that the website URL is correct from multiple sources and understand what a contract does before they sign a transaction.\nMeanwhile, Tao warned that drainer-as-a-service tools — such as those used in the fake airdrop — have become a “mature and convenient phishing tool,” and attackers are known to advertise scams on Google and X.\nHaving safe CEX\nBeosin’s Tao said that many new crypto users will buy their first digital assets on a centralized exchange (CEX) owned and operated by one entity.\nAt the same time, there have been “several CEX scams,” including the theft of customer funds by FTX and the alleged fraud by JPEX on its users.\nTao suggested the criteria for choosing a secure, centralized exchange should start with ensuring it’s licensed “or at least publishes its proof of reserves periodically.”\nIt also must have “no withdrawal issues or high withdrawal fees” along with “timely customer support and clear responses.”\nGuard those private keys\nDeFi protocols should ensure their security efforts cover vulnerabilities on and off the blockchain, Jardine said.\nOn-chain vulnerabilities — such as in smart contracts — “drove the majority of DeFi hacking activity in 2023,” Jardine noted. “This changed through the year with compromised private keys driving a larger share of hacks in the second half of the year,” he added.\nRelated: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developers\n“The key takeaway for DeFi protocols is that their security efforts should cover more than just on-chain vulnerabilities and smart contracts, especially amid the rise in off-chain vulnerabilities.”\nProjects can create systems to monitor on-chain activity for potential vulnerabilities, Jardine suggested.\nHe noted some firms offer products that can alert and react to cyberattacks, helping secure third-party integrations and “communicate with customers who might be at risk.”\nJardine said Chainalysis has seen improved DeFi protocol security practices and highlighted losses from protocol hacks dropped about 64% year-on-year to $1.1 billion for 2023.\nMagazine: How to protect your crypto in a volatile market — Bitcoin OGs and experts weigh in",

  "article_detailed_content": "The United Kingdom government recently released statutory instrument documentation stating that U.K. law enforcement authorities will be able to freeze crypto assets used in crime without requiring a conviction from the end of April.\nPublished on Feb. 29, the document outlines the amendments made to the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, which expands the power of the National Crime Agency to confiscate and seize crypto assets the agency suspects are linked to suspicious illicit activities, without needing to go through extensive legal procedures.\nThe Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. Source: U.K. parliament\nAdditionally, authorities will be able to retrieve crypto assets directly from exchanges and custodian wallet providers. They will also have the option to destroy crypto assets if needed.\nWhile it didn’t outline its process, the most common way to destroy a crypto token is by burning it, transferring the tokens to a burn wallet address and taking them out of circulation.\nThe law will take effect on April 26.\nIn September 2022, Cointelegraph reported that the passed legislation aims to expand authorities’ ability to crack down on the use of crypto in crimes like cybercrime, scams and drug trafficking.\nRelated: UK could pass stablecoin, staking laws within six months: Report\nOne of the provisions of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill allows the recovery of crypto assets used in crimes without making an arrest first, as some individuals may avoid conviction by remaining overseas.\nHowever, a British national who was a victim of crypto fraud, losing approximately $46,000 to scammers, declared that U.K. authorities may be “ill-equipped to handle crypto crimes against U.K. residents.”\nHe claimed that the agency failed to take appropriate measures to retrieve his stolen funds.\nMeanwhile, the U.K. government intends to pass new laws regulating stablecoins and crypto staking within the next six months.\nDuring a crypto event hosted by Coinbase in London on Feb. 19, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami disclosed that the government is aiming to complete regulation before the next election, which is set to happen no later than Jan. 28, 2025.\n“We’re very clear that we want to get these things done as soon as possible.

  "article_detailed_content": "Crypto appears to be in a bull market, perhaps not by a technical definition, but most of the attendees at ETHDenver would agree that it sure feels like it. \nEven Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin believes that things are looking up for crypto, and he’s convinced that the best is yet to come.\nOn Feb. 29, Lubin joined the “What will drive the next super cycle” fireside chat moderated by Axios reporter Crystal Kim, and during the conversation, Lubin touched on the current “super cycle,” whether or not a spot BTC and ETH ETF are good for retail investors and the more developer-focused community and the growing need for decentralization in multiple industries.\nWhen asked what would catalyze the next super cycle — a long period of economic expansion that is typically driven by strong growth in the demand for products and services — Lubin said,\n“We are in this 4th turning, and we are ready for a new system of the world. The other way of thinking about it is that it’s a monetary super cycle, where the monetary systems of the world reach and end of life essentially, basically because of interest, and there’s too much debt in the system because certain generations broke the monetary system and other elements of the financial system.”\nLubin explained that “crypto was born into an era of free money. It was born of an era of constrained money, controlled money, top-down command and control. Essentially, we for millennia have been living in a paradigm of centralized top-down trust and its authorities imbue intermediaries with certain powers and the intermediaries help run the world, they maintain these databases or ledgers that control who owns what and who has rights and privileges.”\nAccording to Lubin,\n“Satoshi invented decentralized trust as opposed to centralized trust. We’d never seen decentralized trust on the planet before.”\nAre spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs good for the community?\nBefore spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, crypto advocates and investors had waited more than 7 years for an approval, and while their launch may be the validation stamp that authenticates BTC’s status as a sound investment, there have always been concerns that institutional investors could dilute the true vision of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhen asked whether a spot Bitcoin ETF and the possibility of an ETH ETF were good for the community, Lubin said, “there are a lot of different issues in there, but in the near term, it’s a great thing.”\n“The floodgates are open now, and there’s an enormous amount of value piling into the crypto ecosystem. The good thing about that is it’s going to be hard for regulators and politicians to stomp on people’s portfolios, and we’re going to see more and more funding come into our ecosystem.”\nRelated: SEC’s Hester Peirce wants more decentralization in the financial system\nCan crypto thrive in the U.S.?\nHistorically, regulators and politicians in the U.S. have taken a pretty firm stance against the crypto industry, and many believe that this has hampered the sector’s growth for years. When asked if crypto can “thrive” in the U.S., Lubin suggested that the decision to obstruct the growth of the crypto industry may not be in the hands of policymakers anymore.\n“I think the momentum is picking up, and it's unstoppable. The SEC has done some things under the Biden administration that are real headscratchers, there’s an element of gaslighting and an element of unreasonableness in some of the actions that they have brought, and the judicial branch has been wonderful in seeing things clearly and making sure the laws of the United States of America and the Constitution are followed and protected.”\nLubin ended with,\n“I look forward to a more decentralized governance in the United States”",

  "article_detailed_content": "As the bankrupt FTX exchange prepares to settle obligations to creditors affected by its 2022 collapse, it has cautioned the public about its sole authorized investment manager.\nIn an X post on March 1, FTX said the sale of digital assets by FTX Debtors mandated by the bankruptcy court is solely managed by Galaxy Asset Management, the authorized investment manager. “Several non-authorized third parties are attempting to solicit bids from buyers on behalf of the FTX Debtors,” the former exchange stated.\nScreenshot of FTX’s announcement on X social platform. Source: FTX/X\nIn addition, FTX explained that if the FTX Debtors sell locked digital assets, the terms and conditions governing the schedule for unlocking the holdings would still stand. The bankrupt exchange has actively worked on restructuring and repaying its creditors in recent months. The platform has recovered assets totaling $7 billion, which it is using to repay former customers.\nFTX obtained approval from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in a Feb. 22 hearing to sell its stake of over $1 billion in the artificial intelligence (AI) firm Anthropic.\nRelated: SBF sentencing: Letters highlight efforts to recover FTX funds\nThis came after amotion filed by FTX to sell its 7.84% Anthropic stake. FTX first invested about $530 million into the AI startup in April 2022, months before it collapsed and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November of that year.\nIn December 2023, FTX debtors proposed claimants receive reimbursement based on the prices of crypto assets at the time of bankruptcy.\nFTX creditors, in turn, proposed “in kind” repayments for crypto holdings. However, Judge John Dorsey sided with the debtors, saying in a Jan. 31 ruling that the law was “very clear” on the matter.\nA jury found former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried guilty of seven charges in his criminal trial on Nov. 3, 2023, including wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, commodities fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. His sentencing is expected on March 28, where he will face a maximum sentence of 110 years in prison.\nMagazine: Can you trust crypto exchanges after the collapse of FTX?",

  "author": {

  },
  "article_detailed_content": "The discussion around real-world assets (RWAs) is heating up at an explosive pace. In Web3 context, RWA defines a digital twin of a traditional asset -such as real estate, art or commodities- stored on a blockchain network. Naturally, it opens up vast opportunities for businesses that benefit from migrating from physical to digital.\nWhen talking about traditional “assets,” the initial focus of the RWA trend, the travel industry might not be the first line of business that springs to one’s mind since it’s more about providing an “experience” than digitized or tradeable assets. However, this $850 billion industry is shaping to become the RWA transformation’s torchbearer.\nBut how?\nMost digital technologies the travel industry has been functioning on were “borrowed” from other industries. With the introduction of Camino Network, the global industry finally has the chance to build and control its own infrastructure. From communication to e-commerce, it has come a long way from “writing airline tickets by hand and conducting reservations by telex” to using blockchain networks for better communication and faster payments, according to Thomas Stirnimann, the chairman of the Camino Network Foundation.\nStirnimann, a travel industry expert and visionary, is the current chairman and owner of Alpha Golf Travel AG. He previously held key roles as CEO and board member of Hotelplan Holding AG. Priorly, Stirnimann spent over 20 years with Kuoni Travel Holding AG, where he was responsible for the Swiss, Scandinavian and Greek markets. The chairman of the Camino Network Foundation was also responsible for Travelhouse and initiated the founding of Edelweiss Airways.\nStirnimann brought his decades of experience in travel and hospitality to blockchain space with Camino Network. Meaning “path” or “way” in Spanish, Camino is a layer-1 blockchain specifically developed to address the needs of the travel industry. “From the beginning, we, the founders, knew it would be a journey,” he noted, “Because we all come from the travel industry and clearly see both perspectives and bottlenecks.”\nHighlighting the fragmentation in the travel ecosystem, Stirnimann explained that almost every travel vertical has its own set of solutions. “It is very hard to imagine a more fragmented industry than travel,” he added. Some have the legacy infrastructure, while others do better to keep up with the tech evolution. “However, many of these verticals must communicate with each other to cover travelers’ needs,” he explained in an exclusive interview.\nTravel industry bottlenecks\nAPI, short for application programming interface, is the “magical word” here. It has enabled interoperability between different stakeholders of the travel business and, as a result, provides a seamless experience for travelers. However, fast forward to today, it is “all the times expensive, many times unreliable and always in need of maintenance.”\nCamino Network was born from the vision of providing a reliable, shared and affordable system that belongs to businesses from within the travel industry itself. A system designed to simplify and reduce the cost of travel operations. The inherent transparency, traceability and immutability of blockchain helps fight against fraud plaguing the key processes of the travel industry, such as ticketing and payment fraud.\n“Camino Network is a travel industry sandbox. We are bringing travel companies together like never before. Our community actually owns and decides on future changes and developments.”\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThis environment helps simplify complex processes like settlements, payments and verifications, Stirnimann continued. “With clear travel standards, developers can switch from maintaining countless APIs to actually developing innovative, consumer-focused products.”\nCamino Network lays a solid foundation for the travel industry to operate and communicate on blockchain, and tokenized RWAs are a key step in their vision. Stirnimann exemplified asset tokenization with the booking process, stating that key components of the process -such as airplane seats or room nights- can become simpler and more straightforward with blockchain. Tokenized requests will be sent from wallet to wallet to request tokenized assets. Tokenization also brings security and transparency when making last-minute changes and cancellations, further reducing fraud.\nConversations have already started about dynamic pricing models and personalized offers in the travel tech community, and the Camino Network Foundation chairman believes that Web3 will enable new pricing models that adapt in real time to changes in demand and supply.\nFrom what Stirnimann emphasized, the main benefit of RWA tokenization in the travel industry boils down to getting closer to “real time” and increasing operational efficiency, which is direly needed. Because, in its current state, huge-scale facilities like hotels and airports are operated by a myriad of different systems that are barely connected, he explained. Managing key travel facilities would become much easier with real-time data and efficiency.\nReal-world assets, real-world benefits\nTurning each component of the travel business into a tradeable asset opens up doors for a wave of new investors, earning a big win for the whole industry. Tokenization can break down high-value travel assets, like hotels or even cruise liners, into smaller, purchasable tokens, according to Stirnimann.\nRegulations stand as the tricky part in the equation of implementing innovation for real-world use. Travel is global, and there is a high chance that legislation differs from departure to destination in one flight. Stirnimann takes a rather realistic approach here and admits that while Camino Network is built as the most interoperable and compliant network, there is much homework to do due to the “conservative” nature of the travel industry.\n“Security and trust within the Web3 travel ecosystem is of high priority. Plus, we are keeping in mind the complexities of tax laws and respecting privacy regulations like GDPR and other international rules to keep everything smooth for the worldwide community.”\nThe Camino Network Foundation, the Swiss-based nonprofit that drives the development of the Camino Network ecosystem, is mindful of securities laws to build compliant solutions across different regions, he explained. “It’s crucial for Camino Network to bring innovation to the industry responsibly.”\nTokenized RWA applications in travel\nWhen asked about the low-hanging fruits of RWA tokenization in the travel industry, Stirnimann told the good news that there are already some ideas being utilized by a number of businesses — both startups and large-scale companies.\nOne notable application in development by the members of the Web3 travel ecosystem is the tokenization of vacation properties, which shows how easily properties can be tokenized, according to Stirnimann. Similarly, the hotel industry is exploring tokenization to enhance reservation systems and open up secondary market opportunities.\nAnother major component of the travel experience is everything that is bookable, like airline, train and bus seats, where tokenization enables e-ticketing in the form of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, the main steps of travel, such as hotel nights and airline seats, can be easily tied to attractions like scuba diving or a segway tour thanks to on-chain communication, Stirnimann explained.\nMembership and loyalty programs can also benefit from converting points into digital tokens, adding value and convenience.\nCamino Network continues to grow with new supporters from the travel industry. Source: Camino Network\nWith its layer-1 blockchain designed by a team of travel tech experts, Camino Network -the first blockchain infrastructure owned by businesses from the travel industry- stands at the pole position to lead RWA tokenization in the travel space. “It is a secure place where all participants are verified. Thus, the companies can trust the network,” explained Stirnimann, adding that this trust is one of the keys to kicking off the tokenization process for assets like hotel rooms, airline seats and vacation rentals.\n“By focusing on interoperability and compliance, Camino Network ensures that all the assets can be seamlessly integrated and traded across different platforms and jurisdictions. With a community-driven approach, we work closely with industry partners to set standards and practices that benefit all stakeholders and the network.”\nNo more ‘funny internet money’\nThe Camino Network Foundation chairman drew a future projection where new trends emerge at the intersection of blockchain technology and the travel industry. “Firstly, we will see an increasing interest in companies in tokenized assets,” Stirnimann argued, “As we see, more and more regulators start considering digital assets as ‘real’ and not just funny internet money.” This will lead to clear legislation and frameworks that will shape the travel industry’s digitalization process, he added.\n“To predict the trends now is the same as predicting the trends of the early internet in 1995,” he summarized, “Camino Network is a new blue ocean for the travel industry.”\nFind out more about Camino Network\n#Blockchain\n#Travel\n#Business\n#Assets\n#Adoption\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "Coinbase is building two new wallet solutions focused on integration and balance transfer across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) applications, targeting developers’ onboarding to its layer-2 blockchain, Base.\nAmong the new solutions is a smart wallet that allows users to take their balances with them in different EVM-compatible applications integrated with the Coinbase Wallet SDK. The second feature is an embedded wallet that enables developers to incorporate noncustodial white-labeled wallets into their applications.\nAccording to Coinbase, both features are designed to minimize developers’ pain points regarding user experience when building Web3 products.\n“We’ve learned a lot from our customers in the past year, and we’ve been working a lot to improve the product experience of all of the services, and where we’ve arrived at is the Embedded Wallets. So, it’s been really a continuous effort for the past year,” Yuga Cohler, senior engineering manager at Coinbase Embedded Wallets, told Cointelegraph.\nThe move expands Coinbase’s wallet-as-a-service product line, a model that allows developers to integrate digital wallets into their own applications without needing to develop the core technology from scratch. This type of solution helps companies looking to incorporate digital assets into their products and offerings.\n“Just to contrast this with the self-custodial wallet model. [...] If you go to a DApp like Uniswap or OpenSea, you generally have to have a Chrome extension, or you have to visit it on your own custodial app. [...] And so what we’re trying to do is provide APIs that allow these DApps to create wallets on behalf of their users, but still in a native way, so they don’t have to go outside of the DApp.”\nWallet-as-a-service is a popular offering in the crypto space. Crypto custodian BitGo, for example, has a similar service that includes custodial and noncustodial wallets available for enterprises.\nBoth BitGo’s and Coinbase’s solutions are powered by multiparty computation (MPC) technology, which enables multiple participants to compute a result based on their private data without revealing it to one another or to an outside party.\n“This technology does not use smart contracts. The cryptography of MPC happens entirely off-chain. And it’s a protocol, there are many different MPC protocols. Coinbase has one that we use in-house,” explained Cohler.\nCoinbase recently dropped support for native Bitcoin (BTC) from its merchant payment platform, Coinbase Commerce, citing difficulties in delivering recent updates to its EVM payment protocol for the cryptocurrency.\nAdditional reporting by Helen Partz.\nMagazine: DeFi’s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "Starknet’s network activity continues to fall despite revisions to its controversial token unlock schedule.\nFor the second time since Starknet announced its provisions airdrop on Valentine’s Day, active users fell below 100,000 addresses, reaching around 43,000 on March 1, according to Starkscan data.\nMeanwhile, transactions per second declined to 1.90 from the peak of 12.3 observed on airdrop day.\nThe Ethereum layer-2 network started airdropping over 700 million STRK tokens to 1.3 million eligible wallets on Feb. 20, causing an immediate surge in daily user count to over 380,000.\nStarknet subsequently faced public backlash due to a planned unlocking event of 1.3 billion tokens for early investors and contributors on April 15, less than two months after the token’s trading debut.\nStarknet responded by adjusting its token release schedule. Now, 64 million tokens will be released on April 15, with the remainder to be gradually unlocked until March 2027.\nAnchit Goel, head of listings at Bitrue — one of the crypto exchanges that listed STRK on airdrop day — tells Cointelegraph that the initial plan would have increased the token supply and piled on to the “selling pressure” from early investors and contributors. \n“This change helps maintain a more stable token value and reduces the risk of rapid price fluctuations,” Goel tells Magazine.\nThe airdrop pushed STRK to a high of $7 on Binance, but it has fallen to $1.87 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.\nAlthough Starknet Foundation’s revised token release schedule has quelled some community concerns about what could have been a massive token dump, it hasn’t been enough to stop the network’s leaking engagement metrics.\nStarkWare did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.\nThe X factors\nTwo of Starknet’s major backers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Alameda Research, are bankrupt. Market watchers have highlighted that investors should consider that the two firms’ bankruptcy proceedings can add selling pressure to the market.\nRecent: Murder by (smart) contract: Ari Juels publishes crypto thriller\nBlockchain data shows that 3AC liquidator Teneo owns the eighth-largest STRK account, with 134.18 million tokens worth around $256 million.\nUnlike 3AC, there is no record of Alameda-associated wallets, including FTX, receiving STRK tokens, according to data platform Spot On Chain.\nThe decentralized quest\nThe project’s token allocation strategy shows that the Starknet Foundation has set aside 18% for the community through rebates and provisions.\nThe rest of the tokens will be controlled by the Starknet Foundation and investors, potentially tipping the network’s governance and voting power to one side.\nStylianos Kampakis, a tokenomics auditor at blockchain security firm Hacken, tells Cointelegraph that centralization is a common issue for early projects. \n“You start with investors and the insiders. Then, it’s possible that token allocation can get more decentralized over time,” says Kampakis.\nAmid these discussions on token allocation and centralization, the project’s approach to its token generation event (TGE) has also come under scrutiny.\nHeld in November 2022, the TGE took place over a year before the broader public could access the cryptocurrency, sparking criticism that this approach benefits insiders or early investors.\nThis is ridiculous.\nThey released the token in 2/2024 but chose the time to release the TGE token as 11/2022 so that they could sell 15.1% of the token early, which normally would have to be locked for 1 year.#STRK #Starknet https://t.co/te6W0NJqG8\n— Will NG X (@WillngX) February 15, 2024\nBitrue’s Goel argues that it is not uncommon for modern projects to hold a TGE before exchange listings, as it allows projects to develop their technology and establish partnerships before going public.\n“However, considering the current dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, this delayed launch could contribute to uncertainty and reduced investor confidence,” adds Goel.\nHunters and gatherers\nStarknet’s recent provisions airdrop was one of the largest in history and joined the growing list of projects opting for the token distribution method over initial coin offerings.\n“I still think the ICO was the easiest way to raise money, but regulation killed this,” Kampakis says.\n“Moving forward, we’re going to be seeing more and more airdrops,” he adds.\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Starknet’s distribution event may have also been flooded by “airdrop hunters.”\nUsers qualified for the airdrop by making five transactions worth $100 or more, holding 0.005 Ether (ETH) as of Nov. 15, 2023, and being active for at least three months.\nStarknet said it designed its eligibility criteria to exclude “Sybil” behavior, which is the creation of multiple accounts to exploit the provisions airdrop.\nBut it appears that some airdrop hunters bypassed Starknet’s Sybil restrictions.\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain claims that an individual entity received more than 1.4 million tokens (worth around $3 million) in the airdrop event through 1,361 wallets.\nMeanwhile, other community members expressed discontent that the criteria may have prevented them from receiving airdrops for contributing to nurturing the network.\nRecent: Energy-efficient miners in US less likely to be impacted by Bitcoin halving\nMoody Salem, the founder of Starknet-based decentralized exchange Ekubo, said on X that 414 of the 1,000 top contributors received no rewards:\n“These are all active, productive individual users of Starknet.”\nAt least 450.5 million STRK tokens of the over 700 million allocated to the airdrop have been claimed, according to Starknet data platform Voyager.\nStarknet has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with 900 million (9%) STRK tokens allocated to the provisions program.\nWhile the Starknet Foundation is expected to hold future provisions airdrops that can include community members left out, less than 200 million tokens are left for distribution under the provisions program.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

Nokia anticipates a 22%–25% increase in network demand from 2022 through 2030. Federico Guillén, president of network infrastructure at Nokia, attributed the rise to the recent mainstream introduction of generative AI and virtual reality devices.\nThe network and digital economy interplay. Source: Nokia\nThe company’s strategy involves investing heavily in its portfolio of network equipment and services over the coming years. The Internet of Value is one of the six ecosystems Nokia will cater to, focusing on decentralization, blockchain and smart contracts. Nokia’s focus on the metaverse will be on human augmentation, spatial computing and split processing.\nThe remaining ecosystems include AI, Industry 5.0, Application Programming Interface (API) economy and Cloud continuum.\nRelated: Here’s a list of countries that love the metaverse the most\nIn 2022, Nokia set up two labs to study the metaverse and the technologies that underpin the ecosystem and experimented with several industrial and wide-scale metaverse initiatives in 2023.\nNokia has developed a future network architecture built on network digital twin technology. A digital twin is a simulation of a physical object, primarily used for prototyping and testing in manufacturing, construction and similar industries. In South Australia, Nokia has been using the metaverse to potentially assist Cessna aircraft technicians at remote airports.\n“We had a 5G connected Microsoft HoloLens, and we were able to instruct people on how to service a Cessna using augmented reality in this case,” said Robert Joyce, chief technology officer of Nokia Oceania, to Cointelegraph in 2023.\nSeparately, a pair of scientists in Finland experimented with digital twins called “Metahumans” to showcase the potential of the metaverse to gamify employee management as opposed to a traditional optimization program. The paper stated:\n“A MetaHuman goes beyond the visual representation, including internal traits of the person it represents, such as their emotions and cognitive states.”\nIn a real-world scenario, data collected via digital twins in industrial simulations can be used to determine optimum work strategies for live teams, new safety measures and potential performance and output.\nMagazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby’s: NFT Collector\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Markets Outlook newsletter\nWeekly newsletter that covers the main factors influencing Bitcoin’s price and the week ahead.

Onanuga said Binance would destroy the Nigerian economy if not stopped because it arbitrarily fixes foreign exchange rates.\nThe P2P feature allows users, buyers and sellers to trade without involving a third party. It became popular in Nigeria in 2021 following the government’s ban on its thriving crypto industry during former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.\nScreenshot of a Binance user complaint on the X platform.

A few days later, Binance set a limit on the selling price of Tether (USDT) tokens on its P2P platform, leaving traders unable to sell USDT above 1,802 naira per USDT.\nHowever, contrary to speculation by the local crypto community, the exchange explained that the price peg was due to an automatic system pause.\nRelated: Nigerian central bank head criticizes Binance, execs reportedly arrested\nBinance is under increased scrutiny in Nigeria as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) expressed concerns about “suspicious flows” of funds through Binance Nigeria in 2023.

  "article_detailed_content": "HyperCycle, an early-stage ledgerless blockchain project that connects artificial intelligence (AI) machines to share resources, has signed up 347,000 computational nodes to the network, according to CEO Toufi Saliba.\nEach node only costs around $1,000 at present, so that’s not a huge amount in dollar value, but the project was founded to become “the internet of AI” and to one day decentralize artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nSingularityNET founder Ben Goertzel is the chief AI scientist for the project, which he developed because no existing blockchain is able to provide the speed and coordination required for AI. HyperCycle uses the Toda communication protocol, proof-of-reputation and modified proof-of-work, as well as Cardano’s Hydra.\n\"Each and every transaction, by the way, is getting into finality in about 300 milliseconds,” Saliba told Cointelegraph during an interview at the Beneficial AGI Summit in Panama this week.\nHyperCycle CEO Toufi Salibi in Panama. \nPicking up on the theme of the conference, Saliba warned that AGI could quickly transform itself into a superintelligence providing a vast amount of power to any centralized company or authoritarian country that develops it first.\n“It would be the worst thing that ever happened to humanity,\" said Saliba, who has been working in AI for over a decade and is convinced that decentralized governance is the only safe way to create a beneficial AGI.\nSo, that’s the wildly ambitious aim that justifies the “hype” part of the HyperCycle name. For now, it’s a business-to-business play concentrating on hooking up AI businesses. HyperCycle nodes contain a virtual machine, transaction machine and AI machine that enable an average of 150 AI agents per node to interact and transact with one another.\nSaliba used the example of an optical character recognition (OCR) AI app encountering text in the 3,000-year-old Aramaic language. It could call on an AI service that specializes in Aramaic OCR, pay it via a smart contract microtransaction, and use the service instantly, almost as if it were part of its own application.\nHe said HyperCycle has a well-known large deepfake video app using the network. On a recent podcast, he revealed he’d met with Nvidia to discuss the “internet of AI” concept. He told Cointelegraph that he can’t comment further on the meeting.\nSaliba explained that companies installing the nodes don’t care about crypto or saving humanity, they just want to make money from their AI agents or reduce their own vast AI compute costs.\n“People don’t even care about decentralization. Most of those companies are existing AI companies. All they care about is ‘show me how I can reduce my $200,000 bill to $120,000.’”\nIf the network can scale up — and that’s an open question since it is relatively new — one exciting but so far completely theoretical possibility is that connecting AIs to work in concert may itself be a path to AGI. Saliba believes the network itself may be a way to achieve AGI as an emergent property, where the sum of the AIs on the network is greater than the component parts.\nSaliba used the metaphor of a giant brain, where each AI node is a neuron that can fire together. “The more you have those propagated across the globe, the more likely that the AGI is achieved by utilizing all of those neurons,” he said.\n“So, in that approach, the entire world has a much higher chance to get to AGI as a single entity.”\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Cointelegraph Research Newsletter\nSelect the Cointelegraph newsletters to which you would like to subscribe to receive the latest news and analysis directly from our team.

Thank you to all of our customers for your patience today,” the exchange wrote in a follow-up message on Feb. 29. \nSince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, Coinbase has become the world’s fourth-largest publicly-traded asset exchange, with a market cap of more than $50 billion. In addition to the resurgence of Bitcoin to its $60,000 milestone, the exchange has benefited from being one of the custodians of spot Bitcoin ETF managers, where it facilitates the exchange of BTC transfers to ETF shares according to user demand. \nDespite Citron’s bearish stance, the short-seller is not always correct in its market predictions. In late 2022, shortly after the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Citron called for the shorting of Ether (ETH) in a now-deleted tweet.\n“We continue to be short ETHER as we believe this $130 bil token has as many common sense flaws as does the whole SBF story,” the short-seller stated at the time.

  "article_detailed_content": "In episode 49 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, host Elisha Owusu Akyaw and guest Antoni Zolciak, co-founder of Aleph Zero, delve into the complex world of privacy in the Web3 ecosystem, with a particular focus on privacy-centric projects. Zolciak, who is deeply entrenched in the evolution of privacy protocols, highlights the challenges and advancements in maintaining privacy in an increasingly digital age. The episode also spotlights privacy’s philosophical and technical underpinnings and discusses its implications for individuals and institutions.\nZolciak explains how privacy is a right that has lost its significance because people are okay with exchanging their privacy for free services. However, the issue is that most users do not understand how much of their data they are giving up and its implications for them.\nThe co-founder of Aleph Zero explains that privacy is important in the Web3 space since user experience shapes people’s approach to protecting their data. He explains that most users do not understand privacy in Web3 since the average user may be unable to differentiate between pseudonymous and anonymous transactions. Furthermore, most users do not recognize the split between privacy coins and privacy-enhancing blockchain infrastructure based on technology like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs).\nZolciak argues that recent events, such as the delisting of Monero (XMR) by major exchanges like Binance, are a side effect of the popularity and growth of the ecosystem and the regulations it has attracted. He adds that there seems to be a general consensus that removing projects like Monero answers the increasing trend of regulatory scrutiny. Zolciak quickly points out that some privacy-centric projects like Zcash (ZEC), “who proactively communicate and work toward ensuring compliance,” remain listed.\nOn the future of privacy in the blockchain industry, Zolciak believes that it will become a default feature with the advent of ZK-proofs. On the other hand, “killer applications” like privacy-enhanced decentralized finance applications will increase the adoption of privacy in the space.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

  "article_detailed_content": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform and stablecoin issuer Seneca Protocol has been exploited, according to a Feb. 28 statement on the protcol’s official X account. In a report seen by Cointelegraph, blockchain analytics firm CertiK estimated the losses at $6.4 million so far. The Seneca team urged users to revoke approvals for the affected contracts. Its staff are “currently working with security specialists to investigate the bug,” they stated.\nWe are actively working with security specialists to investigate the approval bug found today.\n\nIn the meantime, REVOKE approvals for the following addresses:#Ethereum\nPT-ezETH 0x529eBB6D157dFE5AE2AA7199a6f9E0e9830E6Dc1\napxETH 0xD837321Fc7fabA9af2f37EFFA08d4973A9BaCe34…\n— Seneca (@SenecaUSD) February 28, 2024\nSeneca Protocol is a DeFi lending app that allows users to deposit a variety of cryptocurrencies as collateral, which then can be used to mint and borrow the protocol’s native stablecoin, SenecaUSD.\nBlockchain data shows that an account ending in 42DC was able to transfer approximately 1,385.23 Pendleton Kelp restaked Ether (PT Kelp rsETH) from a Seneca collateral pool, which it did by calling the “performOperations” function. The account subsequently swapped these tokens for approximately $4 million worth of Ether (ETH) over the course of three transactions. After these swaps, the account transferred an additional 717.04 ETH derivative tokens from various collateral pools and swapped them for ETH.\nSeneca attack transactions. Source: Etherscan.\nIn its report, CertiK claimed that these transfers were malicious. They were made possible because the protocol contains a flaw in its “performOperations” function, the report stated. The bug allows any account to call the function while specifying OPERATION_CALL as the action to be performed. This allows the attacker to “perform external calls to any address as the callee and callData are fully controlled by the attacker.” As a result, the attacker was able to drain funds from the collateral pool that it didn’t own, CertiK claims.\nBlockchain investigator Spreek also warned users about the exploit on X, stating that it represented a “critical vulnerability.” Spreek suggested that users should revoke approvals of the addresses used in the exploit.\nRelated: Serenity Shield’s token falls nearly 99% after MetaMask wallet breach\nAccording to security researcher ddimitrov22, Seneca is suffering from an additional vulnerability that prevents developers from pausing the Seneca contracts, as the pause and unpause functions in them contain the keyword “internal,” which means “there is no way to call them.”\nThe Seneca protocol is hacked and it cannot be paused even though it inherits the Pausable library.\n\nThis is because the `_pause` and `_unpause` functions are internal and there is no way to call them. pic.twitter.com/en0qIsayMX\n— ddimitrov22 (@ddimitrovv22) February 28, 2024\nIn its post acknowledging the attack, the development team stated that they are conducting an investigation and will post an update “shortly.”\nHacks and exploits continue to threaten Web3 users in 2024.

  "article_detailed_content": "Update Feb. 29, 10:17 UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from CertiK's Joe Green.\nStablecoin protocol Seneca has offered a 20% bounty to the exploiter who gained access to at least $6.4 million in digital assets after exploiting an approval mechanism bug in the protocol’s smart contract. \nOn Feb. 28, multiple blockchain security firms flagged the exploit on the stablecoin protocol. Companies like CertiK warned users about the exploit, urging them to revoke approvals from an address on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. Initial estimates of the losses were at $3 million, but it was later found that over 1,900 Ether (ETH), worth about $6.4 million, were taken from the exploit.\nSeneca attacker’s wallet showing about $3 million in Ether. Source: CertiK\nSecurity analysts at CertiK explained that the exploit happened due to a critical “call” vulnerability in the protocol’s smart contract. Joe Green, the head of CertiK's quick response team, told Cointelegraph that this vulnerability allowed the attacker to perform external calls to any address. Green explained: \nIn this incident, an attacker was able to perform arbitrary external calls to transfer assets from addresses that had granted approvals to the vulnerable contracts directly to themselves.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nGreen added that a key takeaway from this incident is to pay attention to any external calls, particularly when upgrading contracts. This means that while a contract may be secure during its deployment, it may break on certain instances. “A entrusts B; B entrusts C; C entrusts D, but a new upgrade may break when A is not supposed to trust D,” Green shared. \nRelated: Shido token plummets 94% as exploiter drains Ethereum staking contract\nSeneca said it is working with specialists to investigate what happened. It also offered a $1.2 million bounty for the return of the stolen funds. In an on-chain message on Feb. 29, Seneca asked the hacker to return 80% of the stolen funds to an Ethereum address, allowing the hacker to keep 20%.\nSeneca’s on-chain message to the exploiter. Source: Seneca\nWithin the message, Seneca said it is collaborating with security providers and law enforcement to trace the funds. It urged the hacker to return the funds to avoid legal consequences. “Acting promptly is crucial, so we kindly request that you return the funds as soon as possible to avoid any further legal action,” it wrote.\nHours after Seneca’s message, the hacker returned about 1,537 ETH, worth around $5.3 million, to the wallet address Seneca specified. The exploiter kept 300 ETH, worth around $1 million, and accepted the 20% bounty offered by Seneca. The exploiter then transferred the ETH to two different addresses.\nMagazine: DeFi’s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

  "article_detailed_content": "GameStop Memes (GMS), an unofficial project seeking to capitalize on the success of the similar Wall Street Memes (WSM) token, has raised $4 million from investors, according to a Feb. 14 post from the project’s official X account. But some investors allege it is a never-ending presale that siphons away investors’ crypto and gives them nothing in return.\nAn investor who spoke on condition of anonymity told Cointelegraph that he never received GMS tokens despite having spent $1,000 purchasing them via the project’s website. Instead, the developers allegedly told him the tokens would only be delivered once the ongoing presale ended. In addition, he stated that the developers refused to give him an exact date as to when the presale would end, telling him that it would only end when all of the tokens were sold. “The presale is ongoing and never-ending,” the investor claimed.\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph via Telegram, the GameStop Memes development team confirmed that the tokens will not be sent to investors until after the presale is over. The team declined to give a definite end date for the presale but did say that if it fails to sell out, “we have plans in place to match the amount of presale allocation.”\nGameStop Memes does not appear to be associated with the official GameStop retailer’s trademark or its brand of retail stores. Cointelegraph reached out to GameStop for comments but did not receive a response by the time of publication. On the memecoin’s website, the project falsely claims to be partnered with Cointelegraph.\nRelated: GameStop to shut down NFT marketplace due to regulatory limbo\nGMS precursor raised $25 million\nGameStop Memes is inspired by and attempts to replicate the success of an earlier project called Wall Street Memes, which raised more than $25 million over the course of its presale.\nThe story of Wall Street Memes began in 2019 when members of the r/WallStreetBets subreddit launched an online store at Wallstmemes.com. The store featured T-shirts, mugs, baseball caps and other merchandise with Wall Street-themed designs. In January 2021, WallStreetBets gained notoriety by orchestrating a short squeeze on shares of electronics retailer GameStop. The short squeeze brought fresh attention to the Wallstmemes.com website that was associated with the Reddit group.\nWallstmemes.com homepage on Aug. 14, 2019. Source: Internet Archive\nAt that time, Wallstmemes.com had no connection to any Web3 projects. But in May 2023, a group of developers created Wall Street Memes, a memecoin project that sought to capitalize on the website’s success. Archived versions of Wallstmemes.com show that it promoted this coin as early as Oct. 3, implying either that the two teams were associated with each other or that the website was sold to the memecoin project’s team before October.\nThe WSM presale featured “stages.” In the first stage, the presale price was lowest, and it increased with each additional stage. The team announced that it was allocating 50% of raised funds to marketing, allowing it to generate interest in the coin as the presale progressed to later stages. On Sept. 18, it announced that the presale had only seven days remaining and that over $25 million had been raised. On Sept. 26, the token was listed on crypto exchange OKX.\nRelated: Wall Street Bets Robinhood ordeal shows importance of regulation\nOn the secondary market, WSM reached a peak price of nearly $0.07 on Sept. 30, 2023, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the time of publication, it is worth $0.0082. The WSM development team recently launched a casino app and a new version of the coin on BNB Smart Chain, and it claims that holders of the old token will soon be able to redeem it for the new one.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

It features a similar background and user interface as the earlier Wall Street Memes site and lists the presale as being in “Stage 1.”\nGameStop Memes website and app interface. Source: GameStop Memes\nThe site claims that GMS “emerged from the heroic battle that Wall Street Memes started [and] will continue the legacy and become the champion of champions that the community needs to carry on the battle.” It was inspired by “the successful launch of Wall Street Memes and all that they accomplished in the crypto space,” the website states.\nGameStop Memes claims partnerships, sends funds to CEXs\nOn its site, GameStop Memes claims to be partnered with numerous crypto media publications, including Cointelegraph itself.

Blockchain data shows that this contract was created on Oct. 4, 2023. At creation, the total supply of 1 billion GMS was sent to the deployer account. As of the time of publication, the tokens still sit in the deployer account. No GMS has been since distributed to investors.\nIn a Telegram chat with the Cointelegraph news team, an admin with the username “GameStopMemes” reiterated:\n“The presale is designed to end upon reaching the presale allocation. If we don’t reach the amount for presale allocation, we have plans in place in order to match the amount of the presale allocation. Additionally, the tokens purchased in the presale will be received in the investor’s wallet after the presale ends, which means that the tokens are only visible on our website at the moment.”\nThe admin continued, “Regarding the utility of the token, we’re aiming for more than just a memecoin. Our vision includes developing a protocol that adds tangible value, fostering a strong community, and creating a sustainable ecosystem around the token.” The admin did not state a specific date upon which the presale will end.\nBlockchain data shows that investors continue to purchase the coin, with the latest deposit occurring on Feb. 19. Although developers have not sent the tokens to investors, they have also not sold them into the market, as the total supply remains in the deployer account.\nExchange or buy ETH\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

  "article_detailed_content": "Blockchains can be considered virtual islands or distinct ecosystems, originally designed with limited ability to interact directly with one another. This design choice has historically restricted users’ ability to transfer assets freely across different blockchain platforms. \nBlockchain bridges have emerged as a solution to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless movement of funds across chains. This allows cross-chain compatibility, simplifying the process of transferring digital assets between diverse chains and enabling users to move their funds conveniently without getting stuck to one blockchain.\nThe use case of bridges isn’t limited to the transfer of assets between chains. It could include complex executions like simultaneous utilization of resources or functions by decentralized applications (DApps) from multiple blockchains.\nHow a bridge to Solana works\nA user can use a bridge to transfer a digital asset across blockchains. For instance, if a user wants to move Binance USD (BUSD) from the BNB Chain to Solana or vice-versa, the bridge will facilitate it. Although several mechanisms exist to complete the transfer, depending on the bridge, the process usually involves a lock-and-mint system.\nThis refers to locking assets on the source chain and minting the wrapped version of the asset of an equivalent value on the destination chain. While the circulating supply of the original asset remains unaffected, the process effectively creates a wrapped version of the asset on the destination chain, which has its own supply metrics.\nIn the reverse process, termed burning and minting, the system burns (destroys) the wrapped asset and mints (releases) the locked token, putting it back into circulation on the native blockchain.\nThough several bridges to Solana exist, the most popular based on total value locked are Portal (previously Wormhole) and Allbridge.\nProcess for bridging on a decentralized bridge platform\nThe following outlines the process for bridging using Portal.\nStep 1: Select the blockchains\nThe bridge requires the user to select the source blockchain (the chain the assets are coming from) and the target blockchain (Solana).\nStep 2: Connect the wallet\nConnect the Web3 wallet to the bridge using the “Connect” button. A prompt will appear asking the user to select from an array of supported wallet providers and connect it to the bridge.\nStep 3: Select an asset to transfer\nAfter a wallet is connected to the bridge, the user must select an asset from the “Select a Token” drop-down menu. The user needs to click any one from the list of supported assets or search for the asset they want to transfer.\nUsually, the interface would display the balance for the selected asset, enabling the user to identify the right token. After that, they need to enter the amount they wish to transfer.\nStep 4: Connect the Solana wallet\nWhen the user clicks the “Connect” button, the interface displays an array of supported Solana wallets, and the user can select from the options presented.\nClick on the relevant option and follow the prompts in the wallet to connect to the bridge.\nStep 5: Create associated token account\nOnce the origin and target wallets are linked, the user must create the token account in the Solana wallet by clicking the “Create associated token account” button to receive the tokens. If a user already has an associated token account, they can directly move to the next step.\nStep 6: Bridge the funds\nThe user must approve the token transfer through the bridge interface and confirm the transaction in the connected wallet. They can send assets to the bridge using the “Transfer” button.\nStep 7: Redeem the funds\nWhen the bridging of funds is complete, the user can use the “Redeem” button to claim the tokens from the bridge using their Solana wallet.\nProcess for bridging on a centralized bridge platform\nLet us understand how to bridge from a network to Solana using the OKX crypto exchange.\nStep 1: Transfer the funds to the wallet\nThe user must transfer the funds they want to bridge to their OKX wallet and then head over to the section called “Bridge.”\nStep 2: Connect wallet\nThe user must now click “Connect wallet” and scan the QR code to link to the OKX wallet. To add a wallet extension to the browser, users can select “OKX wallet extension.” Users who are using other wallets, such as MetaMask, can select “Other.” They need to enter the OKX wallet password and select “Confirm” to facilitate linking of the OKX wallet with OKX Swap.\nOnce the wallet is connected to OKX Swap, the user can complete bridging Tether (USDT) to Solana.\nStep 3: Complete the process\nThe user now selects the source blockchain and destination wallet (in this case, Solana). They must also choose the token in the source and destination chains they want to bridge. The interface will display the exact amount of tokens the user will receive.\nSelect “Swap across chains” and confirm the transaction when the wallet shows. The transfer via the bridge is then complete.\nUnderstanding bridging terminology and fee structures\nUnderstanding the terminology and fee structures is necessary before starting to bridge assets.\nSlippage\nSlippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a transaction and the price at which the transaction is actually executed. Minimum slippage works in the users’ favor. In the absence of flexibility regarding slippage, the transaction will be aborted if there is a price change, and the user will lose the network fee. When liquidity in the pool is limited, leaving some slippage becomes important.\nTrading route\nIn the context of asset bridging, a trading route typically refers to an asset’s path during a swap or bridge transaction, which can involve multiple steps or platforms. It is important to note that swap in centralized exchanges doesn’t function as a bridge but as a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator under the hood.\nNonetheless, not all centralized exchanges function this way. The algorithm automatically selects a suitable bridge. Some users provide users the option to change the bridge manually.\nNetwork fee\nThis refers to the cost of using the blockchain network to facilitate bridging. The fee structure is multilayered. Usually, four types of fees are levied: source network fees, destination network fees, bridge fees and conversion fees.\nA user pays source network fees to the source network to transfer an asset. Destination network fees are charged by the destination network (in this case, Solana) to allow transactions from the bridge to the wallet.\nBridge fees are levied by the bridges working underneath the swaps on centralized platforms. Conversion fees are the extra amount users must pay when switching between virtual assets during the bridging process. For instance, if a user is converting Cosmos (ATOM) on the Cosmos network to USDT on the Solana network, the ATOM to Solana (SOL) conversion will require a fee.\nTransaction time\nTransaction time in bridges depends on three variables: source network confirmation time, bridge processing time and destination network confirmation time. For instance, when the source network is Ethereum, the confirmation time depends on the amount of gas used.\nAs for the destination network, Solana is known for super-quick processing, and the funds should reach the wallet in mere seconds. The efficiency of the bridge being used is also a factor in the time taken in the bridging process.\nCommon risks concerning blockchain bridges\nBlockchain bridges deal with risks such as centralization, operational risks such as downtime or maintenance, and smart contract bugs or flaws. Some bridges rely on a centralized authority to facilitate the transfer of digital assets, which is not in sync with the ethos of the blockchain ecosystem. Moreover, like all software, bridges too are prone to downtime or maintenance.\nSometimes, when using bridges, transactions get stuck. However, reputable bridges are designed to manage such situations and will likely resolve the problem eventually. In case the transaction gets stuck because of inadequate gas, the funds will return to the user’s wallet.\nExamples of hacks that occurred via blockchain bridges\nSeveral significant hacks have occurred via blockchain bridges, illustrating vulnerabilities in these platforms:\nPoly Network hack (August 2021)\nThis was one of the biggest DeFi hacks, with almost $600 million stolen because of a flaw in Poly Network’s smart contracts. After discussions with the Poly Network team and the larger crypto community, the hacker eventually returned most of the funds.\nWormhole Network hack (February 2022)\nA hack that affected the Wormhole bridge, which connected several blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, cost over $320 million. Fake Ethereum-wrapped tokens were created on the Solana blockchain as part of the hack.\nRonin Network hack (March 2022)\nThe Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain developed for the Axie Infinity game, lost almost $625 million in Bitcoin (BTC). The hackers started making unauthorized withdrawals after compromising private keys.\nHarmony’s Horizon Bridge hack (June 2022)\nThe Horizon bridge, operated by Harmony, was exploited for around $100 million. The attackers compromised the bridge’s security by getting into the multisignature wallet that maintained the bridge’s finances.\nMultichain (July 2023)\nIn July 2023, Multichain, a cross-chain bridge, experienced a significant exploit, resulting in a loss of $125 million in cryptocurrencies, predominantly on Fantom. The bridge was temporarily halted due to unforeseen issues, leading to the arrest of Multichain’s CEO, Zhaoju, by Chinese authorities. It was disclosed that Zhaoju had sole control over the protocol’s funds, contrary to previous claims of decentralization. Currently, the Multichain bridge is inactive.\nIt’s important that users conduct proper due diligence before selecting a bridge to avoid malicious actors withdrawing funds from their wallets. Moreover, keeping a separate wallet to use with bridges is a wiser approach than using the primary wallet with substantial holdings.\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Finance Redefined newsletter\nA weekly summary of the most impactful DeFi stories, insights and education developments.

  "article_detailed_content": "Update Feb. 29, 7:11 AM UTC: This article has been updated to add comments from a CoinGecko spokesperson. \nDigital asset data aggregator CoinGecko has launched a feature that will make it easier for the community to access on-chain data from decentralized exchanges (DEXs). \n1/ GM Geckos, today's the day...\n\nOn-chain DEX data is now directly accessible on CoinGecko API – powered by @GeckoTerminal.\n\nGet on-chain token & liquidity pool data along with crypto price, market data, metadata and more from our API! Read on ⬇️#BuildwithCoinGecko pic.twitter.com/4LS41l3jBt\n— CoinGecko (@coingecko) February 28, 2024\nOn Feb. 28, CoinGecko announced that it is making DEX data available through its application programming interface (API). The data will be supported by its DEX tracking arm, GeckoTerminal. With the new integration, users will be able to access a unified API for crypto prices, market data and metadata. In addition, on-chain liquidity pool data for cryptocurrencies not yet listed on CoinGecko will also be available.\nAccording to CoinGecko, this new product update will expand its API coverage to 2.2 million tokens across 2.5 million liquidity pools. This will also mean users can access data from about 900 DEXs across 120 networks. This includes decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Orca, Curve and Balancer. This data is now available to CoinGecko’s paid API subscribers through 20 new endpoints.\nCoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong said the new update shows their commitment to empowering the crypto community with digital asset prices and market data. Ong explained:\n“With on-chain DEX data now accessible through the CoinGecko API, users can harness the information without having to consolidate from multiple sources, dive deeper into the decentralized ecosystem and unlock new avenues of product creation.”\nA CoinGecko spokesperson told Cointelegraph that this new development gives users a \"holistic view\" of the market. Users can better understand broader market trends and price movements by accessing on-chain DEX data.\nFurthermore, this unified API also simplifies processes for developers. “Updates and changes can be implemented efficiently without having to modify code for multiple APIs, therefore reducing the maintenance overhead and cost.”\nAs an example, the CoinGecko spokesperson explained that a Telegram bot that produced aggregated crypto prices for a token can now be designed to also share trending crypto pools on DEXs. This means that developers can update their products and further evolve them.\nRelated: 46% of largest crypto airdrops peaked within 14 days — CoinGecko\nCoinGecko’s announcement follows several developments within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. On Feb. 22, Aave deployed its lending protocol on the BNB Chain network. The BNB Chain Core Development Team told Cointelegraph in a previous statement that this integration will allow developers on the network to launch the application that builds on Aave’s liquidity.\nMeanwhile, Uniswap will be launching a web extension for its native wallet on Feb. 27. The DEX highlighted in an announcement that the extension will let users send, receive, buy and swap digital assets directly from their browsers. Uniswap said there is a waitlist for users who claimed a uni.eth username. They wrote that they would give these users access to the beta version of the extension.\nMagazine: DeFi’s billion-dollar secret: The insiders responsible for hacks\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

The zero-knowledge (ZK) platform blamed the leak on a copy/paste error in email metadata.\nAleo said in a post on social media platform X that the KYC information leak affected about 10 participants from its recent Aleo Learn and Earn events. Aleo stated that it removed the exposed information, investigated the cause and informed the affected individuals.\nThe platform gathered users’ unencrypted KYC data through the third-party protocol HackerOne. However, based on Aleo’s findings, it said that it has begun implementing new long-term technical controls for its KYC confirmation practices.\nAccording to reports on X on Feb. 25, Aleo, which focuses on ZK cryptography, revealed some users’ sensitive information.\nThis weekend, Know Your Customer (KYC) information about 10 participants from our recent Aleo Learn & Earn events was mistakenly exposed to other Aleo community members through a copy/paste error in email metadata.\n\nWe appreciate everyone’s patience as our team worked to remove…\n— Aleo (@AleoHQ) February 26, 2024\nZK layer-1 blockchain platforms focus on providing enhanced privacy and security for users.

  "article_detailed_content": "The legal counsel for former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried filed a memo in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York requesting the judge issue a prison sentence of between five and a quarter and six and a half years. SBF is facing a maximum of 110 years after a jury found him guilty of multiple counts of fraud and money laundering in November 2023.\nSBF was indicted on two counts of wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of securities fraud, one count of commodities fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering conspiracy. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the SBF case, is scheduled to announce sentencing on March 28.\nWhile federal prosecutors are expected to submit their sentencing recommendations on March 15, the Pre-sentence Investigation Report (PSR) has recommended a 100-year sentence for the former FTX CEO.\nFTX lawyers argued that the PSR proposed 100-year sentence is barbaric, as SBF is a first-time offender with no past criminal records, who was joined in the conduct “by at least four other culpable individuals, in a matter where victims are poised to recover — were always poised to recover — a hundred cents on the dollar.”\nRelated: ‘Fuck regulators,’ said SBF behind closed doors: Report\nThe filing weighed on the harm to customers, lenders and investors, which is zero, as the FTX bankruptcy estate is expected to fully repay customers. The legal counsel also cited numerous letters submitted by friends and family strongly supporting a lenient sentence.\nSBF has been locked up at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since summer 2023. Several stories from his jail time have surfaced over the months, from trading mackerel for a haircut to being extorted for protection. Now, another tale from his prison stay has surfaced, as The New York Times reports that SBF is offering trading and investment advice and asking prison guards to invest in Solana’s (SOL), a crypto token with which he has a long history.\nI'll buy as much SOL has you have, right now, at $3.\n\nSell me all you want.\n\nThen go fuck off.\n— SBF (@SBF_FTX) January 9, 2021\nFTX was once one of the largest crypto exchanges, valued at $32 billion in January 2022, before collapsing in November later that year.

  "article_detailed_content": "Crypto exchange Coinbase will soon enable users to recover lost assets sent to the platform’s unsupported blockchains, including BNB Chain and Polygon.\nAccording to the Feb. 27 announcement, users who sent assets to Coinbase accounts on BNB Chain or Polygon would simply need to provide their transaction ID and inbound Coinbase wallet address for the assets to be recovered.\n“Historically, these assets have been unrecoverable, in part because our employees and support channels don’t have access to the private keys needed to reverse these transactions,” the exchange said. For assets under $100, no fee is charged for recovery efforts by Coinbase. However, retrieving lost crypto over that amount would incur a commission of 5%. \nLike regular users, crypto exchanges’ wallets are typically multisig with automatic technical support for multiple blockchains and assets, even if the exchanges do not support tokens or networks on their user interface for reasons such as regulatory compliance.\nWhile wrongly sent assets are theoretically retrievable, recovering them typically requires ample time, effort, and coordination from senior executives who are in control of exchange multisig wallets. Cointelegraph reported in 2022 that, at the time, Binance was charging the equivalent of $500 for each retrieval of wrongly sent crypto assets. \nSince its inception, Coinbase’s recovery tool has retrieved $160 million worth of lost digital assets from the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently around 3,000 ERC-20 tokens mistakenly sent to Coinbase via BNB Chain and 800 such tokens sent via Polygon.\n“We’re continuously investigating and expanding the scope of this feature to support additional assets and networks,\" Coinbase wrote. \"Due to the technical complexities surrounding the recovery of unsupported assets, we can’t guarantee that any particular asset will be eligible in the future.”\nRelated: Crypto exchange user goes AWOL after being sent $650K by mistake",

  "article_detailed_content": "The success of the recently launched Backpack cryptocurrency exchange was a testament to a maturing crypto industry that demands more trustworthy exchanges, Armani Ferrante, the founder and CEO of Backpack, told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on Feb. 27.\n“What we saw was ultimately just validation of the thesis that the world needs a new trustworthy crypto exchange,” he said.\nBackpack surpassed $1 billion in 24-hour volume on Feb. 18, within four days of the launch of its trading pre-season. The exchange’s daily trading volume was down 6.4% to $296 million in the 24 hours leading up to 4:30 pm UTC on Feb. 27, according to CoinGecko data.\nTrading volume metrics, Backpack exchange. Source: CoinGecko\nCrypto investors are demanding more transparent solutions, following black swan events in both decentralized finance protocols and legacy financial institutions during the past two years, Ferrante told Cointelegraph, adding:\n“We’re at this inflection point in the industry where we’re rising out of the ashes of FTX, as you mentioned, but also bringing the industry into a more mature state. This includes everything from security to compliance and building deserved trust with the world.”\nSeveral large regional banks collapsed in the United States in 2023, including Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. Over in Switzerland, Credit Suisse, which was the country’s second-largest bank, collapsed in March. Credit Suisse was acquired by the country’s central bank, UBS, on March 19 in an effort by Swiss authorities to avert a banking sector meltdown.\nAccording to Ferrante, crypto can vastly improve on the shortcomings of legacy financial products, which is something that the founder will be aiming to accelerate in the future. He said:\n“We’re excited to bring to the world a lot of the real tangible benefits of blockchain technology to build next-generation financial infrastructure. We have a big opportunity, and I think a lot of it has already been validated.”\nFerrante added that the exchange is also focused on global expansion. Backpack received a virtual asset service provider license from the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority in October 2023. The Solana-based exchange bagged many other operational licenses across several jurisdictions worldwide in the last half of 2023.\nRelated: MicroStrategy adds 3K BTC as Bitcoin ETFs are poised to surpass gold ETFs",

Industry analysts predict significant growth, with the blockchain-based messaging apps market anticipated to exceed $600 million by 2030.\nLeveraging decentralization, data privacy, interoperability and innovative monetization models, Web3 messaging platforms have the potential to address many of the shortcomings of their centralized counterparts.\nUnlocking Web3 messaging\nPlatforms like WhatsApp are centralized — owned and controlled by a single entity — which can lead to issues like censorship, single points of failure and lack of user control. Web3 messaging systems leverage blockchain technology to decentralize infrastructure, distribute control among network participants and reduce censorship risks.\nHow peer-to-peer platforms like WhatsApp work. Source: Beoble\nDesigned to be interoperable with various decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain networks, Web3 messaging protocols enable developers to seamlessly integrate messaging functionality into their decentralized services — a stark contrast to their traditional equivalents that host closed ecosystems, which limit communication with users on other platforms.\nBeoble, a communication infrastructure and ecosystem that allows users to chat between wallets, is one of the Web3 messaging platforms ready to change how people use digital communication. The platform comprises a web-based chat application and a toolkit for seamless integration with DApps.\nDubbed “WhatsApp for Web3,” Beoble removes the need for login methods like Twitter or Discord, instead mandating only a wallet for access. Users can log in using their wallets and send texts, images, videos, links and files across blockchain networks.\nBlockchain app users can utilize emojis and nonfungible token (NFT) stickers in their digital communication with Beoble, adding a layer of personality to their conversations. With features like message reactions, replies and customizable chatroom settings, Beoble caters to the diverse needs of Web3 enthusiasts.\nToken-gated chatrooms as spam filters\nThe wallet-to-wallet communication infrastructure supports token-gated chatrooms where users can set up exclusive digital spaces with specific criteria for entry, such as ownership of certain NFTs, minimum token holdings or transaction history thresholds.\nToken-gated chatrooms also serve as spam filtering mechanisms. Source: Beoble\nFor instance, one room can be exclusive to Pudgy Penguin NFT holders, while another may require a minimum balance of Ether (ETH) on users’ related Web3 wallets.\nBy leveraging on-chain data, Beoble empowers users to filter out spammers and scammers from direct messaging or sending group chat invitations based on predefined criteria.\nWallet tracker with social features\nBy following other users, individuals can add them to their contact list, ensuring easy access for direct messaging and group interactions. Beoble utilizes follow data to provide personalized user and chatroom recommendations through its algorithm, enhancing the overall user experience.\nBeyond social connectivity, the “Follow” action serves as a wallet activity tracker. Upon following a user, individuals are automatically enrolled in follower rooms. Beoble posts real-time transaction updates related to the followed user’s wallet in follower rooms,  facilitating discussions among followers and fostering an informed community environment.\nBeoble has already completed a fundraising round, securing $5 million. The platform has also seen traction with over 300,000 monthly active users, 50,000 daily active wallets and 21 million delivered chats. It is developing Beoble 2.0, a messaging protocol that lets users chat across “all chains and DApps.” The upcoming version is scheduled to be released in 2024.\nThe emergence of Web3 messaging platforms presents a transformative opportunity to overcome the limitations of centralized communication systems, offering users enhanced privacy, interoperability and monetization options.\nLearn more about Beoble\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "Despite an ongoing crypto bull market, it appears that demand for Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners and servers has been lukewarm.\nOn Feb. 27, Bitcoin ASIC manufacturer Canaan reported Q4 2023 earnings. In its report, the company disclosed revenue of $49 million, representing a decrease of 16% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, the firm’s net loss widened to $139 million versus $91.6 million in Q4 2022. Despite an increase in the amount of computing power sold and Bitcoin (BTC) price recovery, Canaan said that its ASICs were sold at lower prices compared to the market last year. \nIn addition, the firm forecasts tougher market conditions ahead. \"For the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2024, the Company expects total revenues to be approximately US$33 million and US$70 million, respectively, considering the challenging market conditions across the industry,\" Canaan stated. During the quarter, the firm recognized a non-cash inventory writedown of $55 million due to pricing pressures.\nBitcoin has seen stellar gains recently, with a return of 144.4% over the past year. Parallel to the price increase, BTC’s mining difficulty has also doubled to 81.73 trillion during the same period. Coupled with persistently high electricity prices and the next Bitcoin halving in April, where mining rewards will be reduced by 50%, the Bitcoin mining industry will likely face new headwinds even as the coin’s price returns to all-time highs. Canaan writes:\n\"While we acknowledge the persisting challenges of the ongoing bearish market for mining machines, we draw inspiration from the recent approval and listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This milestone signals the potential for Bitcoin to attract a larger user base and foster a more concrete consensus in the long run.\"\nOn Feb. 16, Cointelegraph reported that 20% of Bitcoin miners' hash rate could go offline post-halving due to  lack of profitability. \"Given how sensitive the breakevens are for the various ASIC models to Bitcoin price and transaction fees as a percent of rewards, we estimate that between 15 – 20% of network hash rate coming from the ASIC models could come offline,\" wrote analysts at Galaxy Research. \nRelated: Riot Platforms, other miners still see chip shortage, ESG regs as risks",

  "article_detailed_content": "The Solana network experienced a significant outage on Feb. 6 at 10:22 am UTC, with block production halted for over five hours before validators restarted the network. \nThis is not the first time Solana has gone down. Since January 2022, Solana has seen around half a dozen significant outages and 15 partial or major outage days.\nEngineers from across the ecosystem are investigating an outage on mainnet-beta. This thread will be updated as more information becomes available https://t.co/rfeioQ6BG9\n— Solana Status (@SolanaStatus) February 6, 2024\nThe incidents varied in severity, ranging from partial to total network outages, and their causes included software vulnerabilities in the network and denial-of-service and resource exhaustion attacks.\nThe most recent outage was blamed on a bug that resulted in an infinite loop error, which caused the validators to stall on a particular block. An infinite loop error causes a program to get stuck in an endless cycle, which, in the case of Solana, prevented validators from verifying transactions on the network as they were stuck trying to process the same block.\nPost-mortem\nAnza, a Solana-focused software development firm, released a postmortem report of the recent outage on Feb. 9 detailing its cause and how validators restarted the network. The report revealed that Solana’s Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation cache, which compiles all programs before executing a transaction, encountered the bug.\nEarlier, the JIT cache was implemented using “ExecutorsCache,” however, with the v1.16 release, ExecutorsCache was replaced by a new implementation called “LoadedPrograms.” The new loader program used accounting information stored in a program’s on-chain account to look up its most recent deployment slot and use this to calculate the effective slot height.\nHowever, this loader program encountered a legacy loader issue resulting in the JIT cache encountering a loop with older programs, causing it to recompile them repeatedly instead of efficiently accessing and executing their instructions. This glitch resulted in a network stall, as the system became bogged down in an infinite loop, unable to process transactions or move forward.\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph that there was a process to replace the old loader system with a new motor system, but it was scheduled to be disabled with an updated version.\n“It looks like someone intentionally called that old instruction set, which hadn’t been used in quite a long time but was still around in the codebase. The JIT compiler ran into issues where it couldn’t find what it was looking for. And that’s what created the infinite loop,”\nSolana engineers quickly discovered and fixed the problem, updated the system’s processes, and identified these older programs to prevent future recompilation cycles. This solution entailed reducing the deployment of troublesome legacy loaders to ensure that all program instructions could be accessed accurately and effectively without falling into the recompilation trap.\nRecent: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developers\nSome critics have said that a significant factor contributing to Solana’s outages is the lack of client diversity, leading to potential central points of failure. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of open source decentralized exchange platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph that Solana’s developers and validators prioritize shipping code fast over maintaining perfect network uptime, adding:\n“The key reason is centralization and lack of validator client options. Solana’s ambition for high throughput and low transaction times puts immense pressure on its infrastructure, making it susceptible to performance degradation and outages.”\nHowever, Federa suggests Solana possesses much more accurate architecture and explains that only two smart contract networks worldwide have independent validator clients: Ethereum and Solana. Currently, Solana has one major validator client built on one functional codebase.\n“Solana has never had an outage due to a fault in consensus or something along those lines. The problems have always been implementation details. It’s always been that there’s been a bug somewhere in the implementation layer, which is not better or worse. It’s just an important kind of accuracy,” Austin explained.\nThe Solana mainnet “beta” saga\nThe Solana blockchain was launched in March 2020, and over the next four years, the network has made significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Solana ranks as the fifth-largest DeFi chain in total value locked, with over $1.7 billion in capital allocated to different on-chain protocols. Its native Solana (SOL) token has a market valuation of around $49 billion, making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency.\nDespite a magnificent track record, Solana has never officially come out of its beta phase. The blockchain is still referred to as being in mainnet beta. Beta is a term that refers to nearly finished software that a select group of users is testing before an official launch.\nHowever, the Solana blockchain is open to everyone, with hundreds of decentralized applications utilized to launch various products. The blockchain ecosystem also boasts a vibrant nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem.\nSolana underwent brief private and public beta testing before releasing v1.0 four years ago, and today, the network processes more transactions than most other chains.\nEven though the code is still changing, Solana is much beyond what can be considered beta software. The persistent misperception results from a mix-up between pre-launch testing and post-launch software maturity and misconceptions around Solana’s messaging.\nRecent: How can crypto firms bridge the gap with traditional finance?\nThe beta status has attracted much criticism of the blockchain, especially in light of its outages over the past two years. Crypto users on social media have often mocked that Solana’s status as a mainstream blockchain often changes to mainnet beta and back, depending on whether the chain is down.\nSolana is a joke. Period.\n\nHow many halts have there been in lasts months? The “it’s a beta” is not an excuse anymore. $SOL #Solana pic.twitter.com/IjvRaM58dZ\n— David Miller ⬡ (@CryptoDavid_) May 1, 2022\nFedera claimed that most blockchain systems are in beta today and that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably complete mainnets and explained:\n“It takes a long time for software systems to stabilize and be feature-complete as important new features are still being shipped on the Solana network. I think we’re probably nearing the end of that beta phase. From a technology standpoint, one of the significant milestones for that will be the launch of a second independent validator client.”\nMany DeFi proponents believe that Solana’s downtime is a definite roadblock to its aim of becoming an Ethereum competitor. Still, the developers have worked to ensure the bugs leading to past downtimes don’t impact the network in the future. Despite its tainted history of downtime, its high speed and low cost play a key role in attracting new projects to the platform.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Ripple is partnering with the Axelar Foundation to add interoperability to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain, targeting the next stage of growth for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).\nThe partnership will enable developers to use Axelar’s General Message Passing (GMP) to execute calls on smart contracts residing on over 55 blockchains, facilitating the cross-chain deployment of decentralized applications on the XRPL — Ripple’s open-source public blockchain.\nBenefits of the integration include unlocking liquidity for stablecoins and large-cap assets, according to the companies.\n“Real world asset tokenization will be the driving force of the blockchain economy with real estate, commodities and treasuries and bonds being the leading use cases,” David Schwartz, chief technology officer of Ripple and co-creator of the XRPL, told Cointelegraph. Schwartz foresees traditional lending platforms increasingly using tokenized RWAs for collateralized loans.\nThe XRPL has been around for over a decade. According to a recent report from Messari, the network registered an 8.8% growth in daily activity volume in 2023, driven by numerous types of transactions, including a 73.7% growth in nonfungible tokens activity.\nAxelar, on the other hand, is a public blockchain backed by the Axelar Foundation. It offers an overlay of communication between blockchains, allowing networks to share data without intermediaries or centralized parties. The project was founded in 2020 by inaugural team members at Algorand and Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates.\n“Axelar’s integration will help broaden blockchain adoption by facilitating RWA,” believes Schwartz.\nTokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. These tokens can represent real-world assets like real estate, art or shares in a company, making them easier to buy, sell and trade.\nInvestment bank Citi predicts that RWA tokenization could become the next “killer use case” in crypto, estimating the market to reach between $4 trillion and $5 trillion by 2030. This growth is expected to be driven primarily by the tokenization of private equity, real estate and debt markets, with private equity likely becoming the most tokenized asset class due to its favorable properties for liquidity and fractionalization.\nMagazine: ‘Moral responsibility’ — Can blockchain really improve trust in AI?",

In 2023, its central bank committed $112 million to support local fintech solutions from emerging Web3 technologies.\nDuring the last year, Singapore even saw many of the world’s major crypto platforms, such as Blockchain.com, Circle, Crypto.com and Coinbase, apply for licenses to operate in the country.\nIn June, both Japanese and Singaporean regulators joined forces on the regulation and pilot testing of cryptocurrency projects in accordance with the latter’s Project Guardian initiative.\nNonetheless, Kim said countries in the region still remain fragmented in their regulatory approach to the industry:\n“This regulatory diversity underscores the challenges and opportunities inherent in the region’s journey toward adopting and regulating Web3 technologies. We hope that as leading countries in Southeast Asia mature in Web3 adoption, the region can create more synergy for the Southeast Asian region as a whole.”\nKim said a collaborative spirit in Southeast Asia could be an essential piece to the puzzle of the region’s ability to “fully realize the potential and benefits of ongoing Web3 adoption.”\nWeb2 aiding Web3 adoption\nKim also touched on the importance of the presence of legacy Web2 giants in the region helping to aid Web3 adoption, particularly at the crossroads of Web3 and gaming. \n“The region has witnessed substantial involvement from major Web2 companies in the burgeoning Web3 landscape, particularly in the realm of gaming. For many Web2 enterprises, gaming is the perfect getaway.”\nHe gave the example of large Web2 companies like Sony, Square Enix and Rio Aisa being both active in the region and championing local Web3 gaming initiatives.\n“Sony’s filing of a patent for NFT transfers between games and consoles underscores its commitment to integrating blockchain technology into the gaming experience. Square Enix is another prominent player, pushing into Web3 with Symbiogenesis, a gamified collectible experience,” he said, adding, “The former CEO of Riot Asia is contributing to the Web3 ecosystem by developing a blockchain-powered MOBA game.”\n“These strategic partnerships and initiatives contribute significantly to the creation of a crypto-friendly ecosystem in both South America and Southeast Asia.”\nEconomic empowerment and proactive regulations\nDespite many of these countries being open to new frontiers in the fintech space, more than 70% of adults in Southeast Asia still are without sufficient access to financial services, while millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the region face large funding gaps. \nKim explained that crypto helps bridge the gaps in the region and fosters economic empowerment of such groups, ushering in a “new era of comprehensive financial accessibility.”\nHe highlighted that many Southeast Asian countries have acknowledged the potential and the benefits of crypto for local populations and have adopted policies that reflect this:\n“Rather than adopting a restrictive approach, these frameworks often focus on providing clarity, fostering innovation and ensuring consumer protection.”\nHowever, as innovative as this technology has been for the region, there has also been an uptick in illicit activity involving cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to a report by the United Nations, the “gray” casino industry in Southeast Asia is taking advantage of crypto and other modern technologies.\nIncoming AI dominance\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has also been a major theme in Southeast Asia, with countries like Singapore jumping on the bandwagon to develop the technology suited for local communities. \nKim said the synergy between the AI, crypto and blockchain sectors in Southeast Asia holds “immense potential” for advancing the area into a global tech hub.\n“The adoption and integration of AI technologies have the potential to drive innovation, improve efficiency across various sectors and position Southeast Asia as a key player in the global tech-driven economy.”\nAccording to data from the US-ASEAN Business Council, AI has the potential to contribute nearly $1 trillion to the gross domestic product of Southeast Asia by 2030 notably for Indonesia, one of the region’s largest economies.\nMagazine: 3AC’s $700M Worldcoin windfall, China vs the crypto spies: Asia Express\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

  "article_detailed_content": "The possibility of miners or validators manipulating block data poses an obstacle to the widespread adoption of blockchain-based products. In response, Neo has launched its new sidechain, Neo X, which aims to tackle MEV attacks to offer a secure platform that fosters trust and drives innovation in the blockchain industry.\nShort for miner or maximal extractable value, MEV is a pivotal concept in the blockchain space, representing miners’ and validators’ methods to enhance their earnings through transaction manipulation. This manipulation power sometimes paves the way for MEV attacks, where miners take advantage of their positions and place their transactions in front of users, for example, or purposely hold back the publication of completed blocks.\nThe exploitation of MEV has been central to several high-profile incidents across many blockchain platforms. One such instance involved an MEV bot linked to the Curve finance hack, which executed a heist of a staggering $61 million. In another example, a Solana MEV bot extracted $1.7 million using the Dogwifhat token. Additionally, an exploit targeting sandwich trading bots resulted in a loss of $25 million.\nMEV attacks threaten the decentralized and transparent ethos of blockchain, creating significant fairness and security issues in the DeFi space. An EVM-compatible sidechain addresses the challenge of MEV attacks and offers a secure platform that fosters trust in the blockchain industry.\nMEV-resistant blockchain\nNeo, an open-source and community-driven blockchain platform designed to welcome developers into the Smart Economy, has taken a proactive stance by introducing its EVM-compatible sidechain Neo X.\nEVM, short for Ethereum Virtual Machine, refers to the technology that allows Ethereum to run decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Sidechains, on the other hand, running alongside the main chain, help expand the utility of the main network by operating as independent - but interoperable - blockchains.\nNeo enables developers to digitize and automate asset management through its robust smart contracts. It can integrate with common programming languages and tools, meeting developers where they are and providing the most feature-packed blockchain platform for building full-stack DApps. Neo offers full native support for robust infrastructure, including decentralized storage, oracles and domain services.\nHow the Neo X chain achieves MEV resistance. Source: Neo\nIn combating MEV attacks, Neo X introduces two innovative features, targeting consensus mechanism exploitation and transaction manipulation.\nFirst, the dBFT consensus mechanism, pioneered by Neo, eliminates toxic MEV from the protocol level, preventing miners or validators from compromising the block generation process. It ensures that no consensus nodes, in their rational mind, would withhold the block-producing process, and once a block is generated, there is no room for transaction rearrangement.\nSecondly, Neo X utilizes a combination of two classic cryptography tools, Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and threshold encryption/decryption, to encrypt and decrypt transaction information. This ensures that transaction processors cannot see inside the transactions, forcing miners and validators to process all transactions neutrally. This combined method is known as enveloped transactions. Similar to the transition from HTTP to HTTPS, it adds security and protects the information and the user, providing the network infrastructure for fair and orderly transactions.\nAddressing the challenges of MEV attacks, Neo founder Da Hongfei highlighted their significant financial implications. “Toxic MEV is a huge problem for the blockchain industry, with figures showing billions being lost to malicious miners and validators who overstep their responsibilities,” he said.\nNeo Founder Da Hongfei recently announced the EVM-compatible sidechain at the finale of the Neo APAC Hackathon in Hong Kong. Source: Neo\nDa stressed the importance of the Neo X sidechain integrating enveloped transactions with Neo’s dBFT consensus mechanism, which is crucial in safeguarding users; “Through this integration, we can ensure the utmost in user protection and retain the security required to ensure the successful growth and adoption of blockchain.”\nThe burgeoning field of blockchain technology\nBeyond improving security with Neo X’s MEV-resistant feature, Neo aims to develop the most compatible and developer-friendly blockchain infrastructure through its N3 protocol. Neo’s ecosystem aims to include the tools developers need by supporting multiple virtual machines and programming languages.\nIntroducing an MEV-resistant sidechain like Neo X signifies a crucial advancement in addressing these pivotal security issues. Developers and users, reassured by the increased security and fairness, are more likely to explore and contribute to the burgeoning field of blockchain technology, paving the way for a richer, more diverse and innovative blockchain landscape.\nLearn more about Neo X\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the open-source operating system (OS) Linux is a perfect solution for Elon Musk’s Microsoft Windows OS issues. He invited Musk to the desktop Linux community a day after Musk complained about not being able to install Microsoft’s Windows OS on his newly bought computer without a Microsoft account.\nLike Windows, iOS and macOS, Linux is an OS, but unlike most others, Linux is open-source. The Linux OS was first released in September 1991, and over the years, it has gained popularity with a niche user base. Today, popular mobile OS Android is powered by the Linux OS.\nOpen-source software has its source code available for anyone to see, alter and improve. When a computer program’s source code is available to programmers, they can enhance it by adding new features or correcting malfunctioning sections.\nButerin is a big-time open-source advocate; thus, his suggestion came as no surprise to many. Many users on X lauded Buterin for promoting open-source software; however, a few others also reminded that Linux might not be the best option for Musk, given that his main focus of using the PC would be for gaming.\nIt has been a while since I've used Linux; it's great for development, but I'm not sure about gaming. It looks like steam does have an installer for Linux.\n— Amol Jadhav (@amoljadhav00) February 27, 2024\nOn Feb. 26, Musk took to X to share that he could not use his laptop PC with Windows OS without a Microsoft account. He added that earlier, there used to be an “option to skip signing in to or creating a Microsoft account.”\nRelated: The Ethereum Merge is completed: Here’s what’s next\nMany users on the platform added that it was still possible to use Windows OS without a Microsoft account, which eventually led to a community note added to Musk’s tweet. However, Musk responded to the community note, claiming the option is no longer available. His response to the community note received another note explaining that the option is still available but a bit more complex than Windows 10 and requires some tricky “workarounds that the average Andy might not be aware of.”\nCommunity Notes is failing here. This option no longer exists. pic.twitter.com/b04hBivqXo\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 25, 2024\nUsers on X also added the complex workaround process in the comment for Musk to navigate through the process, but the Tesla CEO believes the process shouldn’t be this complex.\nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?",

  "article_detailed_content": "The Bitcoin halving is a crucial event in the cryptocurrency space that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the reward that miners receive for validating transactions on the Bitcoin network. As the name suggests, a Bitcoin halving event cuts the rewards in half for miners mining Bitcoin blocks that add transactions to the Bitcoin ledger. The process is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol to control its supply and retain its scarcity and limited supply status. \nThe Bitcoin halving is crucial for traders due to its direct impact on Bitcoin (BTC), its market supply and, consequently, the price dynamics in the broader cryptocurrency market. This article explores Bitcoin trading strategies during the halving, cryptocurrency market dynamics, price trends, trading signals and opportunities and overall investor behavior during the Bitcoin halving periods.\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers known as nodes. Bitcoin mining is the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin’s public, decentralized ledger. Miners are individuals or entities that play a crucial role in securing and validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In return for their efforts, miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoin.\nBitcoin mining uses hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, which validate and secure transactions on the network. Miners use computational power and compete to solve these puzzles, and the first one to solve it gets to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain.\nThe Bitcoin halving refers to the reduction in the reward given to miners for solving complex mathematical problems and validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is a mechanism built into the Bitcoin protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and it occurs roughly every four years (or every 210,000 blocks).\nDuring this event, miner rewards for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain are cut in half. For the broader crypto market, halvings reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market.\nInitially, miners received 50 Bitcoin as a reward for each block they added to the blockchain when Bitcoin was first launched. At the first halving, the reward fell to 25 Bitcoin, and subsequent halvings in 2016 and 2020 decreased the reward to 12.5 and 6.25 BTC, respectively. In April 2024, it will drop to 3.125 BTC, and the process will continue until all 21 million Bitcoin are mined.\nReducing mining rewards controls the issuance of new Bitcoin and mimics the scarcity characteristics of precious metals like gold. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million, and by making it progressively harder and more resource-intensive to mine new BTC, the issuance rate slows down, creating scarcity and potentially driving up the value of each Bitcoin.\nRelated: Bitcoin halving 2024: Everything you need to know\nThe 2024 Bitcoin halving\nAlthough the timing of the next halving is uncertain because the Bitcoin algorithm governs the occurrence of halving events based on the creation of blocks, experts have pointed to a likely date in April 2024, aligning closely with the historical four-year cycle.\nThe final halving is predicted to occur in the year 2140, when the number of BTC circulating will reach its maximum supply of 21 million. At this point, no more new Bitcoin will be mined.\nThe Bitcoin halving is designed to be somewhat predictable to avoid causing significant disruptions to the network. Despite this, the lead-up to and aftermath of a halving often sees heightened volatility in the price of Bitcoin.\nWhat is the historical impact of the Bitcoin halving on BTC price trends?\nThe price trends from historical data and fundamental analysis show that Bitcoin halvings tend to impact the price of Bitcoin favorably. The halving events typically instill optimism and a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency markets, translating into positive price movements.\nThe positive momentum can be attributed to various factors, primarily economic demand-supply dynamics. The decrease in Bitcoin’s supply issuance makes it more scarce, boosting demand and driving up its value.\nMoreover, the halving event draws attention to the cryptocurrency space, changing investor behavior, attracting new investors and promoting fear of missing out (FOMO), bringing price predictions by influential commentators on social media and established media and higher community engagement, which often contributes to an uptick in trading activity.\nThe period preceding a halving frequently initiates conversations and educational campaigns regarding the foundational principles of Bitcoin, blockchain technology and the economics of cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, while historical trends indicate a correlation between halving events and price increases, this is not guaranteed, and investors should do their own research to understand the price trends during each halving.\nConsistent trends have become evident in price analysis during each Bitcoin halving. In 2016, the value of BTC stood at $665 before halving, surging to $2,250 a year later.\nThe halving in 2020 occurred in May when Bitcoin was priced at $8,740. By the end of that same year, BTC had soared to $29,000. Therefore, since a bullish market trend has typically followed each previous Bitcoin halving cycle, forecasts suggest the 2024 cycle will be no different.\nMarket volatility and trading opportunities during the Bitcoin halving\nThe anticipation and occurrence of a Bitcoin halving event are often accompanied by increased market volatility. This historical volatility creates both challenges and opportunities for traders. While the uncertainty may pose risks, it also opens avenues for strategic trading, especially for those adept at navigating price swings.\nTraders can follow the prevailing trend in the lead-up to and after the halving, either to go long in a bullish trend or short in a bearish trend. Traders can identify key resistance or support levels to execute trades when the price breaks out of these levels.\nBreakouts can help signify potential trend reversals or the continuation of an existing trend. Support levels are price levels where the Bitcoin price may stop falling, and resistance levels are where it tends to halt its upward movement.\nTraders can identify these levels using technical analysis tools like trendlines, moving averages or horizontal support and resistance lines, waiting for the price to break decisively above a resistance level or below a support level. The breakout is confirmed when the price closes above or below the identified level, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.\nFor example, in 2016, before the halving, Bitcoin’s price was trading at around $665. Traders observing a resistance level at $700 may have adopted a breakout strategy, and if the price broke decisively above $700, it could signal a bullish breakout.\nOnce the breakout is confirmed, traders may enter a long position (buy) if it is a bullish breakout or a short position (sell) if it is a bearish breakout. Stop-loss orders and take-profit levels are typically set to manage risk and secure profits.\nTraders should continue to monitor the trade, adjusting their strategy as the market evolves. Breakout trades aim to capture the momentum generated by the price breaking through a significant level.\nBreakout trading carries risks, and false breakouts can occur. Therefore, traders must exercise caution and do their research to filter out potential false breakouts.\nAdditionally, traders can explore price differentials across various crypto exchanges. Bitcoin’s volatility may create temporary pricing imbalances, and traders can capitalize on these arbitrage opportunities by buying on one exchange and selling on another.\nRelated: Bitcoin halving 2024 — Miners predict potential outcomes of reduced BTC rewards\nRisk assessment during the Bitcoin halving\nAlthough the Bitcoin halving is commonly perceived as a positive occurrence, there are inherent risks, particularly in the short term. The period leading up to the halving often triggers speculative market behavior, introducing the potential for heightened volatility.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to recognize the possibility of a bear trend or temporary price corrections if market expectations are not aligned with the actual outcomes. Furthermore, traders must ensure that their cryptocurrency holdings are stored securely. Consider using a hardware wallet or a secure software wallet and enable two-factor authentication for added security.\nMarket sentiment, regulatory developments, and global economic factors can contribute to the overall risk landscape associated with the Bitcoin halving, emphasizing the importance of a well-informed and adaptable approach to investment strategies.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

  "article_detailed_content": "All in Bits, a firm headed by Cosmos co-founder Jae Kwon, is preparing to launch its new GovGen blockchain and token on Feb. 27, ahead of the Cosmos Hub AtomOne fork.\nThe launch will include the genesis distribution of the ”GovGen” token to Cosmos Hub stakeholders who previously voted “no” or “no with veto” to Prop 848, a proposal to lower inflation of the ATOM (ATOM) token to 10%. This token will purportedly be strictly used for voting and won’t be transferable.\n1/ As you may know, the GovGen governance-only chain intended to help shape the outcome of AtomOne is planned to launch on Tuesday, February 27, 2024, at 6 a.m. PST (2 p.m. UTC). This thread will cover highlights, but please read the full article here:https://t.co/6c78tbU2Sx\n— All in Bits (@Allinbits_inc) February 24, 2024\nCosmos Hub\nEssentially, two camps have arisen in the world of Cosmos Hub after Prop 848 passed with a slim majority, with 73,165,203 ATOM allocated to “yes” versus 56,667,011 ATOM allocated to “no,” plus 11,669,549 ATOM to “NWV” (no with veto).\nThe first camp appears to have rallied behind Cosmos co-founder Ethan Buchman and popular organizations such as ZKValidator, which supported Prop 848.\nWe voted YES on @cosmos Hub Prop 848\n----\n\nThis seems to be a controversial proposal, but in our view, it shouldn't be!\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem is maturing, and inflation economics need to mature too.\n\nDouble digit inflation is not necessary for security, weakens ATOM price long…\n— ZKV (@zkv_xyz) November 17, 2023\nThe second camp has evidently rallied behind JKwon and leading groups such as Allnodes, which voted against the proposal.\nWe voted NO on $ATOM prop #848 not only because it overlooks the importance of small validators and could centralize the ecosystem. Lowering inflation isn't a way to boost token value. Quick, untested changes could harm network integrity.\n\nLong read with reasoning 1/3\n— Allnodes (@Allnodes) November 19, 2023\nIn the wake of the disagreement, the second camp will fork the Cosmos Hub blockchain on Feb. 27 and govern the new fork via the coalition of AtomOne stakeholders with GovGen, a sidestrapped blockchain and token.\nIt’s unclear exactly what the distribution of GovGen tokens will look like. The first 10% has been preallocated to governance costs, and the rest will be split among ATOM holders with voting power, though those who voted “no” or “NWV” are slated to receive more than “yes” voters, ostensibly giving them the majority power for decision-making.\nRelated: AI tokens rally amid Nvidia’s breakout earnings\nAccording to a GitHub post from the AtomOne team, this move was at least partially made for political purposes:\n“These and prior disagreements have now made clear the need for an alternative hub with a renewed focus and Alignment to serve as the canonical minimal IBC/ICS token hub with respect to Cosmos to champion the ideals of sovereignty, security, and decentralization everywhere; and secondarily to serve as the main base for a political party and more-intelligent voting bloc with respect to Gaia to save Gaia from itself.”\nJae Kwon on X\nIn related news, Kwon’s personal X account has apparently been blocked by the social media network for violating its terms of service. On Feb. 24, the account associated with JKwon, @jaekwon, posted that they would be using a new account, @donkeykwon, for personal communications.\nGoing forward @donkeykwon will be my personal Twitter, and @jaekwon will remain the crypto-focused Twitter that is shadowbanned. ;)\n— donkeykwon (@jaekwon) February 24, 2024\nJust three days later, as of the time of this article’s publication, the @donkeykwon account is no longer accessible.\nSource: X",

  "article_detailed_content": "Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to disrupt the centralized structure of the global asset protection industry. By taking advantage of Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI), Day By Day aims to deliver the way to more inclusive and democratized insurance.\nDespite its long history of providing financial security, the traditional insurance sector grapples with efficiency, transparency and security problems. As identified in the Aon report, the industry struggles to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, and challenges like demographic shifts and rising healthcare costs remain. Regulatory burdens are another issue, as highlighted by 80% of insurance CEOs believing over-regulation threatens growth.\nBlockchain stands as a beacon of hope in response to the inherent challenges of the insurance industry. Unlike traditional methods that rely on cumbersome paperwork and subjective assessments, blockchain promises to redefine the landscape of insurance through transparency, efficiency, security and accessibility.\nBuilding on the foundation laid by blockchain, the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) and AI further amplifies the potential for transformative change, enabling more nuanced risk assessments and personalized insurance products. Projects that leverage these technologies have a chance at overcoming historical challenges that have long plagued the insurance industry.\nThe monetization of insured assets\nDay By Day, a multichain Web3 insurance platform powered by AI, wants to revolutionize the insurance sector by combining the power of blockchain, RWAs and AI. The platform's users can secure their assets with an asset register app available on Google Play and the App Store.\nUpon creating an account, users can document their assets via photographs within the platform's proof-of-ownership consensus model. Users receive the platform's native digital asset, the DBD token, as a reward for every asset they register. The platform encourages holding DBD tokens with additional rewards and introduces the opportunity to purchase gift cards directly through the asset register app.\nDay By Day transforms nonfungible tokens (NFTs) into tangible insurance policy instruments. With this approach, individuals can hold NFTs as a means of securing insurance coverage and as an investment. Owners of policy NFTs with matching features also receive a share of the premiums collected from customers. Day By Day enables users to burn DBD tokens, effectively reducing the total supply in exchange for discounted rates on NFT policies.\nAt the heart of Day By Day’s structure is the Underwriting DeFi Pool model, which aims to act as a safeguard against unexpected events. The model allocates a significant portion of insurance premiums into accessible and locked liquidity pools. Pool contributors receive DBD-LP tokens, representing a stake that can be actively traded.\nThis approach ensures that half of the underwriting is always secured, protecting against smart contract vulnerabilities. Day By Day envisions the concept of underwriting as a chance, stating: ”Imagine everyone having the opportunity to invest like ‘Warren Buffett’ does in underwriting.”\nDay By Day simplifies insurance with its easy-to-use app. Source: Day By Day\nAfter an extensive four-and-a-half-year development period, Day By Day has achieved several milestones, including the launch of its DBD token, the launch of its mobile app to register real-world assets, NFTs as insurance policies for anyone to own, DeFi underwriting to cover claims and the introduction of native staking on the Polygon and Algorand networks. Day By Day's goal is to expand its vision to include digital asset protection for health, life, travel and niche markets supported by Web3 and AI.\nDecentralized insurance control\n“We don’t sell insurance,” said Bill Angelidis, CEO and founder of Day By Day, while encapsulating the ethos of Day By Day, adding:\n“People come to us to get protection for real-world assets that are valuable to them in a transparent, on-demand, personalized way like never before.”\nSupporting the CEO’s words, Day By Day is developing its Asset Protection Coverage feature. With this coverage system, customers will be able to choose the assets they want to protect, the events they want to preserve and the period they wish to cover.\nAdditionally, Day By Day plans to implement a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) project in the near future to democratize the insurance industry by giving all control authority to users.\nThe integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Web3 and AI, as showcased by innovative platforms like Day By Day, equips the insurance industry with tools to empower consumers and democratize access. This evolution paints the picture of a future where insurance is not only more transparent and personalized but also widely accessible, heralding a new era of consumer empowerment and industry innovation.\nLearn more about Day By Day\nDisclaimer.

  "article_detailed_content": "After GPU giant Nvidia announced breakout earnings last week, artificial intelligence (AI) crypto tokens have surged in value.\nAt the time of publication, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s Worldcoin (WLD) is currently trading at $8.04, representing a gain of 240% over the past month. Similarly, blockchain AI analytics firm Arkham Intelligence’s native token, ARKM, has gained 211% during the same period, with a current price of $1.68.\nOn Feb. 21, Nvidia announced revenue and earnings of $22.1 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, in Q4 2024, representing increases of 265% and 769% compared with Q4 2023. “Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point; demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, regarding the solid quarter.\nCrypto projects, too, are taking part in the AI tailwind.\nRecently, Sleepless — a Web3 AI companion platform backed by Binance Ventures — disclosed its roadmap for 2024. “Sleepless AI committed to offering authentic emotional communication through AI dialogue, AI voice, and other experiences that simulate interactions with real humans,” Sleepless said while teasing the release of its flagship AI blockchain game, Her 2.0, this year. Through the game, users will be able to dress their virtual partners, participate in player-vs-player battles, and earn rewards through card and mystery boxes. \nFetch.ai, an AI platform for building decentralized applications, revealed on Feb. 13 that it partnered with Deutsche Telecom for enterprise AI. As part of the agreement, Deutsche Telecom will become a validator on the Fetch.ai blockchain. “The core of this technology relies on AI-driven autonomous agents, which manage resources, conduct transactions, and analyze traffic flows. Fetch.ai services are currently accessible across various sectors, including healthcare, automotive, supply chain management, and digital identities,” Fetch.ai wrote. Deutsche Telekom MMS will also participate with Fetch.ai at the Bosch Connected Experience, Europe’s largest Internet of Things and AI hackathon, on February 28 and 29.\nMeanwhile, crypto exchange Bitget reported a 361% increase in weekly trading volume for its listed AI tokens and a 136% increase in the number of participants. “The main reason for the current rise in the AI sector is that OpenAI has launched its text-to-video model Sora, which has the ability to create videos up to 60 seconds long, including highly detailed scenes, complex camera movements, and emotionally rich characters. This innovation has enhanced the creativity of AI and attracted high attention from the market,\" researchers commented.\nSince 2020, decentralized computing blockchain iExecRLC has been part of Nvidia’s Inception Program for exploring AI edge computing. The project currently has a market capitalization of $323 million.\niExec has been selected to join the NVIDIA Inception Program.\n\nWith NVIDIA, iExec will explore how blockchain can leverage the AI Edge computing platform 'EGX' and accelerate the support of NVIDIA components in the Marketplace.@NVIDIA @NVIDIAAI https://t.co/pmXmEn0VX5\n— iExec RLC - Official (@iEx_ec) October 28, 2020\nCointelegraph reported on Feb. 20 that Y Combinator has called on startups to build stablecoin, metaverse and AI solutions. The Silicon Valley venture capital firm has funded 81 cryptocurrency and Web3 startups, including Coinbase, OpenSea, TRM Labs, and Quantstamp. Y Combinator analysts commented: \n“It all looks a bit like digital music’s transition from the realm of outlaw file sharing in the early 2000s to becoming the norm as players like Apple entered the market.\"\nRelated: Meta to combat generative-AI abuse ahead of EU parliament elections",

He wrote:\n“[Avail’s] stellar team, tech stack, and emerging ecosystem are enabling a more modular design space for projects to build on their infra. By decoupling the different layers of the blockchain, Avail unlocks orders of magnitude scalability improvements and helps solve the current fragmentation issues in the space.”\nAccording to Anurag Arjun, the co-founder of Avail, similar Web3 unification frameworks will become increasingly important as blockchain scaling becomes more reliant on layer-2 rollups. Arjun wrote:\n“Rollup tooling will mature to such an extent that it will be as easy to deploy an app-specific rollup as it is to deploy a smart contract today. In this world of 10s and 1,000s of chains, they will need to talk to each other seamlessly, otherwise this will lead to a huge user experience (UX) fragmentation issue.”\nThe total value locked (TVL) in L2 rollups is $24.93 billion at the time of writing, up 8.76% over the past week. Arbitrum One is the largest protocol, accounting for over 50% of the value locked in rollups, with a $12.98 billion TVL, according to L2Beat.\nLargest L2 rollups by TVL. Source: L2Beat\nAvail was launched by Polygon Labs in 2021 but was later spun off as a separate project. In July 2023, Avail released a testnet bridge to Ethereum to enable the creation of validiums, which are low-cost layer 2s that don’t store full transaction data on the main network. Avail is led by Arjun and former Polygon research lead Prabal Banerjee.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts.

Grace Pfluger, HBAR Foundation director of business development, said:\n“Public oracle price feeds are a critical component for growth as lending is often seen as the crux of economic behavior. This infrastructure is a huge milestone to spur development of innovative financial instruments on Hedera.”\nPyth price feeds will offer a pull oracle design to enable Hedera users and developers access to the latest price updates for over 400 ultra-low-latency price feeds across cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange, commodities, equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). \nRelated: Gary Gensler responds to US lawmakers over SEC’s false spot Bitcoin ETF tweet\nAnother service provided by Pyth price feeds is a confidence interval feature to inform downstream protocols about ongoing volatility and market dislocations.\nHLiquity — a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against Hedera’s (HBAR) token — will be the first application on Hedera to integrate with Pyth data. HLiquity helps track the current prices of HBAR and Swiss franc prices to ensure that user vaults and the overall protocol remain overcollateralized.\nThe Pyth Network is a first-party financial oracle network that provides low-latency real-world data to multiple blockchains. On Feb. 20, it announced the launch of price feeds for 13 Bitcoin ETFs. According to the company, the feeds could help decentralized finance platforms expand portfolio options, improve risk mitigation strategies and enhance liquidity by potentially attracting institutional capital on-chain.\nIn January 2024, the Hedera Global Governing Council, which oversees the Hedera network, approved the allocation of 4.86 billion HBAR, worth roughly $408 million, for further development and advanced decentralized governance. The funds are part of Hedera’s goal to strengthen its base following its 2023 performance, with over 33 billion real-world transactions on the network.\nMagazine: 5,050 Bitcoin for $5 in 2009: Helsinki’s claim to crypto fame",

The crypto subsidiary was established last year after the cryptocurrency brokerage firm acquired a majority stake in Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)-registered Coinpass.\nThe new crypto trading platform will offer trading services for over 63 cryptocurrency pairs, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with plans to add more tokens and features in the coming years.\nOANDA’s recent expansion in the U.K. comes more than a year after the firm opened crypto trading services in the U.S. in partnership with Paxos, a popular crypto trading platform. The firm recently moved its European operations away from Malta to Warsaw in Poland, acquiring Polish broker Dom Maklerski TMS Brokers SA, which was later rebranded to OANDA TMS.\nThe crypto brokerage firm has often chosen regions with strict regulatory requirements, first the U.S. and now the United Kingdom. Several leading crypto companies have withdrawn their services in the U.K. since October 2023 after FCA’s new regulatory guidelines on crypto advertising. Crypto firms such as Bybit and Revolut temporarily suspended their operations in the U.K. last year, citing the new FCA promotion rules.\nRelated: Controversial UK legislation creates ‘positive frictions’ for crypto users\nThe new advertising rules only allow FCA-registered virtual asset service providers to promote their activities in the country. The rules also require crypto firms to adapt their online platforms significantly to better warn potential customers of investment risks.\nThe FCA found “significant levels of non-compliance” from crypto firms in violation of the crypto promotion rules that came into effect on Oct. 8, 2023. The regulator highlighted that between Oct. 8 and Dec. 31, 2023, it issued 450 consumer alerts against virtual asset companies illegally promoting crypto.\nOn the other hand, OANDA’s head of digital assets, Lucian Lauerman, called the U.K. market a very well-educated and active market. He added that the market is becoming “more aligned with the markets where we’ve traditionally operated.

  "article_detailed_content": "Blockchain-based extraction shooter game Shrapnel identified numerous users trying “to gain an unfair advantage in matches” and warned of a permanent ban against all forms of manipulation.\nShrapnel users were found using two illegal strategies — teaming and account sharing — to rank higher on the leaderboard during one of its early access gameplay events. Several Web3 gamers teamed up and coordinated their queues to take down other players, which highly impacts solo players.\nAdditionally, users were found accessing the same player account from multiple devices, implying an unfair advantage through teamwork. The company’s statement added:\n“This includes but is not limited to sharing login credentials, giving access to in-game characters, items, or progress to others, or using another person’s account.”\nShrapnel revealed that it has systems in place to detect the aforementioned anomalies, which violate the game’s terms of use while warning, “Any players found to be violating our Terms of Use will be removed from the current STX leaderboard and considered for a permanent ban.”\nImportant Announcement for Shrapnel STX Players!  \n\nWe want to address some concerning behavior that we've identified within our community. As we continue our journey through the early alpha playtest STX events, it's crucial to ensure fair play and maintain the integrity of… pic.twitter.com/TYZizkVRpi\n— SHRAPNEL (@playSHRAPNEL) February 24, 2024\nThey also encouraged players to report any instances of abuse as the game prepares to go fully live:\n“It’s essential that we identify and rectify all issues before the game transitions to fully live status, especially as players begin extracting with NFTs and other digital assets.”\nHowever, a community member said the decision “penalizes” the guilds and communities that prefer playing team matches. Responding to the criticism, Shrapnel said that it would remove only the users who are found unfairly coordinating to climb the leaderboard and not those playing with their friends.\nRelated: EigenLayer partners with Ritual to build AI-enabled DApps\nIn September 2023, Shrapnel decided to bar users in the United States from cashing out in-game assets owing to regulatory complications with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the game will remain unrestricted for players from Europe and Asia.\nIn a Sept. 13, 2023, interview with Cointelegraph, Shrapnel head of economy Francis Brankin said:\n“They [U.S. users] can do everything every other player can do, but they can’t cash out. Because that’s what makes it a security to the U.S. player: As soon as they can realize monetary value, that’s where the problem comes in.”\nHowever, Brankin hopes the issue will be temporary, and Neon — the team behind Shrapnel — will soon enable U.S. users to bridge capital accrued from Shrapnel to their bank accounts.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana’s stablecoin volume",

  "article_detailed_content": "Decentralized blockchain platform Aleo revealed some users’ information on Feb. 25, according to reports on X (formerly Twitter). The platform focuses on zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography and uses a third-party protocol for Know Your Customer (KYC).\nA user named Emir Soytürk said Aleo mistakenly sent KYC documents to his email. These documents included selfies and ID card photos of another person, making him concerned about the security of his own information.\nAnother user, Selim C, confirmed the claim, stating that he also got the KYC documents of another person in his email.\nTo claim a reward on Aleo, users must complete KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements and pass the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) screening in accordance with Aleo’s internal policies. Users must complete this process when signing up for HackerOne, a third-party protocol to collect users’ unencrypted KYC data.\nScreenshot of Aleo user complaints on X platform. Source: Inversebrah\nRelated: Citrea raises $2.7M in seed funding to launch Bitcoin ZK-rollup\nZK layer-1 blockchain platforms focus on providing enhanced privacy and security for users. They employ ZK-proof cryptographic techniques to enable transactions without revealing specific details, ensuring confidentiality.\nThis privacy-centric approach makes it challenging for external parties to trace or access sensitive information, offering users greater control over their data. These platforms aim to enhance privacy in blockchain transactions, making them securer and more confidential for participants.\nCointelegraph spoke to Mike Sarvodaya, founder of Galactica — a layer-1 blockchain infrastructure — who explained that such a protocol should never theoretically allow access to user data. He said:\n“It’s ironic that a protocol for programmable privacy uses a third party to collect users’ unencrypted KYC data after that leaks to the public. Apparently, when your ZK stack is so advanced, you might just forget how to practice basic opsec.”\nAccording to Sarvodaya, the Aleo case ironically underscores the significance of creating storage and proof systems for sensitive data — like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) — based on ZK or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In such systems, protocol rules must ensure that no single party can reveal stored data.\nThe Aleo mainnet is set to launch in the next few weeks, once some final bugs have been taken care of, to bring privacy to crypto transactions, as stated by Aleo Foundation executive director Alex Pruden in an interview with The Block.\nMagazine: What did Satoshi Nakamoto think about ZK-proofs?",

  "article_detailed_content": "A litany of insights into the early days of cryptocurrency were recently revealed when Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s earliest collaborator, Martti Malmi, published 120 pages of email correspondences between the two on GitHub on Feb. 23.\nMy email correspondence with Satoshi in 2009-2011: https://t.co/jyoX8gXckp\n— Martti Malmi (@marttimalmi) February 23, 2024\nThe true identity of Nakamoto remains a point of conjecture throughout the greater cryptocurrency and blockchain community. However, the emails recently published on GitHub by Malmi were initially introduced as evidence in a London court case brought by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance against Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Nakamoto.\nEmail from Satoshi Nakamoto to Malmi. Source: Satoshi - Sirius emails 2009-2011\nBased on Cointelegraph’s cursory examination of the emails, there are no smoking guns or tell-tale revelations that would immediately shine a light on Satoshi’s true identity. But for historians and Bitcoin lore enthusiasts, the emails include many fantastic quotes and a general air of Satoshi-ness — that same straightforward, simple-yet-comprehensive, no-nonsense style that permeates the Bitcoin white paper.\nSatoshi believed #Bitcoin mining would be less energy intensive than the legacy banking system.\n\nNote: This is by far his best new quote pic.twitter.com/FsCxJlj8Xf\n— Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) February 23, 2024\nSatoshi on “cryptocurrency”\nWhile it’s long been posited that Satoshi themselves came up with the term “cryptocurrency,” one email sent to Malmi on June 11, 2009, appears to poke a major hole in this theory.\nPer Satoshi:\n“Someone came up with the word ‘cryptocurrency.’ [...] Maybe it’s a word we should use when describing Bitcoin, do you like it?”\nTo Malmi’s credit, he responded that “it sounds good” and added that it sounded more interesting than “digital P2P cash.”\nSatoshi on anonymity\nMalmi’s email correspondence also demonstrates Satoshi’s keen understanding of anonymity, what it meant and what the risks of misinformation could mean for Bitcoin.\nAs Satoshi wrote in one email:\n“I think we should de-emphasize the anonymous angle. With the popularity of bitcoin addresses instead of sending by IP, we can’t give the impression it’s automatically anonymous. It’s possible to be pseudonymous, but you have to be careful.”\nThe email continues to essentially predict the rise of blockchain forensics:\n\"If someone digs through the transaction history and starts exposing information people thought was anonymous, the backlash will be much worse if we haven’t prepared expectations by warning in advance that you have to take precautions.”",

Seems to be related to a new inscription wave launched about an hour ago.\n— Kevin Sekniqi (@kevinsekniqi) February 23, 2024\nOn Feb. 23 at 12:02:27 pm UTC, Avalanche’s primary network experienced block production issues, seemingly halting the network. Avalanche’s blockchain explorer showed that the last block on Avalanche’s P-Chain, X-Chain and C-chain subnets was produced over an hour earlier. Avalanche also put out an official alert related to the block finalization stall. In a status update, Avalanche wrote:  \n“Developers across the community are currently investigating a stall in block finalization that is preventing blocks from being accepted on the Primary Network.” \nBlock production is an important process for the stability and continuity of blockchain networks. It involves the inception of new blocks that validate and record transactions. Interruptions in the block production process result in delays in transaction processing, impacting the overall functionality of the network. \nIn an X post, Kevin Sekniqi, the co-founder of Ava Labs, said the team is already investigating the issue. According to Sekniqi, the halt in block production may be connected to a “new inscription wave” launched an hour before the problems surfaced. \nRelated: Sports Illustrated moves NFT ticketing platform to Avalanche\nThe Ava Labs executive believes that the issue might be an “esoteric bug from some edge case” and mentioned that the issue is likely a mempool handling issue with inscriptions. Sekniqi assured the community that this would be “handled quickly.”\nNearly an hour later, Sekniqi clarified that the issue was a code-related bug unrelated to performance handling. The executive explained that inscriptions may have hit the edge case but did not affect performance. \nClarification on this: the issue seems to be a gossip-related mempool management bug, which is purely a code-related bug, and not an issue with performance handling. Inscriptions seem to have hit the edge case, but inscriptions did not affect performance. https://t.co/9cvQSAmTVu\n— Kevin Sekniqi (@kevinsekniqi) February 23, 2024\nSimilar reports on Avalanche’s block production halting surfaced on March 23, 2023. At the time, the Avalanche blockchain explorer showed that the C-chain stopped producing blocks. However, Sekniqi explained that the network had been unstable due to a bug with its v1.9.12, and the team deployed a fix to stabilize the network.\nMagazine: Real AI & crypto use cases, No. 4: Fight AI fakes with blockchain",

  "article_detailed_content": "Mining helps verify the legitimacy of transactions conducted via a blockchain network, such as the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners can start mining cryptocurrencies using hardware like a central processing unit (CPU) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Alternatively, they can use smartphones powered by Android and iOS systems to mine the cryptocurrencies of their choice.\nWhile technically possible, mining cryptocurrencies on smartphones is generally impractical and inefficient. So, how about an innovative approach to mining and network infrastructure via a decentralized wireless network? Strange as it may sound, miners can mine cryptocurrencies without relying on expensive infrastructure. Helium Network has made it possible by allowing nodes to act as hotspot devices.\nThis article will discuss the Helium ecosystem, Helium mining, the HNT hotspot miner and how a Helium miner works.\nWhat is the Helium network?\nHelium is a dispersed network of hotspots that offers LoRaWAN-capable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a long-range wireless service publicly accessible by global citizens. LoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network, and IoT devices may communicate with one another via LoRa thanks to the open LoRaWAN protocol. IoT devices are smart “gadgets” that connect to a network and exchange data, offering a more comprehensive range of connectivity than WiFi.\nHelium blockchain was developed exclusively to encourage the development of real, decentralized wireless networks. Helium uses HNT (Helium) tokens as its primary cryptocurrency. However, the project migrated to the Solana blockchain in April 2023. \nThis move made HNT natively compatible with projects — i.e., interoperability — within the Solana ecosystem while jacking up the utility of MOBILE and IOT tokens (other Helium tokens). MOBILE tokens aim to make creating and operating decentralized wireless networks seamless, with a particular emphasis on 5G and cellular services. By providing incentives for establishing and maintaining mobile data transmission infrastructure, MOBILE tokens allow for a decentralized method of cellular access. \nThe purpose of IOT tokens is to facilitate the IoT component of the Helium network. They ensure robust and extensive coverage for low-power Internet of Things devices by encouraging and facilitating the operation of LoRaWAN hotspots and related services. The IOT tokens greatly enhance the network’s utility and reach for IoT applications.\nFurthermore, Solana’s architecture makes faster transaction speeds and more efficiency possible, incorporating innovations like proof-of-history (PoH). This is advantageous for the real-time needs of IoT devices and networks.\nHotspots and network participation\nWith Helium, anyone can own and manage a wireless IoT network using a unique, portable radio router known as a hotspot. Hotspots are wireless plug-and-play devices that offer superior connectivity to WiFi. \nHotspots are used by miners to build “The People’s Network,” a long-range wireless network that provides coverage for IoT devices with meager power requirements in exchange for HNT, the Helium blockchain’s native cryptocurrency. The Helium community has permitted third-party manufacturers to sell a range of Helium hotspots.\nProof-of-coverage (PoC) mechanism\nProof-of-coverage (PoC), a novel work algorithm, is used by the Helium blockchain to confirm that hotspots accurately describe their location and the wireless network coverage they are generating from it. Radio waves are used during the mining process, and hotspots are rewarded for acting as witnesses for peers’ performance, completing PoC challenges and sharing device data. The most valuable tool for viewing data linked to PoC is the Helium Network Explorer.\nWhen the Helium network debuted in 2019, it employed a PoC system based on a sophisticated model comprising Challenger, Beaconer, Witness, Validator and Rewarder roles. This model aimed to accurately validate the geographical locations of hotspots and the corresponding wireless coverage they provided. As the network expanded rapidly and diversified, the complexity and sophistication of attempts to exploit the system increased, necessitating adaptations to maintain integrity and effectiveness.\nAs a result, Helium Improvement Proposal 70 introduced an oracle-based PoC system to streamline the process. In this system, hotspots are responsible for their own beacon transmissions, and a decentralized group of oracles validates PoC events. This reduces the network’s overhead and improves scalability and efficiency.\nAdvantages of the Helium Network\nPros of the Helium Network over a standard internet service provider include a high level of security, complete encryption and affordable universal internet access. Moreover, Helium’s decentralized architecture leverages the shared infrastructure of hotspots run by businesses and consumers to offer more affordable connection solutions, especially for IoT devices. This may make accessing the internet more accessible for those in rural or underserved areas.\nAdditionally, users do not need to bear charges that a cellular provider might impose, such as coverage fees or the cost of extra hardware like a SIM card. That said, users only pay for the data they used to connect their devices — i.e., pay-per-use — using the Helium Console to begin using the Helium Network.\nHelium supports cutting-edge technologies like LoRaWAN for low-power devices, making it an ideal platform for many IoT applications, from smart agriculture to urban planning. Also, Helium empowers its users to be a part of the network’s expansion, offering incentives for hotspot hosts in the form of HNT rewards. This community-driven approach fosters a collaborative ecosystem.\nWhat is a Helium miner?\nUtilizing specialized hardware known as hotspots, Helium miners offer the Helium network wireless network coverage. By acquiring or constructing a WHIP-compliant hotspot and staking a token deposit corresponding to the density of other miners operating in their area, users become miners on the Helium network. WHIP stands for Wireless Hardware Interface Protocol.\nIn addition to the blockchain protocol, the Helium Wireless protocol called WHIP, a network of independent providers rather than a single coordinator, offers a bi-directional data transfer method between wireless devices and the internet. \nThe responsibility of validating hotspots to ensure that device data reaches its intended destination and that miners receive compensation for their services lies with internet applications known as routers — aka Helium Network servers. These routers purchase encrypted device data from miners, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data transmission within the network.\nIn the Helium network, hotspots are of three types, as explained below:\nFull hotspots: These hotspots maintain a full copy of the HNT blockchain and receive rewards for all participation activities, including proof-of-coverage and data transfer.\nLight hotspots: With the help of the Light Hotspot software, these hotspots use validators to participate as full hotspots without incurring the additional costs of keeping a local copy of the blockchain. In addition, they are rewarded for proof-of-coverage and data transfer activities.\nData-only hotspots: These hotspots provide data transfer capabilities for the network without participating in PoC challenges. As a result, they are rewarded for data transfer activities only.\nHow does Helium mining work?\nRadiowave technology is utilized to carry out Helium mining instead of CPUs or ASICs. In addition, blockchain technology is used to create a wireless network that is more reliable than the network provided by established traditional wireless service providers. However, it is important to note that reliability can be subjective and context-dependent, varying based on network density, hotspot distribution and other factors.\nHelium hotspots or miners provide long-range wireless coverage using special devices called LoRaWAN transmitters. So, how can one earn Helium tokens in return? By mining and expanding The People’s Network’s coverage with suitable hotspots, miners gain HNT. The reward amount is correlated with the data a miner will transfer — i.e., more money when miners transfer more device data. Other factors influencing HNT rewards include the number of devices served and the miner’s participation in PoC challenges. \nIn addition, the network automatically and randomly assigns proof-of-coverage tests to verify the location of hotspots (witnesses). Hotspots get directives or “challenges” from validators to communicate payloads to any nearby hotspots for observation and verification to participate in PoC. These difficulties are also referred to as “beacons.” However, as they can only mine HNT for data transfers and cannot have their beacons confirmed, HNT hotspot miners without neighbors get paid less.\nMoreover, each compatible device needs data credits (DCs) to send data to the internet. DCs are created by burning HNT to achieve a burn and mint equilibrium (BME), which ensures a balance between the creation of new HNT through mining and the removal of HNT from circulation through the burning process. The BME model uses tokens as a proprietary form of payment, but customers who wish to use a service do not directly pay a counterparty. Instead, they burn tokens. \nHow to set up a Helium miner?\nAs mentioned in the above sections, a hotspot miner, antenna (and its location), cables, smartphone and router are the prerequisites to set up a Helium miner. But how does one find the best Helium miner? The position of antennas and one’s geographical location play a key role in finding a suitable Helium miner. The below steps provide an understanding of how one can set up a Helium miner:\nStep 1: Download and set up a Helium app\nThe first step involves downloading the Helium app (available for Android and iOS) and setting up an account. After this, a Helium wallet will be generated that users can utilize to store their information.\nThe application will generate a 12-word seed phrase to back up the Helium wallet. The app will also prompt the user to create a six-digit PIN that must be entered each time when logging in as an additional security measure. \nStep 2: Add a Helium miner\nThe next step is to find out the plus (+) symbol to add a Helium miner, for example, the RAK Hotspot Miner, to the app. The chosen miner needs to be plugged in to operate, and a tiny red light will confirm that it is working. Then, a button on the back of the device needs to be pressed for Bluetooth pairing. Alternatively, WiFi can be configured by choosing from the available network settings in the Helium app. \nIt should be noted that it is essential to choose a Helium miner that is reliable and approved by the Helium community. Potential buyers should look for hotspots that are compatible with their region’s frequency and have a good track record of performance and support.\nStep 3: Select the hotspot, verify its location, and set up the antenna\nNow, the list will include the chosen Hotspot Miner. To proceed, the user selects “Hotspot.” A prompt to add a hotspot will then appear. The user adds the hotspot, verifies the hotspot’s location, and configures the antenna.\nThe first assertion is free (paid by manufacturers), and users are responsible for paying the transaction fee (in HNT) for further assertions. If the user still needs to get ready to set a location, they can press “Skip.” If you are good to go, select “Continue.” The added Hotspot can be viewed and managed under the Hotspots tab of the mobile app.\nAfter the hotspot is added and its location is asserted, it will begin to participate in the network activities, including PoC challenges and data transfer, earning HNT based on its performance.\nHow to optimize your Helium miner setup\nThe goal of optimizing a Helium miner setup is to maximize the radio frequency signal reach of the hotspot. Orienting the antenna to its highest point — ideally outside or close to a window — will help it stay clear of obstacles and improve its line of sight to neighboring hotspots. \nThe power and coverage of the signal can be greatly increased by using a high-gain antenna compatible with the frequency band used in the area. For the antenna to be protected from static damage and lightning strikes, it must be properly grounded. \nFurthermore, updating the firmware of the hotspot to the most recent version ensures the best performance and security. In addition, it is crucial to consider the density of hotspots in the area; too close may result in signal overlap, while too far may make it impossible to take part in PoC challenges. Effective management of these factors can substantially boost the effectiveness and earnings of a Helium miner setup.\nThe future of the Helium network\nThe future of the Helium network looks promising, with its migration to Solana offering users enhanced support through both hardware and software wallets and integration with a wide array of Solana ecosystem applications. Despite the migration, HNT, MOBILE and IOT tokens retain their significance within the Helium ecosystem, unaffected by Solana’s native SOL (SOL) token.\nThe introduction of 5G and the transition to Solana as the primary blockchain layer have not altered the dynamics between MOBILE and HNT tokens. 5G hotspot owners will continue earning MOBILE tokens, while HNT holders can still stake their tokens. \nThe Helium network’s IoT and 5G segments are poised for growth, benefiting from the increased reliability and scalability offered by the new architecture. Innovations like the Solana Mobile Stack and Saga Phone are set to enrich the mobile experience within the ecosystem, further expanding Helium’s capabilities and reach.",

  "article_detailed_content": "Two crypto wallet addresses belonging to Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin, one of the five co-founders of Axie Infinity and Ronin Network, were hacked, and roughly $9.7 million worth of Ether (ETH) was stolen and siphoned across Tornado Cash. \nOn Feb. 23, blockchain investigator PeckShield alerted about a “whale wallet” compromise over the Ronin Bridge, reporting that the hacker made away with 3,248 ETH. Aleksander Larsen, co-founder of Ronin Network, immediately responded that “the (Ronin) bridge itself has top security” and suspected a wallet hack instead.\n#PeckShieldAlert It appears a whale wallet has been compromised, & ~3,248 $ETH (worth ~$9.7m) from the #Ronin Bridge was withdrawn and transferred to #TornadoCash pic.twitter.com/sRK36BQFDu\n— PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) February 23, 2024\nLarsen also highlighted that the Ronin Bridge had been audited and is designed to pause if an unusually large withdrawal is detected. Soon after, Zirlin confirmed that two of his personal wallets had been hacked. He said the attack was not due to vulnerabilities within the Ronin chain or Sky Mavis operations, adding:\n“I want to assure everyone that we have strict security measures in place for all chain-related activities.”\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, PeckShield said that the root cause of the hack was a “wallet compromise,” which allowed the unauthorized outbound transfer of funds.\nThis has been a tough morning for me. \n\nTwo of my addresses have been compromised.\n\nThe attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain.\n\nAdditionally, the leaked keys have nothing to do with Sky Mavis operations.…\n— Jihoz.ron (@Jihoz_Axie) February 23, 2024\nWhile no particular details were shared about the events that led to the hack, Zirlin’s message suggests that the private keys of the two wallets were leaked, which led to unauthorized access to his personal crypto wallets.\nFunds stolen from Axie Infinity’s Jihoz were transferred to Tornado Cash. Source: PeckShield\nPeckShield’s investigation of the compromised wallets from Ronin Bridge v2 suggests that the 3,248-ETH loot was initially split and moved to three different wallets. The funds eventually made their way into Tornado Cash, a service often used by hackers to anonymize the funds’ ownership and traceability.\nRelated: Coordinated crypto hack and phishing campaign floods investor emails: Alert\nOn Feb. 1, Binance froze $4.2 million worth of stolen XRP (XRP), a part of the $112-million hack on Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen’s personal wallet from Jan. 31.\nAfter finding out early on about the exploit that occurred at @Ripple, we’re happy to say that the #Binance team has managed to freeze $4.2 Million worth of $XRP stolen by the exploiter.\n\nWe appreciate both the communities efforts in flagging it to exchanges - as always @zachxbt…\n— Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) February 1, 2024\nUnlike Axie Infinity’s Jihoz hacker, Larsen’s hacker didn’t use crypto mixer services or decentralized exchanges to hide their identity. As a result, Binance was able to track down some of the funds and block them from the hacker’s access.\nMagazine: Wealthy, isolated, and incredible beaches: Perth Crypto City Guide",
