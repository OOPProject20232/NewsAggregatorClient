The Lightning Network speeds up Bitcoin transactions.\n\n**On-chain vs Off-chain, what\u2019s the difference?**\n\n**On-chain:** Transactions that happen on the original Bitcoin Blockchain. Slower, more expensive, more secure, and has transparency.\n\n**Off-chain:** Transactions that happen on the side of the blockchain. Typically faster, cheaper, not as secure, and has less transparency.\n\n\\*Off-chain transactions typically use technologies called L2\u2019s or layer 2\u2019s. This just means you have your original Network, like the Bitcoin blockchain that nearly everyone uses. This is a Laye 1 or L1. Then these technologies are built on top of these L1 networks and work with the original blockchain but do most of their transactions on the side on this L2.\n\nThe \u201clightning network\u201d is a technology built on top of Bitcoin. Some smart group created this \u201cthing\u201d or software that basically was built on top of how Bitcoin works. Instead of taking 10 minutes and costing a couple of dollars, it sends in seconds and costs pennies.\n\n**How?** In short, instead of using the Bitcoin Network for every transaction, you\u2019re kinda transacting on the side, or \u201coff-chain\u201d then eventually going back to the original Bitcoin network.\n\nNow, what\u2019s the catch? It\u2019s technically not as secure as the original Bitcoin network, and it could be difficult to set up.\n\n**So, The Lightning Network is software built on Bitcoin that is faster and cheaper but less secure, that eventually goes back to the original Bitcoin network.**","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1co5uvt/lightning_network_on_bitcoin/","author":"Arrakeen_eth","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T02:36:15Z","categories":["general"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/Bitcoin"},{"post_title":"Accepting bitcoin as payment","post_content":"I\u2019m currently looking for options to accept bitcoin at my business. \n\nWhat options are others using?","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1co5nk1/accepting_bitcoin_as_payment/","author":"KingVargeras","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T02:27:43Z","categories":["general"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/Bitcoin"},{"post_title":"Can anyone tell me how this wallet address was provided by Robinhood?","post_content":"My mother created a Robinhood account to transfer BTC from Coinbase to Robinhood.\n\nRobinhood Provided the following address for a bitcoin transfer: 3CTDKYLTiB6ia3ZvPQGHoeWBS4HbT8uyMX\n\nThat wallet transferred the received BTC to the wallet address:\nbc1qdfl3dfnwwvlqa5jpckh0ccwpjczh5y566c4g76\n\nHer Robinhood wallet address is now different than that original address provided.

They call it Tetherpocalypse.\n\nBut is it still gonna be as bad as the original theory portrayed it?\n\nAfter all, the Tetherpocalypse theory came from a fear that too much of the trading volume was done in just Tether, at a time when Tether was the only relevant stablecoin, and had essentially all the trading volume. Which is no longer the case.\n\nTether still has a big share of the stablecoin volume at $3,000B of the trading volume.\n\nBut USDC and FDUSD are catching up every year, and now have $1,400B of the trading volume combined. Closing in on nearly half of Tether's volume.\n\nSomething we've never had in the early years of Tether.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n50wnvofnfzc1.jpg?width=1260&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=922d5bc915cb3a366b7b544d3f957b5b1010f345\n\nTether's dominance of the stablecoin market went from over 90%, to now dropping to around 60-70%, and if the trend continues, will likely continue to drop.\n\n# What happens when a stablecoin collapses: the lessons from the TerraUSD UST collapse.\n\n**1- UST and the numbers.**\n\nPanic and depegging.\n\nIt wasn't just UST that was depegging, but other stablecoin initially started to depeg, and then managed to quickly re-peg.\n\nBitcoin dropped from $39K to $28K in the initial drop, and further dropped to $19K from this black swan event. However, the market was already in a bear market, and sentiments were already bearish.\n\nIt was a black swan event the likes of which we've seen during the Hash Wars in 2018.\n\nBut it wasn't a total apolypse of crypto.\n\nA lot of the stablecoin volume simply transfered to USDT, USDC, DAI, etc... USDC saw a surge of more than 4x its volume at the time, while Tether doubled.\n\nNow, UST was only $18B at the time. While USDT was at $80B\n\nSo Terra was more than 4 times smaller.\n\nBut an $18B market cap stablecoin is no small fry. That's the volume of Tether 2 years before in 2020.\n\n**2- The collapse of Tether.**\n\nIf Tether collapsed completely the same way Terra did, it would be much larger, mainly because of its over 60% volume of all the trading.\n\nIt would be a black swan event out-doing the Hash Wars and Terra Luna, by quiet a margin.\n\nWill it be a total Tetherpocalypse and end of crypto? Or something to a higher level than Mt Gox?\n\nProbably not the end of crypto.\n\nAs we've seen in the Terra collapse, there's other stablecoins that volume can run to. Other stablecoins that have taken an increasingly larger slice of the market on exchanges over the years, and growing rapidly.\n\nIt will still be much worse than what we've seen with Terra UST, but the market has grown since. And we've also seen how quickly non-algo stablecoin can re-peg, compared to UST.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the Terra Luna fiasco and collapse happened several months into a bear market, when fears were already high. Likely amplifying the fear and panic inherent at the time. If Tether would collapse during a bull market, at the height of blind bullishness, the story could be different than a collapse during a bear market.\n\n\n\n# But can Tether even collapse like TerraUSD UST?\n\nProbably not, since Tether is not an algorithmic stablecoin.\n\nThe issue with Terra UST, is that it was an algorithmic stablecoin. That's why it wasn't able to repeg, and spiral led down and completely collapsed.\n\nThe system of UST had a flaw, where it could just continuously depeg.\n\nOn the other hand, Tether is more of a ....fixed stablecoin. Maybe even a fraudulent stablecoin. People always complain about how Tether is rigged, and they're right. But that very control they have and the way it's rigged, is also what's gonna make it harder for it to collapse, and why it has been so resilient. In a system run on bullshit, you only need to sprinkle more pixie dust to keep it going.\n\nThere is a control they have for supply and demand, where they can burn Tether or mint Tether to adjust to the market.\n\nWhat would cause a Tether collapse? We only know what *won't* collapse it, from what we've seen so far: a bear market, a pandemic, a war, a major exchange collapse, a recession, a stock bear market, a major crypto collapse, regulation crackdown, crypto ban FUD, a stablecoin causing a depegging panic, etc....\n\nSo what's really left to cause a collapse?\n\nThat's not to say Tether won't collapse.\n\nBut it may not be in the glorious way Terra collapsed. If Tether collapses, it will more likely be a long slow collapse over the years, just losing dominance cycle over cycle.","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1co3on2/time_to_revise_the_tetherpocalypse_theory_2_years/","author":"fan_of_hakiksexydays","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T01:06:01Z","categories":["perspective"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"OKX Ventures Announces Investment in Wild Forest","post_content":"","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1co3fyd/okx_ventures_announces_investment_in_wild_forest/","author":"Deep-Cow9096","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T00:56:12Z","categories":["project-update"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"FTX says it plans to pay back most customers","post_content":"","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1co33yv/ftx_says_it_plans_to_pay_back_most_customers/","author":"Electrical_Tension","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T00:42:08Z","categories":["general-news"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"Trump NFT Prices Double as Jimmy Kimmel Calls Collectors 'Freaks' and 'Suckers'","post_content":"","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1co2p98/trump_nft_prices_double_as_jimmy_kimmel_calls/","author":"Beyonderr","up_votes":398,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-10T00:24:16Z","categories":["general-news"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"What's next, now that the 4th bitcoin halving has passed?","post_content":"","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1co1ngo/whats_next_now_that_the_4th_bitcoin_halving_has/","author":"GalileosTele","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-09T23:39:19Z","categories":["analysis"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"Why do exchanges keep suspending my accounts?","post_content":"For example.

Last year I made about $30k and am on track to make about $100-200k depending on how the price of everything performs on this bull run. I've been torn between retaining my growing stake or converting it to ETH and start running validator nodes to continue growing a recurring passive income base or cash everything out to pay off the student loans / car loans of me and my spouse...\n\nThe revenue I generate right now is based on the shaky basis of a few large delegators to my node and could go away at any point. That reality is stressing me out since I don't see it as that I'll have this forever. I am torn between trying to build up my own stake in the currency to make myself self-sufficient, turning up nodes on other protocols to diversify, go all in to ETH and set myself up for running validators or realize the gains and just pay off my real life debt now and cash in while I have it possible...

The name \"polytopia\" is a placeholder... inspired by an old blog post from Wildcat2030: [https://polytopia.org/](https://polytopia.org/).\n\nThe video pseudonym parties that I first conceptualized in 2015 and that many have likely heard about, is the only good \"alternative population register\" mechanism I'm aware of. The design was finished by 2015, and implementation mostly finished by 2020. Then, the parts of the \"people-vote Nakamoto consensus\" were mostly conceptualized 2016-2017, with the random number generator mechanism Panarchy uses conceptualized in the summer 2020 (has other idea prior to that that was similar to RANDAO or what Ethereum proof-of-stake now uses. ) The tax-per-second (often called \"demurrage\" I think) was conceptualized in 2019, and can be implemented in 15 lines of code. A sophisticated tax vote mechanism was added now, that seemed ideal (and the taxation then also needs to handle changing tax-rate which makes it slightly more than 15 lines of code... ) I've built a simple UI with an \"account explorer\" backend, possibly not the best way to do it but it works as  a start. The logo is a placeholder and the lower half of the Ethereum logo (an upside down pyramid... ) The people-vote consensus engine conforms to the Go-Ethereum consensus engine interface, not perfectly so some things are \"forced\" a bit (works well, but the interface is not ideal for this system). Any country in the world could use something very similar (although would better use the RANDAO-like RNG then. ) Block explorer up and running with TryEthernal. Sharing here if anyone interested.
