They even believe that it is almost impossible to make money in this field. Stories of bad projects and scams, but also of actually good projects that still didn't work out due to \"unfortunate coincidences\".\n\nI too have often been in the situation where I was convinced that I had found the one project that would finally make me rich, only to realize that I was way too late to a party that was only based on fake hype and lies. In hindsight, it always feels like it was just bad luck, like the one whale who sold too early caused everything to go down the drain. Or that the team started marketing a week too early or too late. Or that the community wasn't active enough.\n\nToday I want to explain to you why you've only made losses with memecoins so far and how you can find the one coin you've been looking for all this time. Because it's not a game of chance, you just have to know what to look out for.\n\n1) Even with memecoins there is no quick money \n\nIf you think you're going to invest in a project today and drive a Lambo to work next week, you should quickly abandon this hope. Of course, there are projects that make 50x or 100x within a few days of launch and if you had bought here at the beginning, you would have become a millionaire with \u20ac1,000. But these are not the projects we are looking for, because hundreds of these projects are launched every day and only a fraction of them achieve this kind of development. This type of investment is nothing more than gambling. We are looking for projects like SHIB, PEPE or WIF - projects that establish a solid holder base over a long period of time and only really take off after several weeks.\n\n\n2) Trust in the team is the most important foundation\n\nIf the community does not trust the team, the project cannot succeed. Not a single project only goes up, it is simply part of the nature of crypto that there are also red days. And as soon as the price of a coin drops, investors start to become insecure, get scared, start to ask questions in the chat and keep pointing out mistakes. It takes a lot of courage to stick with a project where your investment is 50%, 60%, 70% in the red. In these times, the only certainty you have is the community's trust in the team and the shared belief that things will go in the other direction again. Of course, you can never be 100% sure that the team is trustworthy, but there are a few facts you can use as a guide. For example, a doxxed dev with previous successful projects is a good indication. The same goes for locked liquidity and locked team tokens. KYC and successful listings on well-known CEXs are also good guarantees. All these things are not only security for yourself, but also increase the likelihood that the community will not lose hope during red days.\n\n3) The community must have a common goal and grow together\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, everyone has the same goal: to become rich with the investment. But there needs to be a more concrete goal, a narrative. For example, to become the first cat token to reach the $1 billion market cap. These common goals weld people together and lead to the community becoming creative on its own initiative in order to achieve this goal. Joint raids, funny memes and community giveaways. These are the things that differentiate good coins from bad coins and they must be intrinsically motivated by the community. The project has to be fun and it will only be fun if not everyone just stares at the chart every day, but contributes to the project.\n\nIf you want to see an example of a project where all these points apply, take a look at KittenWifHat on Solana. In my opinion, they have done everything right so far and other projects should take a leaf out of their book.\n\nI really hope that you will all find your project and don't give up hope.","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cpmkrk/why_youve_only_lost_money_with_memecoins_so_far/","author":"EfKayFFM","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-12T00:27:16Z","categories":["advice"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"What happens if Russia escalates the war?","post_content":"Are we planning for what happens if Russia ends up testing a NATO country?

Once humanity discovers a more efficient, effective way to perform tasks or solve problems, there\u2019s no turning back. This progression can be visualized as a series of expansive bubbles, each representing a technological era, enveloping the globe with new norms and possibilities.\n\n**The Nature of Technological Bubbles:** Imagine technology as a bubble that slowly engulfs the earth. This bubble represents not only the reach of technology but also its pervasive influence on every aspect of our lives\u2014from the way we communicate to how we travel and work. As this bubble expands, it reshapes societies, economies, and cultures in its ever-growing sphere.\n\nHowever, these technological bubbles are fragile. They expand and dominate until a newer, more efficient technology starts its own bubble. The new bubble then begins its expansion, often at the expense of the older one, which can burst or diminish as it\u2019s replaced by a newer, better form. This cycle is relentless and ongoing, reflecting a fundamental truth about human progress: we are always moving forward, searching for better solutions.\n\n**Examples of Technological Bubbles:**\n\n1. **The Transportation Bubble**: From horse-drawn carriages to automobiles and airplanes, each leap in transportation technology created a new bubble. The invention of the automobile, for instance, didn\u2019t just replace horse-drawn carriages; it redefined human mobility and reshaped cities, setting the stage for the next bubble\u2014electric and autonomous vehicles.\n2. **The Communication Bubble**: The telegraph bubble was vast, connecting continents faster than ever before. Yet, it burst when the telephone emerged, which in turn felt the pressure from the rise of the internet. Today, we\u2019re living in a digital communication bubble characterized by instant, global connectivity, a bubble that is itself being tested by emerging technologies like blockchain and quantum computing.\n\n**The Historical Bubble of Gold:** For thousands of years, gold has encapsulated the financial bubble, serving as the ultimate store of value and medium of exchange across civilizations. Its tangible nature, rarity, and the universality of its appeal made it the bedrock of monetary systems worldwide. However, even this seemingly unshakeable bubble is now being tested by digital innovation\u2014Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, often referred to as \u2018digital gold,\u2019 proposes a new form of asset bubble. Unlike gold, Bitcoin offers distinct advantages in the digital age: easier divisibility, portability, and what many advocates argue, a deflationary supply mechanism capped at 21 million coins. As Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance, not just among individual investors but also within institutional portfolios, it challenges the millennia-old gold bubble, suggesting that even the most enduring bubbles are not immune to the advances of technology.\n\n**Conclusion:** Technology is a one-way street\u2014there is no reverse gear in the march of progress. Each new technology that better serves our needs or opens new possibilities doesn\u2019t just add to our toolkit; it can completely reshape our world, making previous methods obsolete. Gold has been a monetary standard for centuries, but now it faces a challenge from Bitcoin, illustrating that even foundational technologies can be displaced.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic is crucial for anticipating future trends and preparing for the transformations they will inevitably bring. As we witness new technologies emerging to challenge established norms, we must consider how these will create their bubbles, potentially bursting those of older technologies.\n\n**Call to Action:** Think about the technological bubbles currently expanding around you. Which do you believe will have the most significant impact? And which ones do you think are on the verge of bursting? How do you view the challenge Bitcoin presents to traditional assets like gold?

Currently, it\u2019s just sitting in a drawer on a piece of paper.\nThis creates issues if the paper is lost or damaged. If someone finds it somehow, they can deduce as to what it is.\nSure, I can buy a metal seed plate but some of the same issues exist if it\u2019s lost or compromised in some way.\nI could use a safe deposit box facility but then I\u2019m trusting that it\u2019ll be secure there and I would need enough in my wallet to justify paying a fee to store it there.\n\nI want to create a way to store my seed phrase so I can access digitally in the cloud while still maintaining security and a level of self custody. \nI\u2019d create a list of 24 ordered questions that are intimately personal to me. In an excel/sheets workbook, I\u2019d have 24 tabs, each correlating to one word in my seed phrase.\nIn each of these tabs, I\u2019d have a list of the 2048 seed word possibilities. In a seperate column I\u2019d have a corresponding list of 2048 words related to each personal question. But only 1 of those answers would be correct, and that one would correlate to the correct seed word.\n\nBasically, \nColumn 1: 2047 incorrect word/phrases/dates that could be answers to my personal question, plus 1 that is actually the right answer.\nColumn 2: All 2048 seed word possibilities, the correct seed word lines up to the correct answer to my personal question.\n\nRepeated 24 times for each seed word.\n\nEven if someone found my answers workbook, they wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out the correct corresponding words without access to my personal questions. If they had access to my personal questions, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to guess them all as the questions themselves would be specific to me and only I would know the answer to them all.\n\nThis solution isn\u2019t perfect, ie I might forget the answers to my personal questions; things that are important and memorable to me now may not be so in 20 years. \nBut it means I can create copies that are equally secure regardless of how many copies I create. Unlike duplicating my seed phrase on multiple pieces of paper which could increase the risk of the phrase being compromised, depending on how it\u2019s stored.\nIt also means I can access my seed phrase digitally from anywhere. If I know the questions well enough, I\u2019d probably be able to deduce the answers myself without access to my personal questions anyway, which nobody else would be able to do.\n\nThe main concerns I have are:\n\n- could someone access the answers spreadsheet and somehow access a change log or reverse engineer the spreadsheet to figure out which is the correct answer? I\u2019d obviously combat this by splitting how I enter the answers in the column into groups, making it far harder to work out. But could it still be a probability?\n\n- Forgetting the answers to my questions. I could give certain answers to my friends or family, with no context or access to the answers spreadsheet. Or physically store the answers to the questions elsewhere, meaning someone would need to find both the answers and the answer workbook. If I see the physical answers have been compromised it gives me time to change them or secure/change my workbook.\n\n- A level of trust in the workbook provider is required. This one is probably minimal as I don\u2019t see Microsoft or Google discontinuing their service. But it means if I ever get locked out of my account etc I won\u2019t be able to access the file on the cloud. However it\u2019s easy enough to duplicate and create equally secure offline copies.\n\n\nIs there anything here that I have not considered? Is this even worth doing or is there a better way of going about securing my seed phrase?\n\nTL;DR - \nI want to get away from physically storing my seed phrase in a drawer. I want to create a solution whereby I use secret questions personal to me with the correct answers correlating to my seed phrase. These answers would be buried among 2047 other potential answers x24 in a digital workbook.\nThe only way to get the seed phrase would be to know each of the answers.","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1cp88iz/is_this_a_secure_way_to_digitally_manage_my_seed/","author":"Frosty-Cone","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-11T10:38:32Z","categories":["advice"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/CryptoCurrency"},{"post_title":"Finally made it","post_content":"","post_link":"www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1cp87qq/finally_made_it/","author":"Lightningpony","up_votes":184,"down_votes":0,"creation_date":"2024-05-11T10:37:10Z","categories":["general"],"media_url":null,"website_source":"r/Bitcoin"},{"post_title":"Question about address reuse","post_content":"I'm testing out sending money from cold wallets and noticed that when I sent a small amount of money from wallet A to wallet B, there are 2 outputs, 1 that sends a small sum to wallet A (my desired transaction) and output 2 which sends the remaining sum to the same wallet back (the originating wallet - public address).
