Alongside it, a major meme coin Book of Meme (BOME) has been surging upwards on the charts, and with this green-zone momentum, it\u2019s primed to beat most of the competition. However, the highest price-increase happened with KangaMoon (KANG) which has reached a new all-time high, as it saw a climb by 400%. We will go over the on-chart performance for all three of these cryptos to determine which one can climb the most in 2024. By the end, we will determine which out of these three is the best cryptocurrency to buy today. NEAR Protocol Price Up 327% YTD \u2013 Price to Reach Above $10 in 2024 NEAR Protocol (NEAR) experienced a year-to-date (YTD) climb of 327%, and could soon reach far more growth due to the ever-evolving ecosystem and partnerships. Just recently, Nayms partnered with the NEAR Foundation, to support the underwriting platform and enable a novel approach to smart contracts while bridging insurance. Moreover, the NEAR Protocol crypto could be positively affected by this partnership as in the past month alone it\u2019s up 31.1%. According to the NEAR Protocol price prediction it can end 2024 at a value of $10.08. Book of Meme Crypto up 1,924.2% in Two Months \u2013 Can It Surge Further? Book of Meme (BOME) is also displaying a major level of upwards momentum on the chart as it\u2019s up 1,924.2% in the past two months. The Book of Meme price is up 25% in a single month as-well, fueled by major bullishness. The RSI and MACD data of the Book of Meme crypto is now bullish, indicating further growth opportunities especially if it captures the attention of crypto whales. Based on the Book of Meme price prediction, the crypto can end Q4 of 2024 at $0.0159. KangaMoon (KANG) Positioned as a P2E Industry Leader KangaMoon (KANG) positions itself as a disruptive force within the meme coin space and the burgeoning Play-to-Earn (P2E) market, as seen from its recent 400% price upswing and rapidly-growing user-base that currently exceeds 20,000 people. Moreover, the presale has secured over $6.6 million in funding, with projections of it reaching $8 million by the end of the month fueled by strong trader demand, positioning it as a great cryptocurrency to buy. The KANG token transcends the limitations of purely speculative meme cousin through offering long-term utility. This is achieved through the strategic integration of the KANG token as the in-game currency for the upcoming P2E game. As a result, it fosters a solid economy and drives sustained demand for the token. The project introduces an innovative Social-Fi model as-well, which incentivizes social media engagement through pre-launch distribution of KANG tokens based on activity. This proactive approach has cultivated a thriving community that\u2019s actively engaged with the project\u2019s features and updates. Following the completion of Stage 5 of the presale, the team has launched a limited-time bonus round. The token spiked from $0.005 to $0.025, and at launch can surge by 100x based on analyst projections, making KANG the best cryptocurrency to buy today. Summary There has been a bullish re-awakening in the market as both NEAR Protocol and Book of Meme have displayed major bullishness. However, alongside them the KangaMoon token has seen a major upswing, and with its unique P2E elements and Social-Fi features it is set to dominate the charts in 2024 and beyond, making it a solid cryptocurrency to buy.

On that late Friday night (and in technical, computer geek UTC time, a party-perfect date of 4/20), Bitcoin turned the page to its fifth epoch. Fans cheered the end of its 28-month-long bear market and waved goodbye to the fourth epoch\u2019s 6.25 BTC block reward, welcoming a halved inflation rate of just 3.125 BTC per block. They hoped that the disinflationary shock might boost the price, and usher in a suite of upgrades to Bitcoin\u2019s functionality that would fund a wellspring for its security budget. Unfortunately, reality has failed to live up to their expectations. The price of bitcoin hasn\u2019t rallied since the halving, nor has the halving increased Bitcoin\u2019s security budget. A cornucopia of new activity was supposed to arise from a suite of Bitcoin-branded protocols at the halving. This was to be based on Ordinals, a software program that pretends to track satoshis, the smallest denomination of 1 BTC. Ordinals were supposed to empower active secondary markets for numismatics (collectible markets for unique satoshis or \u2018rare sats\u2019) and enable permanent data storage and on-chain software with inscriptions. Most importantly, they were designed to underpin Runes, a brand new fungible token protocol for trading ERC20-like tokens and meme coins on Bitcoin. Buy the rumor, sell the news All of those fantastic debuts have lifted Bitcoin\u2019s USD-denominated miner\u2019s revenue \u2014 the definitive measure of the blockchain\u2019s security budget against real-world adversaries \u2014 exactly nowhere. At block 840,000, Casey Rodarmor\u2019s highly anticipated Runes protocol launched to fanfare and prompted the largest-ever amount of money paid for a single block in Bitcoin\u2019s history: 74 BTC ($4.7 million). A single satoshi, the so-called \u2018epic sat\u2019 number 1,968,750,000,000,000, resold at auction for $2.1 million. It was a promising start. Just imagine, fans of Rodarmor thought: a single satoshi (commonly valued at 1/100 millionth of bitcoin\u2019s current price, $62,000) reselling for millions of dollars. However, there\u2019s no free lunch. Only a small amount of speculative new money actually entered the secondary markets for these collectible satoshis. As a result, Ordinals, Inscriptions, Rare Sats, and Runes traders could no longer afford to continually overpay miners for on-chain transaction fees. Runes failed to help Bitcoin\u2019s security budget Fees from this nascent community \u2014 heralded as the leading source of revenue for Bitcoin\u2019s security budget post-halving \u2014 have evaporated. Runes, like so many Bitcoin-branded projects for creating altcoins before it, failed to sustain its hype for even two days after the halving. In all, Bitcoin miners\u2019 revenue is down 75% since the halving. Worse, Bitcoin\u2019s security budget (approximately $30 million daily) is now lower than miners\u2019 median revenue this year (approximately $50 million daily). Read more: Prices of Bitcoin Runes dip two days after launch The chart of Bitcoin\u2019s security budget says it all. In the run-up to the halving, excitement swelled about a supposed new era for Bitcoin. Fans cheered the rising transaction fees, which spiked on the day of the halving. Traders spent millions to buy satoshis commonly valued at 1/100 millionth of 1 BTC and gladly overpaid miners with obscene transaction fees. Less than one month later, all of their bids have made no difference to Bitcoin\u2019s ongoing security budget. Runes failed its fans. As of today, neither Ordinals, Inscriptions, Numismatics, or any other protocol for trading satoshis have lifted Bitcoin\u2019s security budget above its prior average. Got a tip?

We know that AI can write code or parts of code and is very good at it if a developer divides the process into chunks. It helps save time and reduces a lot of the tedious work traditionally involved in code writing. But who owns the AI-generated code? This is the question that many are struggling to find an appropriate answer to. Where the question is valid, it doesn\u2019t have a simple, straight answer. But things are more complex than you might think. There are many elements involved that developers can\u2019t sleep over. For example, if the code contains business secrets, the risks are that they have been shared with OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, or any firm whose AI model you used. This is a likely situation. On an application, you are at work. For the most part, that application is your own effort. You wrote the majority of the code, created the business logic, and specified the user interface. However, you\u2019ve written a few modules using GPT-4, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude and integrated the resulting code into your application. Who is the owner of the AI-produced code? And does the program as a whole lose any ownership claims you may have made because of the inclusion of that code? Ownership considerations for complex products Professionals who specialize in data security and intellectual property point out that copyright and contract law are two different legal disciplines with distinct legal frameworks. One thing the legal system has been very clear about in the era of artificial intelligence is who owns the content created by AI: since it was not developed by a human, it cannot be protected by copyright. It isn\u2019t owned by the AI, the people who trained it, or the person who asked it to produce this information. An owner is not possible for that code. Does any of that code have a copyright? Or is every piece of software we write these days so thoroughly damaged that it may no longer be defended as a piece of intellectual property covered by copyright? In a recent decision, the curatorship of an AI-generated text collection resulted in the author being granted copyright over the collection. What are the implications for coders in a scenario where the next line might be created by AI and not protected, yet the previous line might have been written by a human and thus protected? It\u2019s a problem any attorney will agree with. This Pandora box has yet to be sorted out in courtrooms. Commercial firms can definitely not afford to lose the efficiency that they have gained with these AI models, so they might be ready to avoid any red flags raised by the legal teams. Meeting client requirements at lightning speed will remain a practice until a hefty lawsuit determines the ownership and copyright status of generative AI.","article_summary":"Developers who have been writing code for decades may soon find themselves in a tricky situation.

Aura Finance Price Set For A Breakout Over The Consolidation Channel AURAUSD Chart Analysis Source: GeckoTerminal.com The Aura Finance price has been on a sustained price retrace since mid-March, as it dropped below the $1.0 resistance level, data from GeckoTerminals shows. However, $0.6042 provided the needed support for the bulls to push the price over to the resistance of around $0.71. The Aura Finance price, since mid-April, has been trading within the $0.71 and $0.6141 ranges, forming a consolidation channel as the bulls aim for a sustained breakout above. AURA trades gracefully above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which confirms the general bullish potential. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trading to the north at 67, which shows that AURA is currently overbought. If the bullish stance continues, the RSI could rise above the 70-overbought region, indicating ongoing investor optimism. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also affirms bullish prospects, as the MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange), which represents a bullish crossover, poised to encourage the bulls to add more to their positions. Additionally, the green bars on the histogram are forming above the neutral line, indicating that AURA is gaining positive momentum and heading for a breakout over the consolidation channel. Aura Finance Price Prediction The Aura finance price Analysis according to GeckoTerminal shows that AURA is on bullish momentum, as the bulls aim to sustain its price movement above the consolidation channel, targeting $0.8380. Major indicators, including the MACD and RSI, show AURA is on a positive price trajectory, encouraging optimistic investors to buy more. The 50-day SMA is also moving towards the 200-day SMA, with signs of forming a golden cross, a bullish signal for AURA. However, if the bears take control of the price at this level, AURA could further retrace back to the support around $0.64. This acts as a cushion against downward pressure. Meanwhile, some investors are also buying into the new presale $5SCAPE, which has already secured over $5.9 million in funding as it races towards its $6.2 million target.

The country has mined nearly 474 bitcoins since 2021. This approach combines renewable energy with financial technology. El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin Mining Revolution The Bitcoin Office of El Salvador has noted significant developments. The state-owned Tecapa volcano plant now boasts 300 processors. These units tap into geothermal energy to mine bitcoins, confirm transactions, and secure the network. Mining using eco-friendly methods differs from traditional approaches, which rely on fossil fuels. This shift promises a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future for cryptocurrency. The geothermal plant, capable of 102 megawatts, dedicates 1.5 MW to mining BTC. In 2021, El Salvador took a historic step by adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender. The move drew both applause and scrutiny, particularly from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, some stakeholders predict that this trend will accelerate in the future. \u201cEvery nation-state will be mining Bitcoin at one point! Some start earlier, some later,\u201d Julian Liniger, Co-Founder & CEO of Relai, said. Economic Impact and Global Reactions Despite international critiques, the government has actively expanded its crypto infrastructure. It has increased its BTC holdings to $360 million. Mining operations have notably driven this growth, adding approximately $29 million recently. El Salvador Bitcoin Balance.

In a Wednesday blog post, KuCoin notified its users of the temporary suspension of P2P naira services and Fast Buy service via Naira card, stating that it is part of their ongoing efforts to enhance their services. The exchange\u2019s decision to halt P2P trading is likely an attempt to avoid running afoul of the Nigerian government, following the recent federal charges faced by another major exchange, Binance. Nigeria Intensifies Scrutiny of P2P Crypto Trading The Nigerian government, particularly the office of the Security Adviser, has intensified its scrutiny of P2P cryptocurrency trading. Fintechs and banks have been instructed to close bank accounts associated with trading and report such accounts to the authorities. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has also taken action by blocking thousands of accounts involved in crypto trading. KuCoin Temporary Pause on P2P Nigerian Naira (NGN) Services We regret to inform our Nigeria Users On the temporary pause of our P2P services We are eagerly looking forward to resuming the P2P Nigerian Naira (NGN) services and fast buy service via Naira cards in a fully\u2026 pic.twitter.com/v4YPSr8LIW \u2014 KuCoin Africa (@KuCoinAfrica) May 15, 2024 Emomotimi Agama, the Director-General of the SEC, blamed crypto P2P traders for the depreciation of the naira during a meeting on May 7, according to a report from TechCabal. He expressed concerns about the impact of P2P crypto trading on the exchange rate of the naira. However, despite these stringent measures, the naira continues to face challenges. On Monday, the naira fell to N1,520 per Dollar at the Foreign Exchange (FOREX) parallel market, a 3.4% decline from the N1,470 per Dollar traded on Friday. Binance Nigeria Conflict Resumes In a recent blog post, Binance CEO Richard Teng accused a Nigerian government official of pressuring crypto representatives to accept a secret agreement to settle Nigeria\u2019s claims against the exchange. The \u201csettlement\u201d was actually a $150 million bribe from \u201csomeone in the Nigerian government.\u201d \u201cCounsel reported back that he had been presented with a demand for a significant payment in cryptocurrency to be paid in secret within 48 hours to make these issues go away and that our decision was expected by the morning,\u201d Teng wrote. \u201cOur team grew increasingly concerned about their safety in Nigeria and immediately departed.\u201d However, Nigeria fired back at Binance\u2018s bribe accusation, claiming it\u2019s a distraction to shift focus away from the exchange\u2019s actions. Binance recently had to discontinue all services involving Nigerian local fiat currency, the Nigerian naira (NGN), after regulatory scrutiny. Earlier, the Nigerian government imposed a staggering $10 billion fine on Binance as part of a crackdown on the platform in an effort to stabilize the nation\u2019s local currency. Binance has faced increasing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Last year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed charges against Binance for allegedly operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange and evading federal laws. Similarly, the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Binance Holdings LTD and CZ for allegedly operating unregistered exchanges, broker exchanges, clearing houses, and the unregistered offer and sale of securities.

The speed of trades also makes it necessary to use trading bots, so strategies can be automated. Following the best traders was one of the main perks of platforms like eToro during previous crypto bull markets. Top traders specifically described their strategies and had great influence. In crypto, copy trading is more informal and has been automated by third parties. How Copy Trading is Made Easier on the Blockchain Additionally, since crypto wallets are transparent, addresses are on a watch list to track trading decisions. Traders can easily tap into public wallets or trading personalities, especially those with Ethereum DNS handles, to gather strategies for both existing pairs or newly launched tokens. Additionally, users can view or aggregate the notable activities of existing exchange bots through a blockchain explorer. The blockchain activities with lots of data also enable DEX and other services to offer easy-to-use copy trading products. Which are the Best Decentralized Copy Trading Bots? Decentralized bots must pick the optimal amount of data while connecting multiple exchanges and wallets. One tool took more than a year to go public. 🔥 Exciting news! 🔥 goodcryptoX is now public!

The Good Crypto has been renewed during the current bull market cycle, offering a new app-based approach. Tracking Whales and Finding Gem Coins Becomes Go-to DEX Strategy The mix of public whale wallets and a growing list of new assets means users can build their own copy-trading portfolio. This approach is only partially automated, and will still require personal research. The Dexscreener tool will give a long list of tokens, where those with good volumes and high locked liquidity are the best candidates. The DEX Screener app is a little different, don't panic! 🚨 You can go back to the old list layout by going to Menu > Screener Display Mode > List (Settings) > V1 Before you do that though, consider giving it a go for a day or two!

DEX Trading Draws In 100X Seekers DEX copy-trading has a riskier profile, mostly because its main target is potential 100X tokens. This allows projects to build their products entirely on-chain while automatically singling out the gems. The on-chain approach is even more powerful compared to signal-based trading apps. Logearn is one of the tools for 100X tokens, along with alerts when a good match is found.

Those addresses can be used with other sniping bots. Smart Money Vs Mass Sniping Wallets copy-trading tools can have different strategies. For traders on the Solana blockchain, the trend of meme tokens meant some traders did not even bother with pre-selection. Instead, they used automation to snipe all newly minted tokens with small purchases. This guy started accumulating $WIF back in December. He spent just a bit more than $2k. He made over $800k from this position already. Here's what I want to point out: \u2022 First purchase was made 14 days after token launch. \u2022 He trades other memecoins too. pic.twitter.com/XfgwKC7gTp \u2014 Leshka.eth ⛩ (@leshka_eth) March 23, 2024 Mass sniping is the opposite of doing some preliminary research, or of following the \u201csmart money\u201d. A whale wallet with thousands of tokens may make one good trade to offset the losses, but copying mass sniping holds additional risk. Solana DEX also offer more possibilities for sniping, due to lower fees and more agile asset creation. AI Assistance Boosts Copy Trades Analyzing data for thousands of tokens is a task best left to AI. For Solana DEX traders, AI tools also simplify the search for the best-performing whales. TradeWiz is among the preferred tools for Solana-based sniping.

On-chain tools for copy trading don\u2019t rely on social media influencers and their token preferences. While some traders make accurate calls on social media, there is also overwhelming hype. Using data, copy trading tools, and sniping bots helps avoid over-investing in unpredictable tokens.","article_summary":"Copy trading spreads across decentralized exchanges (DEX), trying to make the best of a highly dynamic market.

As the bull run of 2024 takes shape, understanding these dynamics could be the key to unlocking substantial gains. BlastUP Token Projected to Soar 1000% By Year\u2019s End BlastUP has been getting a lot of attention lately thanks to its high potential to become a major force in the crypto industry. This pioneering launchpad on Blast has already attracted nearly 15,000 active users. The ongoing presale of BlastUP is a huge success, with $6 million raised so far.

The BlastUP token, a cornerstone of the platform, unlocks access to tiered IDO launches, staking rewards, and exclusive loyalty benefits. >> Join BlastUP Now or This Rocket Will Take Off Without You! << Render (RNDR) Price Moves Towards Key Resistance Render's current price fluctuates between $9.63 and $11.81, heading towards a resistance near $12.80. If it passes this point, the next challenge lies at $14.98. It finds support at $8.44, with a stronger base at $6.26. Lately, RNDR traded lower than the 10-day average of $10.08 and the 100-day average of $10.73. With an RSI of 34.21 and Stochastic at 45.67, it shows no strong momentum. The MACD level at -0.13 suggests it might be preparing for an upward move. Prices have dropped by 4.27% in a week, yet they are up 10.16% over the past month and have made an impressive jump of 226.67% in the last six months. These changes point to a corrective phase with potential for impulsive growth if resistance levels are broken. Jito Crypto Sees Impressive Six-Month Surge Jito (JTO) price has seen a remarkable increase over six months, jumping by 2496%. The past month also showed strong growth with a 28.94% rise. Recently, the coin is trading between $3.47 and $4.50. While the one-week price change is a modest 0.26%, we're noticing stability in the short term. The coin is currently experiencing slight indecision\u2014indicated by the RSI around 51.39\u2014suggesting a balance between buyers and sellers. The MACD level near zero also points to consolidation. Jito's price moves are looking more corrective recently but remain close to the 10-day simple moving average of $3.88. With the nearest resistance at $4.99, if the momentum picks up, we might see a test of this level soon. Avalanche Price Movement: Between Correction and Growth Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a mix of price movements recently. In the past week, AVAX dropped by 7.72% and in the last month, it slipped by 12.53%. Despite these decreases, the six-month overview shows an impressive gain of 50.12%. Currently, the price fluctuates between $30.69 and $37.75. The RSI at 57.29 suggests that AVAX isn't overbought, while a high Stochastic reading of 89.16 may indicate potential for a price pullback. The MACD level at 0.027 is low, hinting that the coin might be in a mild uptrend or preparing for a move higher. The moves appear corrective as the price remains above both support levels and attempts to approach the nearest resistance at $42.35. If the momentum continues, we could see AVAX testing further highs near second resistance at $49.41. Blur Crypto: Is Recovery on the Horizon? Blur's price is currently trapped between $0.34 and $0.40, facing immediate hurdles at $0.44 and seeing support at $0.32. If sellers push harder, we could see a drop towards the $0.27 mark. However, the coin has lost decent ground recently, with a staggering 12.47% fall in the last week and an even more concerning 20.36% dip over the past month. The six-month view isn't much brighter, showing an 18.54% decrease. Blur's indicators suggest weakness, with the RSI leaning towards oversold conditions and a low Stochastic value, hinting the current trend is more of a correction than an impulsive move. The near flat MACD value indicates a lack of strong momentum in either direction for now. Conclusion Altcoins like RNDR, JTO, AVAX, and BLUR are set for growth, but their short-term potential may be limited compared to BlastUP. With a strong concept and its position within the Blast ecosystem, BlastUP stands out with the highest potential for significant increase. Investors looking for substantial returns might find BlastUP to be the most promising option during the bull run of 2024.

Mega Dice Token Presale Structure and DICE Tokenomics Mega Dice Token presale allows investors to purchase DICE tokens before their upcoming launch on the open market. Mega Dice\u2019s team has opted to structure the presale into \u201cstages,\u201d with each stage offering DICE tokens at a different price. To participate, investors must connect a wallet to Mega Dice Token\u2019s presale dashboard and swap SOL, ETH, or BNB for DICE. Once the presale ends, the purchased DICE tokens will be distributed directly to investors\u2019 connected wallets. When it comes to the project\u2019s tokenomics, it\u2019s worth noting that an allocation of 147 million DICE has been set aside for presale buyers \u2013 representing 35% of the total supply. A further 63 million DICE, accounting for 15% of the supply, will be deployed to provide liquidity once the token is listed on a DEX. DICE Token Powers Mega Dice\u2019s Rewards & Benefits System DICE is the native token of the Mega Dice online casino platform. While Mega Dice is already an established casino brand, the introduction of DICE is designed to take the experience to an augmented level. A key draw of DICE is the opportunity for token holders to earn daily rewards based on the casino\u2019s performance: by staking their DICE tokens, holders receive a portion of the casino\u2019s profits. The team has structured the reward scheme this way with the aim of allowing the community to benefit from the potential growth of Mega Dice\u2019s platform over the long term. As outlined in the project\u2019s whitepaper, DICE holders also gain access to exclusive rewards, bonuses, and limited-edition NFTs. In addition to this, DICE holders will also be able to use their tokens to get engaged with the casino platform. Lastly, an upcoming referral program will allow token holders to earn a 25% revenue share for any new players they bring on board. $2.25M Airdrop Campaign Drives Community Growth Adding to the interest around DICE is the $2.25 million airdrop campaign that the development team has planned for active casino players which details have been clearly outlined on the token presale page. This airdrop will be split across three seasons, each distributing $750,000 worth of DICE tokens.

In a public statement shared on May 14, the developer, known as Hoak, said it stole approximately $300,000 worth of user funds from the Solana-based cross-margin decentralized exchange (DEX). Hoak\u2019s confession followed a previous disclosure by Barrett_io, another pseudonymous core contributor, who raised concerns about the absence of funds. The post went unnoticed until a member of an unknown Discord group shed light on experiencing issues with fund withdrawals. Hoak Stole Funds from Cypher Redemption Contract According to Barrett, Hoak had stolen funds from the Cypher redemption contract over several months through 36 withdrawals. The funds were then sent to an intermediary wallet before being transferred to the Binance exchange. On-chain data compiled by Barrett reveals that an address associated with Hoak sent approximately $317,000 worth of Solana, Tether USDT, and USDC to Binance. cypher contributor Hoak (wallet: 7sKMs4mdqFzFgmcZhMnaZayCFqfDEimAf94A2KKXjrWW) has stolen funds from the cypher redemption contract. This happened over months via 36 withdraws (txs laid out in document). Summary of movement: Deployer wallet (ETR8\u2026) withdraws funds from\u2026 \u2014 cobra ©️ (@barrett_io) May 13, 2024 CoinStats data shows that at its peak on December 7, Hoak\u2019s wallet held around $68,365 worth of digital assets before the funds were sent to Binance. The wallet still held over $56,000 worth of digital assets on April 22, but within the next two days, over 99% of the assets were transferred. The incident deals another significant blow to Cypher Protocol, which has been striving to make a comeback after a previous hack in August 2023, when over $1 million worth of digital assets were stolen from the DEX. Hoak Says He Has Gambling Addiction Hoak, while acknowledging that he does not expect understanding for his actions, attributed his theft to a severe gambling addiction that spiraled out of control. \u201cI am also in no way, shape, or form attempting to victimise myself, but this is the culmination of what snowballed into a crippling gambling addiction and probably multiple other psychological factors that went by unchecked for too long.\u201d Critics of the cryptocurrency space have often drawn parallels between the industry and gambling due to its speculative nature. The comparison has been further emphasized by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, who likened the crypto ecosystem to \u201ccasinos in the Wild West,\u201d with stablecoins being compared to poker chips. A survey conducted by YouGov in 2023 revealed that individuals gambling at \u201charmful levels\u201d were nearly five times more likely to own cryptocurrencies than the general population, indicating a correlation between gambling addiction and participation in crypto trading. In another major incident, digital asset investment firm BlockTower Capital saw its main hedge fund \u201cpartially drained\u201d by fraudsters. Despite the recent hacks, the cryptocurrency industry experienced a major downturn in combined losses from hacks and scams in April. The month saw the lowest combined losses from crypto-related hacks and scams since 2021, with approximately $25.7 million lost to exploits, hacks, and scams. More specifically, only $25.7 million was lost in attacks throughout the month, marking the lowest amount since CertiK began tracking such data in 2021.
