This will allow Sonic to tap into a large number of users, liquidity, and other protocols. Connecting Fantom\u2019s Sonic With Ethereum The combination of these two cutting-edge technologies, Sonic Network and Sonic Bridge, will position Sonic in a class of its own. For the first time, an ecosystem will enjoy the full benefits of a layer-1 blockchain while offering native access to ETH. This enables the network to integrate the low cost, scalability, and speed of a layer-1 blockchain with the security of a layer-2 bridge, providing access to native ETH and other assets on Ethereum. Sonic technology has undergone intense development, culminating in the upgraded Opera chain, which now achieves 2,000 TPS of real-world traffic with single-second finality, significantly reducing storage needs and costs. As a next-generation platform for builders, Sonic will empower dApps and communities to flourish. Upgrading from $FTM to $S Upon the launch of the Sonic chain, the supply of $S will align with that of $FTM, facilitating a smooth transition process, as per the press release. Pending the outcome of the governance vote initiated today, users will have the opportunity to migrate their $FTM tokens to the new $S token at a 1:1 ratio during genesis. With the introduction of the Sonic chain, developers, applications, and users within the Fantom ecosystem will have ample opportunity to transition to this innovative platform. Initially, this migration process is expected to be bidirectional, allowing users to switch between $FTM and $S tokens. Given that $S will exclusively exist on Sonic and $FTM on Opera, a bridge is anticipated to facilitate bidirectional swaps. This approach ensures a seamless migration for current Opera network participants to embrace the Sonic experience However, once the transitional period ends, the migration will be one-way from $FTM to $S. This news can provide additional fuel to the Fantom (FTM) price which has already been on a strong surge over the past week. As of press time, the Fantom (FTM) price is trading 7.13% up at $0.8595 with a market cap of $2.4 billion. Over the last week, the Fantom price is up by nearly 20% amid the surge in the total value locked (TVL) on the protocol.

The players donated a portion of their in-game coins to Durov as a gesture of gratitude for the messaging app that hosts the crypto game. The donated haul has now surged in value to millions of dollars, and Durov has said he plans to hold onto the tokens until they experience a 100x increase. Over Notcoin 552,000 Players Donate to Durov In February, more than 552,000 players of Notcoin contributed a share of their in-game coins to Durov, resulting in him acquiring over 1.03 billion NOT tokens. This accounts for slightly over 1% of the total Notcoin supply on The Open Network (TON). As of this writing, the value of these tokens stands at approximately $7.3 million, though it was slightly lower at $6.8 million when Durov made the announcement. Durov, with an estimated fortune of $15.5 billion according to Forbes, is not in dire need of the cash and has no plans to sell the tokens. However, he has stated that if the value of the NOT token surges to $680 million, he will sell them to acquire additional servers for Telegram, further supporting the messaging app\u2019s infrastructure. 1,030,383,291.36 Notcoin ($6.8M USD) were sent as donation to Pavel Durov and Telegram. Thanks for everything you guys built.https://t.co/ZaBgB22yyg pic.twitter.com/8gmNjbBs3s \u2014 Notcoin Ø (@thenotcoin) May 17, 2024 Notcoin, which launched as this year\u2019s largest gaming token, debuted with a market capitalization of nearly $1.5 billion. As is often the case with new cryptocurrencies, the value of NOT has experienced volatility since its launch, plummeting by 50% to its current price slightly above $0.007, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the decline, NOT currently ranks as the 101st most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, amounting to $746 million. Impressively, it amassed trading volume worth over $1 billion within the first 24 hours of its launch. Having temporarily paused its coin-tapping gameplay in April to prepare for the token rollout, Notcoin is set to relaunch its crypto-earning game. The ultimate goal is for Notcoin to serve as a platform for additional games, aspiring to become the \u201cNetflix of social, viral games,\u201d as described by co-creator Sasha Plotvinov in an interview with Decrypt\u2019s GG in April. TON Space Will be Available Starting November Starting in November, TON Space, a self-custodial wallet, will be accessible to Telegram\u2019s global user base without requiring any wallet registration. This feature serves as an extension of the existing custodial version of the Telegram wallet, which has already amassed three million registered users. However, certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, are currently excluded from the self-custodial wallet due to the country\u2019s increased regulatory scrutiny and the geofencing of numerous crypto apps from the market. The launch of a new wallet comes as Telegram TON Blockchain has introduced a new feature that enables Telegram users to transfer Tether (USDT). More recently, the team overseeing The Open Network (TON) blockchain also completed its transition into a Swiss non-profit organization.
