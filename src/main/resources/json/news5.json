HBGL Hong Kong Limited (Huobi HK) was included among the applicants who withdrew their applications from the list of those seeking virtual asset trading platforms. However, it was removed from the list on Tuesday, as per the website of the Securities and Futures Commission. This action was taken after the company withdrew its initial application on February 23 and resubmitted it on February 26. However, the SFC did not specify why the firm withdrew its application. The SFC stated that crypto trading platforms must shut down their operations in Hong Kong by May 31 or within three months of further notification if they fail to submit their license applications by February 29. Hong Kong always welcomes crypto firms, but on the other hand, its neighbor, China has imposed a wide-ranging crackdown on crypto trading and mining. In June 2023, the city officially launched its crypto licensing regime for virtual asset trading platforms, enabling licensed exchanges to provide retail trading services. The SFC is formally examining the applications of twenty cryptocurrency exchange companies, including OKX, Bybit, Bullish, and Crypto.com, who have applied for such retail trading licenses Currently, Hong Kong has granted licenses to two platforms\u2014HashKey and OSL. The cryptocurrency platform HKVAEX, which was purportedly connected to Binance, declared last month that it was closing down following the withdrawal of its application for a license on March 28.

Over the past week, it has climbed by 19%, demonstrating strong momentum. Analysts anticipate further gains by the end of this month, with a projected target of $0.79.

Jito\u2019s surge can be attributed to an announcement by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which plans to introduce support for Jito perpetual futures on its platform.

KuCoin Token (KCS) The KuCoin Token started as an Ethereum-based token but now operates on its blockchain, facilitating transactions on the KuCoin exchange.

There will be three airdrops in total. The early success of gaming tokens such as Rollbit Coin ($RLB), which now has a market valuation of more than $200 million, has undoubtedly helped garner interest in the presale. But Mega Dice is bettering Rollbit in that it has its own story to tell as a successful business prior to the unveiling of its native token. With price stability and growth in mind, the team plans to execute strategic buybacks. The buybacks will be funded by a portion of the profits from the platform, contribution to price stability and appreciation. Alongside the buybacks, there is also a regular-schedule burn mechanism to reduce the total token supply, thereby increasing the token\u2019s scarcity and, therefore, value. The capped supply of the $DICE token guards against inflation so token owners have an extra layer of security underpinning the value of their investment.

Mega Dice\u2019s team has opted to structure the presale into \u201cstages,\u201d with each stage offering DICE tokens at a different price. To participate, investors must connect a wallet to Mega Dice Token\u2019s presale dashboard and swap SOL, ETH, or BNB for DICE. Once the presale ends, the purchased DICE tokens will be distributed directly to investors\u2019 connected wallets. When it comes to the project\u2019s tokenomics, it\u2019s worth noting that an allocation of 147 million DICE has been set aside for presale buyers \u2013 representing 35% of the total supply. A further 63 million DICE, accounting for 15% of the supply, will be deployed to provide liquidity once the token is listed on a DEX. DICE Token Powers Mega Dice\u2019s Rewards & Benefits System DICE is the native token of the Mega Dice online casino platform. While Mega Dice is already an established casino brand, the introduction of DICE is designed to take the experience to an augmented level.

The team has structured the reward scheme this way with the aim of allowing the community to benefit from the potential growth of Mega Dice\u2019s platform over the long term. As outlined in the project\u2019s whitepaper, DICE holders also gain access to exclusive rewards, bonuses, and limited-edition NFTs. In addition to this, DICE holders will also be able to use their tokens to get engaged with the casino platform. Lastly, an upcoming referral program will allow token holders to earn a 25% revenue share for any new players they bring on board. $2.25M Airdrop Campaign Drives Community Growth Adding to the interest around DICE is the $2.25 million airdrop campaign that the development team has planned for active casino players which details have been clearly outlined on the token presale page. This airdrop will be split across three seasons, each distributing $750,000 worth of DICE tokens. The first season kicks off the airdrop, rewarding players who stay active and hit a $5,000 wager volume within 21 days. Season 2 allows players to earn DICE by wagering any supported cryptocurrency between the presale and the token\u2019s official launch. Finally, Season 3 brings it full circle \u2013 players can accrue more DICE by wagering $5,000 within 21 days of the token going live. This airdrop campaign has driven Mega Dice\u2019s Telegram and Twitter communities to increase the number of followers: the Mega Dice Telegram channel now has 9,300 members, while the project\u2019s Twitter page has over 25,000 followers.

This price also means that SHIB has increased by 5.5% in the past week and by 15% in the past fortnight, with the meme coin also sitting on a 169% lift in a year. And its gain today comes as its price chart forms a bullish pennant pattern, meaning that its resistance and support levels are converging on each other. This could signal that the coin is very close to a big rally, something which the return of meme-stock trader Keith Gill has made likelier this week. pic.twitter.com/D1bHJd0C1G \u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 15, 2024 Shiba Inu Price Prediction as Analysts Spot Bull Flag Formation \u2013 Is a Rally Imminent? After rallying and dipping on each of the past two days, SHIB has rallied again in the past 24 hours, with its indicators looking very strong. Its relative strength index (purple) touched 70 earlier this morning, and despite a tiny dip, it has settled at around 65, indicating ongoing momentum and buying pressure. Source: TradingView More promisingly, SHIB\u2019s 30-day average (orange) has begun rising again, after having recently overtaken the 200-day average (blue). The latter move is often a sign of a breakout and given that SHIB has risen strongly today, such a breakout appears to have recently begun. The coin\u2019s resistance (red) and support (green) levels are point to such a possibility, with analysts recently taking to social media to suggest that SHIB is close to doing something special. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) in comparison to it's similar, previous breakout and run to All Time Highs (ATH), looks to be only in an \"intermission\" phase here in prepartion for a continuation to and above the current ATH at $0.000088598 which is currently over 282% away from here!

And the wider reason why the market has redoubled its interest in meme coins is that this week saw the return of GameStop instigator Keith Gill, better known as \u2018Roaring Kitty.\u2019 Gill\u2019s reappearance after a three-year absence has sparked expectations that we\u2019ll see a meme token season in the coming weeks, with traders already wading into meme coins in anticipation. Yet more broadly, SHIB continues to be one of the strongest meme coins in the market, given its fundamentals. It recently unveiled its upcoming privacy-focused layer-three network, while its layer-two network Shibarium has now processed well over 400 million transactions. Based on its strength, the Shiba Inu price should reach $0.000030 in the next couple of months. New Meme Tokens with Solid Fundamentals While SHIB may be one of the \u2018safest\u2019 bets within the meme token category, it certainly isn\u2019t the only mew coin with the potential to witness big gains in the coming weeks. In fact, newer tokens may be in a better position to outperform the market, with several new meme coins holding very successful presales at the moment. One of the best is WienerAI (WAI), a new Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has raised more than $1.8 million in its sale. WienerAI is more than a trading bot It's your AI trading companion! More details coming SOON! pic.twitter.com/HG5C0tE6Rk \u2014 WienerAI (@WienerDogAI) May 14, 2024 WienerAI is the native token of an innovative AI-based trading bot that will help investors trade more profitably. As a chatbot, it answer trading queries and offer recommendations on potential winners, so that users can stay ahead of the market. Yet it will also offer an atomic swap function, so that users can directly buy (or sell) any recommended coins through its platform. On top of this, it provides protection against front-running bots and traders, enabling investors to make trades quickly and efficiently. This gives it plenty of utility as a platform, while its native token, WAI, will have a fixed max supply of 69 billion tokens. Also bullish is the fact that holders will be able to stake the coin for a passive income, something that will incentivize long-term holding. Given that so many meme tokens depend entirely on hype and FOMO, the fact that WienerAI has genuine fundamentals puts it in a great position. Investors can join its sale at the official WienerAI website, where 1 WAI is selling for $0.000707. The sale will end once it sells 30% of WAI\u2019s overall supply, with the token set to list \u2013 and possibly rocket \u2013 soon afterwards.

The pause, which began on May 12, rendered several decentralized applications and bridges operating on it non-functional. Today, the network is back online after Conduit, a rollup infrastructure platform, resynchronized its nodes from the genesis block. Block indexing The team at Conduit clarified that although the Degen Chain was now operational, its block explorer is still undergoing indexing. So, the firm advised infrastructure providers to initiate indexing from a designated block to ensure smooth consistency in the process. Additionally, Conduit has taken measures to filter transactions from approximately five addresses, each harboring millions of failed transactions. It added: \u201cTo bring the network online as soon as possible, a few (<5) addresses were filtered during the replay process. These addresses have tens of millions of failed transactions and were stalling the replay process. Transactions from these addresses can be replayed, but on a delay that does not prevent the network from coming back online.\u201d The Degen Chain\u2019s block explorer shows that transaction indexing is in progress, with the rate at 95% as of press time. What caused Degen Chain outage? An earlier statement from Conduit explained that Degen Chain\u2019s issues began when it completed a custom configuration last Friday. According to the firm, this update caused two of its chains\u2014Degen and Proof of Play\u2019s Apex\u2014to stop \u201cposting batches for more than 24 hours. Upon resuming, the first batches triggered reorgs on both chains.\u201d However, Conduit promised to provide a more detailed post-mortem about the incidents, adding that the upgrade that caused the network\u2019s issues was validated on testnet before rolling out to mainnets. Meanwhile, the recent issues within Degen Chain have sparked increased attention on layer-3 blockchain networks, stirring division within the community. Particularly, skeptics such as Polygon CEO Marc Boiron have previously cautioned that these networks primarily serve to divert value from Ethereum onto the layer-2 platforms hosting these layer-3 solutions.

This report explores and analyzes Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem and the BTC price developments last month. Key takeaways: The Bitcoin price dropped following the fourth halving, reaching $57,000 before a quick rebound. This marks the sharpest decline since the FTX collapse. Despite the price drop, the Bitcoin network saw a surge in activity in April, with daily transactions reaching a record high of 927k on April 23. However, this increase was short-lived, and it dropped again by the end of the month. The surge in network activity led to record-high transaction fees in April, peaking at $25.8 million on April 24. This congestion might be linked to the Runes protocol launch. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds in April \u2013 the first monthly net outflows since trading began in January. While US ETFs faced outflows, Hong Kong launched its first three spot Bitcoin ETFs in April, potentially becoming a hub for Asian crypto investment. Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs gained traction, reaching a $2.3 billion valuation, despite Binance ending support due to potential network strain.

What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency created to function as a digital currency and means of payment that operates independently of any single individual, organization, or authority, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries in financial transactions. It is allocated to blockchain miners to validate transactions and can be purchased through various exchanges.Unveiled to the public in 2009 by an enigmatic developer or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become the most widely recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its success has spurred the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies. BTC Price Performance And Halving Charts While widely anticipated, Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving on April 20 followed the historical trend of short-term volatility. Bitcoin fell nearly 21% in April alone, dropping below $60,000 on April 19 as investors cashed out of a robust rally that had previously pushed prices above $72,500 (on April 8). Between April 30 and May 1, the Bitcoin price crashed below $57,000, its lowest level since late February. BTC/USD daily chart.

According to Glassnode data, while the first halving saw an immediate 11% gain, the subsequent two halving events saw price stagnation after two weeks.

Its Q1 2024 Signals Report suggests that Bitcoin is no longer \u201ccheap\u201d and undervalued. The analysts also see potential selling pressure from long-term holders and high overall profitability. According to VanEck, 94% of Bitcoin addresses remain in profit despite a slight decline of 4% over the month. Analysts at Bitfinex, on the other hand, are more positive and predict Bitcoin will consolidate for 1-2 months after the halving. The experts expect Bitcoin to remain the market leader and believe the economic situation is more stable than in past halvings. This could lead to sideways trading with swings of $10,000, with any price increase from the halving happening later. Looking for a Bitcoin Price Prediction?

Source: Artemis The 2024 halving block has become the most expensive block ever mined in Bitcoin\u2019s history, with users scrambling to inscribe rare assets via the Runes protocol. Users spent a whopping 37.7 Bitcoin (over $2.4 million) to secure a spot, according to data from Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space. Bitcoin users spent a record $2.4M in fees on the first halving block. Source: Mempool.space High fees on the Bitcoin halving block were fueled by a surge in demand for rare digital inscriptions and new token creation. This frenzy was driven by the launch of Casey Rodarmor\u2019s Runes protocol, which allows users to create tokens directly on the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the halving event. Runes offers an alternative to existing methods like the BRC-20 token standard \u2013 an Ordinals-based method for creating Bitcoin-based tokens. Both leverage Bitcoin\u2019s network, but Runes utilizes a more efficient Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model, unlike the \u201cinscription\u201d method of BRC-20s.

Other protocols like Ordinals (2,6%) and BRC-20 (0,7%) comprise a smaller portion of the network activity. Spot Bitcoin ETFs April 2024 was a whirlwind for spot Bitcoin ETFs. After a period of immense enthusiasm and record inflows in Q1 2024\u2014attracting $1.5 billion, $6 billion, and $4.6 billion in January, February, and March, respectively\u2014April saw a significant shift in sentiment, with outflows surpassing inflows for the first time since the Bitcoin ETFs launched in January. In April, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $343.5 million withdrawn from the funds, ending their three-month inflow streak. The initial inflows surge slowed significantly after peaking at $1.05 billion daily in mid-March. This coincided with a drop in Bitcoin\u2019s price, which fell 18% from its all-time high by the end of April. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC fund saw the most significant outflows at $2.5 billion. ARK Invest\u2019s ARKB and Valkyrie\u2019s BRRR also experienced minor outflows.BlackRock\u2019s IBIT initially attracted the most inflows in April ($1.5 billion), followed by Fidelity\u2019s FBTC and Bitwise\u2019s BITB. However, IBIT\u2019s impressive 71-day inflow streak ended on April 23 and has seen zero flows for five consecutive days since. The trend continued on April 30. ARKB was the only ETF with inflows ($3.6 million), while outflows from GBTC, FBTC and BITB resulted in a net outflow of $161.6 million for the day. Total spot Bitcoin ETF net inflow in USD.

After hitting a record daily volume of $9.9 billion on March 5 (coinciding with Bitcoin surpassing its previous cycle high), trading volume fell to $2.9 billion on April 30. BlackRock updated its Bitcoin ETF On April 5, BlackRock, a leading asset manager, updated their Bitcoin ETF prospectus, adding five new authorized participants: ABN AMRO Clearing, Citadel Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Securities. This move adds to the existing roster of authorized participants, including JPMorgan, Jane Street Capital, Macquarie Capital, and Virtu Americas. By incorporating these big Wall Street players, BlackRock could increase liquidity and attract more institutional interest in their Bitcoin ETFs. Hong Kong launched Asia\u2019s first Bitcoin ETFs While US spot Bitcoin ETFs have dominated headlines recently, April marked a significant shift. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) debuted three new spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 30, offering investors exposure to these leading cryptocurrency-based products. These include Bosera HashKey Bitcoin ETF (3008.HK), ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (3042.HK), and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF (3439.HK). This launch positions Hong Kong as a potential hub for Asian cryptocurrency investment.

DTCC announced it will not consider Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as collateral for loans or credit facilities. This change takes effect in late April, meaning these ETFs will have zero collateral value within the DTCC system. This decision could limit the attractiveness of Bitcoin ETFs for some institutional investors who rely on collateral for borrowing and managing risk. However, in an X post, cryptocurrency enthusiast K.O. Kryptowaluty clarified that this would only apply to inter-entity settlement within the line of credit system. The use of cryptocurrency ETFs for lending and as collateral in brokerage activities will continue unaffected, depending on the risk tolerance of individual brokers. The DTC system, or Depository Trust Company, is a key component of the financial infrastructure of the United States, acting as the central securities depository.

This move could be a major tipping point for institutional adoption of Bitcoin, bringing mainstream legitimacy and potentially driving broader investor interest. Australia\u2019s top exchange expected to approve Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 Australia\u2019s leading stock exchange, the ASX, is expected to list its first spot Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Bloomberg quoted sources familiar with the matter saying several companies have already filed applications for these ETFs. These include established players like VanEck and local Australian firms BetaShares and DigitalX. With a domestic market capitalization of $2.7 trillion as of March 2024, the ASX is a major player in Australian finance, and the arrival of Bitcoin ETFs could further diversify investment options on the platform. Bitcoin Mining Updates Bitcoin miners feel the pinch after the halving cut their earnings (from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC). According to data from Hashrate Index, the hash price fell below $45 per PH/s per day on May 2, despite a brief pop in revenue for miners post-halving amid the Runes frenzy transaction fee windfall (172 per PH/s on April 20).

Source: Hashrate Index According to crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, the hash price for miners dropped from nearly $0.12 in early April to $0.07 post-halving, following a $0.19 peak on halving day. Despite a high network hashrate maintaining pressure, hashprice has dropped, challenging miner profitability. The initial halving benefits through increased fees quickly dissipated, setting a new norm for lower daily revenues.

According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, there\u2019s no sign of miners dumping their Bitcoin capitulation \u2013 for now. But, if Bitcoin prices keep dropping, large miners may be forced to sell some Bitcoin liquidate to stay afloat. #Bitcoin miners' revenue has dropped to levels seen in early 2023 following the halving. Now they have two options: 1. Capitulation, or 2. Waiting for a rise in $BTC price.

Historically, periods following halving events have witnessed some miners exiting the market due to increased operational costs. The future of Bitcoin mining will likely depend on factors like Bitcoin price fluctuations and changes in electricity costs. There are also some new April updates related to Bitcoin mining: Block develops its own Bitcoin mining system Payments company Block, formerly known as Square, announced the development of a new Bitcoin mining system. This follows the completion of a 3-nanometer application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. Block plans to offer both standalone mining chips and complete mining systems. Waste heat from Bitcoin mining warms Finnish homes Finland is exploring utilizing waste heat from Bitcoin mining for residential heating. A new project by Hashlabs Mining integrates heat generation from specialized Bitcoin mining equipment (WhatsMiner M63S) with the existing district heating system. This system transfers heat from a central source (in this case, Bitcoin mining) through insulated pipes to multiple buildings. This initiative could provide a sustainable heating solution for Finnish households, particularly during cold winters. Norway tightens regulations for data centers, potentially impacting Bitcoin miners In April, Norway enacted new legislation requiring all data centers to formally register with the government. This registration process will involve disclosing ownership, leadership, and the types of digital services offered. Terje Aasland, Norway\u2019s Minister of Energy, stated that the government hopes this increased transparency will allow local authorities to make more informed decisions regarding data center operations, particularly their potential impact on Bitcoin mining activities. Bitcoin Ecosystem News April saw some important developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, showing how companies innovate on multiple fronts. MicroStrategy unveils a decentralized identity solution on Bitcoin MicroStrategy, known for its massive Bitcoin holdings, is venturing beyond simple investment. At their \u201cBitcoin For Corporations\u201d conference on May 1, the company announced \u201cMicroStrategy Orange,\u201d a decentralized identity solution built on the Bitcoin network. This system will leverage Ordinal inscriptions to store data directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This could revolutionize online identity management by offering a secure, tamper-proof and user-controlled alternative to traditional systems. Moreover, in April, MicroStrategy purchased $7.8 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 214,400 BTC. Ankr brings Bitcoin liquidity to Talus\u2019 AI-powered blockchain Starting May 1, Ankr, an infrastructure provider for decentralized blockchains, brought Bitcoin liquidity to Talus, a blockchain-focused on artificial intelligence (AI). This collaboration unlocks new possibilities for Talus\u2019 smart agents and AI assistants, allowing Talus users to leverage the security and value of Bitcoin while participating in DeFi activities on the Talus network. Coinbase integrates Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions Coinbase is now offering users more flexibility when sending Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency exchange integrated the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 technology that enables quicker and cheaper transactions compared to the traditional Bitcoin blockchain. To use the Lightning Network, the intended recipient sends an invoice consisting of a lengthy string of characters that Coinbase recognizes as the transfer amount. For this integration, Coinbase chose Lightspark, a provider of Lightning payments solutions, as its partner. Animoca Brands enters Bitcoin with Opal Foundation Hong Kong-based game software company Animoca Brands announced its foray into the Bitcoin industry on April 30.

Built on Taproot consensus, BEVM utilizes BTC for gas fees and boasts a current valuation of $200 million. BEVM also announced an investment from Bitmain, the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining servers. The exact amount of the investment was not disclosed. Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs The Bitcoin Ordinals market has reached a valuation of $2.3 billion at publication, even amid a broader market downturn. Ordinals are the first iteration of NFTs on Bitcoin. Ordinals live solely on the Bitcoin blockchain, unlike most of today\u2019s popular NFT collections that host their metadata on centralized servers, creating additional points of vulnerability. According to data from Dune Analytics, the network has over 66,3 million inscriptions to date and generated over $267 million in transaction fees. Bitcoin Ordinals boasted over 66 million inscriptions. Source: Dune Analytics It\u2019s no surprise that asset manager Franklin Templeton recognized Bitcoin Ordinals as a driving force behind the \u201crenaissance\u201d of activity on the Bitcoin network. Similarly, OKX Ventures, the investment arm of crypto exchange OKX, highlighted in its \u201c2024 Bitcoin Outlook\u201d report that Bitcoin Ordinals will play a \u201cpivotal role\u201d this year. However, the significant increase in NFT transactions has periodically congested the Bitcoin network since its inception, resulting in increased fees and slower processing times due to increased on-chain transaction validation. This circumstance may have influenced Binance\u2019s decision on April 4 to discontinue support for Bitcoin Ordinals. As a result, users are no longer allowed to buy, sell or deposit Bitcoin Ordinals on the Binance NFT marketplace. Bitcoin NFTs lead the market Among the 24 blockchain networks minting NFTs, Bitcoin emerged as the leader in April, with sales reaching $594 million.

The Rune Guardians (April 12 \u2013 April 19) is a collection of 10,000 PFP NFTs built on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project began with an airdrop of \u201cRune\u201d NFTs to members of over 20 Ordinals communities (Ordinals are a type of NFT on Bitcoin). Rune Mining Pups (April 20 \u2013 April 27) is a collection of 10,000 unique 2D pixel art NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project integrates functionalities associated with DAOs and offers potential benefits to holders. The collection\u2019s theme revolves around characters who discover digital assets. Looking ahead \u2013 Can the Bitcoin Halving Charts be Inversed? The April 2024 halving triggered the expected short-term volatility in the Bitcoin market. Despite a price drop of nearly 21%, the network experienced a surge in activity, with record-breaking daily transactions and a significant rise in fees. This activity spike was partly fueled by the launch of the Runes protocol. Looking ahead, several factors will shape Bitcoin\u2019s future trajectory: Institutional investment: The entry of major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and UBS into the spot Bitcoin ETF market signifies growing mainstream recognition and could drive broader investor interest. However, the DTCC\u2019s decision not to consider Bitcoin as collateral for loan purposes might limit its appeal for some institutional investors. Regulation: Regulatory developments like Norway\u2019s data center registration requirement could impact Bitcoin mining operations. How other countries approach Bitcoin regulations will be crucial in shaping its future adoption. Bitcoin DeFi: The emergence of the Runes protocol has revitalized the Bitcoin DApp ecosystem, showcasing the potential for novel use cases on the network. Continued innovation in this space could drive more activity to Layer 2 solutions. While the post-halving period witnessed a price correction, the Bitcoin market continues to buzz with innovation. The influx of institutional interest, ongoing advancements in mining technology and the burgeoning DeFi space all point toward a dynamic future for Bitcoin. How these factors will interplay and ultimately shape Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory remains to be seen. Looking for a Bitcoin Price Prediction?

The platform is constantly improving its range of automated trading tools to cater to the needs of its users. To that end, some of its most sought-after automated trading bots among users are Grid Trading for Spot and Futures, Rebalancing Bot, Auto-Invest, and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). Binance\u2019s Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot is a trading bot that automates a delta-neutral spot and futures arbitrage strategy. Additionally, it eliminates the need for users to manually execute two separate spot and perpetual futures trades. The Arbitrage Bot enables traders to generate funding fees by strategically opening perpetual futures positions and hedging them through opposite positions of equal size in the spot market. We believe in giving users more choices and we constantly review community feedback to understand what users want. Our Funding Rate Arbitrage Bot is a simple and effective tool to automate for users who already manually deploy arbitrage strategies. Its user-friendly interface means more users can try new strategies.

The Arbitrage Bot allows users to deploy two types of strategies: Positive Carry: The bot purchases assets on the spot market and concurrently sells the corresponding perpetual futures contract, with the goal of enabling the user to earn funding fees from a favorable funding rate. Reverse Carry: The bot strategically sells assets on the spot market while going long on perpetual contracts. The goal is for the user to benefit from collecting funding fees resulting from a negative funding rate.
