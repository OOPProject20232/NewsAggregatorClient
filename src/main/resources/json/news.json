The supply of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC expanded by nearly $10 billion combined over the past month. Is The Bull Market Driving Stablecoin Demand? Interestingly, increasing demand for stablecoins coincides with the current crypto bull market. Yet while stablecoin growth may be correlated with increasing cryptocurrency prices, industry experts believe demand for digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar are surging for other reasons. Austin Campbell, Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, told Cryptonews that while there is a correlation between stablecoins and the wider crypto market cap, it has been declining over time. “It appears that stablecoins are being used independently of crypto trading for payments,” said Campbell. He added that dollar-backed stablecoins are addressing a broader market segment compared to digital assets solely used for speculation. Stablecoin Use Cases For Payments On The Rise Their utility may be increasing as well, as a number of stablecoin payment use cases are coming to fruition. For example, David Uhryniak, Head of TRON Ecosystem Development, told Cryptonews that an app called Grab – known as the “Uber of Singapore” – recently began accepting USDT on TRON for payments. “TRC20-USDT holders can now pay for their rides or food delivery directly without converting to fiat currency,” said Uhryniak. “I expect a growing trend where more international e-commerce platforms will integrate with TRON to accept crypto transactions for everyday services.” According to Uhryniak, the TRON blockchain has become one of the preferred transport layers for popular stablecoins like USDT due to its low transaction fees and fast processing. “TRON has the highest circulating supply of USDT, at over $54.8 billion,” said Uhryniak. “Since early February of this year, USDT on TRON has been averaging over 2 million transactions daily.” Jelena Djuric, CEO and Co-Founder of digital asset issuance chain Noble, told Cryptonews that while stablecoins can be used for decentralized finance (DeFi), the platform has recently seen a surge in stablecoins for payments. “An example of this is being seen with Cypher Wallet, where users can load USDC from Noble and spend those dollars in stores wherever Mastercard is accepted,” said Djuric. Djuric added that she believes the most interesting stablecoin use cases currently focus on digital dollars. “Stablecoins are more convenient, efficient and scalable than the traditional financial rails,” she said. Djuric shared that Noble is currently handling $1 billion of volume per month of USDC transactions from the platform to other Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol chains. “We have grown USDC issuance more than most other native issuance chains for the past few months. This represents real adoption by users and Dapp chains that plug into Noble for liquidity,” said Djuric. Massimiliano Silenzi, CEO of research firm Cryptorefills Labs, told Cryptonews that recent findings from Cryptorefills show almost 80 percent of crypto-shoppers prefer to pay for goods and services with stablecoins versus other cryptocurrencies. Source: Cryptorefills While notable, Silenzi pointed out that due to transaction speeds and fees, only one-sixth of stablecoin payments take place on the Ethereum mainnet. “The majority of stablecoin payments are dispersed fairly evenly across alternative networks like Polygon, TRON, Solana, and Avalanche as well as Ethereum layer-2s like Optimism and Arbitrum,” said Silenzi. “As a result, when it comes to stablecoin payment networks that are quick, inexpensive, and scalable, there isn’t yet a clear winner.” Challenges May Hamper Stablecoin Adoption While it’s notable that stablecoin adoption may be increasing due to real-world payment use cases, regulations and other concerns may slow adoption. For instance, while stablecoin legislation may get passed this year in the U.S., Senator Elizabeth Warren recently criticized the proposed stablecoin bill. As Cryptonews previously reported, Warren argues that creating new regulatory frameworks for stablecoins could “amplify and entrench” risks they pose to the American banking sector. Moreover, David Pope, Commissioner of The Wyoming Stable Token Commission, told Cryptonews that tax rules around stablecoins remain a barrier to adoption as well. “The IRS views all crypto (including Stablecoins) as property (as opposed to cash),” said Pope. “This means whenever a US person or entity uses a stablecoin for anything, it has to be reported on their tax return (even though there is normally no gain or loss).” Pope believes that if stablecoins become commonly used, this will likely result in thousands of transactions needing to be documented. In addition to regulations, Djuric believes that non-crypto natives still struggle with Web3 concepts such as private keys, wallets, on-ramps, bridged versions of the same stablecoins, and more. “Noble is trying to solve all of these challenges, but it doesn’t happen overnight. Eventually, we should see chain and asset abstraction as secure but highly intuitive wallet interfaces,” she said. Indeed, these challenges may eventually lead to decreasing demand in stablecoins. For instance, Paxos’ most recent transparency report on PayPal USD noted the circulation of PYUSD in March totaled $188.5 million. This marks a 39% decrease in PayPal’s stablecoin compared to the previous month. Ways To Ensure Stablecoin Growth Moving Forward Challenges aside, Campbell believes that stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto space matures. “Stablecoins will probably outgrow DeFi and become a tool for real-world payments around the globe,” he said. Although adoption may be slow, education, along with retail demand for stablecoins, will ensure growth in the future. Notably, Tether is already taking steps to provide better stablecoin education. On April 10, Tether announced a partnership with Coins.ph – a popular digital asset exchange in the Philippines – to promote financial education for blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and stablecoins in the region. According to a Tether blog article, the educational initiatives being launched will target diverse segments of the Filipino population. This includes finance professionals like bankers and fintech companies, but also overseas Filipino workers seeking efficient remittance solutions. Pope also believes that as the general public moves through the learning curve, retail demand for stablecoins will increase. “This all suggests that stablecoins are slowly being adopted,” he said. “But can anyone buy their cup of morning coffee with them yet? Probably very few places accept a wallet transfer for that, but adoption does seem to be moving along.” The article Payment Use Cases Fuel Increasing Stablecoin Growth appeared first on Cryptonews.","category":["Altcoin News","News","digital payment","Stablecoin","stablecoin regulation"],"_type":"article"

ASIC Takes Action Against Collapsed Crypto Mining Companies ASIC launched civil proceedings against three crypto-mining firms, collectively known as NGS Companies. The proceedings also included the directors of these mining schemes: Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. We have commenced civil proceedings against #blockchain mining companies NGS Crypto, NGS Digital and NGS Group – and their directors – for allegedly providing financial services without a licence https://t.co/Hgwk81V5TD pic.twitter.com/XpKcXCBZxt — ASIC Media (@asicmedia) April 12, 2024 According to a Friday statement from ASIC, the court order also restrained Brett Mendham from traveling outside Australia. The regulator applied for these orders because it thinks investors in these crypto-mining schemes “are at risk of dissipation.” Crypto Mining Collapse Leaves Investors $41 Million in the Red The crypto mining firms collapsed into liquidation owing 450 investors more than USD $41 million. The companies allegedly targeted investors to establish self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted them into cryptocurrency. “ASIC alleges in the proceedings that the NGS Companies contravened section 911A of the Corporations Act by providing financial services without an Australian financial services license,” the release read. The regulator is now holding the companies accountable for illegally marketing investment products backed by crypto mining. ASIC Chair Joe Longo warned investors to consider risks before using their SMSF to invest in crypto-related investments like mining. “These proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinized by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers,” he said. Three Other Crypto Funds Thrust Into Liquidation in Australia In addition to NGS Companies, fellow crypto funds in Australia – DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund – have been forced into liquidation. Following a collapse of these crypto funds all within a week, the schemes potentially owe more than $150 million to investors. A Federal Court has appointed liquidators from KordaMentha to the three firms operated by Balanian that offered cryptocurrency investments. Additionally, liquidators are tasked to investigate and uncover more investors. Despite the allegations, the Balanian team has yet to respond.

Bittensor is a pioneering peer-to-peer (p2p) machine learning protocol that incentivizes participants to train machine learners across a global decentralized network of nodes. By spreading the computing load across multiple nodes, the Bittensor team hopes to create a collaborative and open-source AI training ecosystem that will rival the more centralized machine learning systems used by corporations like Google and IBM. Bittensor employs a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. PoI is an alternative to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model, where the nodes with the most computing power validate the most transactions and mine the most BTC. It also differs to the Proof-of-Stake model used by Ethereum, where the nodes that staked the most ETH validate the most transactions. Bittensor is currently the number one AI-related cryptocurrency with a market cap of nearly $4 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of just over $230k. Is it too late to buy AI token Bittensor (TAO)? Given the sudden price drop, it’s definitely not too late to buy TAO. TAO is frontrunning an AI token sector that will rise to prominence in the coming years once tech companies in jurisdictions across the world are confident about both crypto and AI regulation. In fact, some would argue the depreciation is welcome because it offers new buyers a chance to get in at a discount ahead of a potential future rally. However, Bittensor’s trading chart has followed a slightly different narrative to more mainstream cryptocurrencies over the last three months. While, broadly speaking, the price has gone up over the period examined, it has not moved in tandem with the rest of the market. According to the trading chart, the transition from February to March was more volatile for TAO than more leading cryptocurrencies. Having said that, the token has found strong support around $600 and is only trading 22% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of $757.60 set a month ago, March 8. Source: TradingView However, TAO’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 44 and falling, which indicates there could be further losses over the next 24 hours. Beyond AI Tokens Like TAO: Solana Meme Coins are Worth Watching If AI related tokens and protocols are undoubtedly the blockchain’s next technological leap, then Solana meme coins are its next cultural one. Bittensor is a good, solid cryptocurrency to invest in. Sure, it has its risks. As with all cryptocurrency investments, people should only invest what they’re prepared to lose, but Bittensor’s Proof-of-Intelligence concept and decentralized AI-training model are revolutionary USPs for any token. Meme coins are another promising sector and Solana meme coins are some of the buzziest right now. The network’s latest star is a 420-friendly sloth with big dreams. In just three weeks, traders have poured well over $10 million into an ICO for new Solana meme coin Slothana ($SLOTH) to try and recapture some of the early upside potential of recently profitable Solana funny tokens like Slerfs, DogWifHat and Bonk. Slothana isn’t lazy, although he certainly appears that way. High on ambition (and surreptitious toking), he’s eyeing the clock hands, waiting for 4:20 because from there, he hopes to get to $420 million. Word on the grapevine says Slothana is by the same team that launched Smog (SMOG), which rallied strongly after ending its presale and listing. Early investors hope to capture that explosive upside potential ahead of a Slothana listing. The clock is ticking and the $SLOTH team has not confirmed launch dates, so the presale window duration is an enigma. Got FOMO?

Robert Kiyosaki Claims Bitcoin ETFs Are For Institutions In an X article, Robert Kiyosaki shared his opinion that spot Bitcoin ETFs and other asset-backed “ETFs are best for most people and institutions.” Q: Will you buy the Bitcoin ETF? A: No. Just as I own gold and silver coin and mines and own apartment houses I do not own gold or silver ETFs or REITS, real estate ETFS. ETFs are best for most people and institutions. Personally I am an entrepreneur and prefer to stay as far… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 12, 2024 Having invested in a mix of assets like gold, silver, Bitcoin, and real estate, which he said are bargains today, Kiyosaki is sticking to his guns. He believes in making his own financial moves that align with his entrepreneurial spirit. However, the renowned author reiterated that investors should always choose what is best for them, noting that his stance against Bitcoin ETFs works best for him. If he makes a mistake, he has no one else to blame but himself, he noted. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ETFs market is at an all-time high, with tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) picking up pace. CoinShares data showed that cryptocurrency investment products, including Bitcoin ETFs, have recorded positive inflows of late. Total inflows were $646 million on April 8, and the year-to-date (YTD) inflow was $13.8B, the highest volume ever recorded. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, predicted an upward shift towards the tokenization of RWAs, such as bonds issued on blockchains, during a Chainalysis Links Conference held in New York. Robert Kiyosaki Endorses Cathie Woods BTC Price Prediction The remarks of Robert Kiyosaki, who has always been bullish on Bitcoin, came on the heels of the bullish price prediction made by Cathie Woods, the founder of Ark Invest asset management firm, who has been optimistic about the prospect of spot Bitcoin ETFs encouraging institutions to invest in Bitcoin. During the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22, Wood stated that the BTC price could soar to $2.3M per token. NEW: \"Cathie Wood guarantees #Bitcoin will hit $2.3M per #BTC.

Do I believe her? Yes, I do. Kathie Wood is very smart. I trust her opinion,” he wrote. “Could she be wrong? Yes, she could be. So what? The more important question is ‘What do you believe?’ What if Kathie is right? What if Kathie is wrong? And most importantly, ‘How many Bitcoin do you own?’ If Kathie is right, I will wish I bought more.” While Kiyosaki and Cathie Wood might disagree on ETFs, they both see immense potential in Bitcoin. Their optimism sparks discussions about the asset’s future trajectory and place in the investment space.

The article Gopax Reports Reduced Net Loss of $37 Million After Binance Acquisition appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_detailed_content":"Gopax, a prominent South Korean cryptocurrency exchange backed by Binance, disclosed a net loss of 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) for the fiscal year 2023, as reported in the year-end financial statement released by its parent company, Streamy. This figure is an improvement compared to the net loss of 90.6 billion won in 2022. Gopax’s revenue grew 97% year over year amid recovering market sentiment. GOPAX Reports Net Loss of $37 Million in 2023, Faces Challenges with GoFi-Linked Debt Gopax cash flow statement Site: Streamy On April 12, GOPAX released a financial statement that comprises its balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The balance sheets comprise the related statements of profit or loss, changes in equity, and cash flows for the years that ended. GOPAX reported a net loss of 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) for the fiscal year 2023. As of the end of the reporting period, the company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by KRW 66 billion, and total liabilities exceeded total assets by KRW 101 billion. Most of Gopax’s net losses stemmed from GoFi-linked debt, from deposits stuck in Genesis Global Capital. Genesis, which operated Gopax’s crypto custody service GoFi, suspended withdrawals in November 2022 due to a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement with FTX. According to the financial report, GoFi still owes users 63.7 billion won. Despite the continued net losses, Gopax exhibited favorable year-over-year performances in 2023. The exchange reported a significant increase in revenue, which surged by 97% to reach 3.1 billion won. Furthermore, the net operating loss decreased substantially, contracting 78% to approximately 17 billion won. The resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean cryptocurrency market propelled Gopax’s enhanced financial results in 2023. Notably, South Korea remained one of the most active crypto markets globally, with the South Korean won overtaking the U.S. dollar as the primary fiat trading pair for cryptocurrencies in November 2023, according to Bloomberg. Binance Grapples with Regulatory Delays and Financial Strain in Gopax Acquisition Binance acquired Gopax at the end of 2022 to address the latter’s liquidity challenges and expand Binance’s presence in the South Korean market. However, financial authorities have been delaying the acceptance of Gopax’s change of virtual asset business report for over a year, impeding Binance’s plans for market entry. Binance’s decision to acquire Gopax was driven by the latter’s inability to return funds to users following the FTX incident involving its virtual asset deposit service, ‘GoFi.’ Gopax Shareholders Source: Streamy Binance became the majority shareholder and took on the responsibility for GoFi’s debt, appointing Leon Singh Pung, the former head of Binance Asia Pacific, as CEO of Gopax. Despite submitting a report on the change in virtual asset business to the FIU, the decision regarding its acceptance has been consistently postponed. Gopax later replaced its CEO with former CEO Lee Jung-hoon and submitted another change report, but the FIU continued to delay its decision. In response to these challenges, Binance has initiated discussions to reduce its shares in Gopax to become the second-largest shareholder. This strategic move will alleviate Gopax’s financial burdens and regulatory compliance pressures. Binance CEO Richard Teng even traveled to Seoul in March to engage with local financial regulators to address these concerns. As of the latest financial report, Binance remains the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. However, a Binance spokesperson has stated that there are no updates regarding any changes to Binance’s ownership stake in Gopax.

GM Tether's tokenisation platform will soon be available to everyone. A masterpiece. Fully non custodial. Multi chain. Multi asset type. Super customizable. +T — Paolo Ardoino 🍐 (@paoloardoino) April 14, 2024 Features of the platform The feature that attracts many users the most is that it is categorized as non-custodial platform so that they possess all their tokens and do not depend on Tether as their storage provider. Such a feature not only serves to increase the security but also to give the users an absolute ownership and control of everything digital they own in the blockchain. Another thing of interest is its capability to connect with many chains which further increases its power and gives users the opportunity to pass information on other currencies or blockchains. Much to this, the platform provides a wide customization and supports users to convert it to their special needs from investment, operational and compliance aspects. An ecosystem constitutes a digital asset. The community’s ability to leverage Tether’s platform, in contrast, is expected to importantly define the platform’s service range and thus, probably its entirety. Besides the dissemination of the sophisticated tokenization functionality, Tether also has a vast appeal to crypto adopters and investors; and is also giving a chance to the non-crypto businesses and enterprises to come acquainted with blockchain technology. This decision will change blockchain technology usage in general, will increase the security of the digital transactions, and will result in higher technologies in crypto assets management. The most impressive achievement of the cryptocurrency market is the straightforward transition to an open and accessible tokenization platform with Tether deploying the project, which paves the way for more innovative options and services that might be the foundation for brand new applications and cases.","category":["Industry News","tether"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e181","guid":"https://cryptonews.com/?p=197689","article_link":"https://cryptonews.com/news/is-uniswap-going-to-zero-uni-price-drops-20-after-sec-scrutiny-as-this-other-coin-prepares-for-exchange-launch.htm","website_source":"cryptonews","article_title":"Is Uniswap Going to Zero?

While these losses suggest more of a dip than a crash, it’s still the heaviest overnight depreciation by any of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap except Toncoin (TON). Telegram’s cryptocurrency spin-off TON shed 3.6% overnight and currently trades for $7.13. That’s heavy when juxtaposed with the rest of the leaders’ performances today, but TON is still some 37.5% higher than it was this time last week, thanks to some singular rallies recently. Source: TradingView According to UNI’s chart, token holders enjoyed remarkably steep and intense growth spurts on Friday, 23 February and Wednesday, 06 March, amidst a sustained turn-of-the-month fortnight-long rally across the market. For UNI holders, this peaked when their token hit $16 and it has been in steady decline since, with the steepest losses posted in the last 48 hours. According to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings, a sell-off, which gained momentum on the eighth peaked yesterday when the RSI bottomed down to about 20.

Uniswap? DEXs? DeFi? Learn and earn with 99Bitcoins! Uniswap is DeFi’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX). This means users can buy and sell a large inventory of cryptocurrencies as with centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, but they have to self-custody their crypto. Some see this as a barrier to entry. While it’s not difficult to select a wallet and begin trading crypto on DEXs, it’s not as streamlined as whipping out a MasterCard, paying for it, and letting the exchange do the custodial work. Many lost faith in letting exchanges custody their crypto after the recession in 2021/2022, when crypto companies with liquidity troubles routinely paused withdrawals to head off bank runs. It culminated with the collapse of FTX, an exchange that had been sending billions of customer funds to its sister company, Alameda Research. Since these revelations, there has been growing attraction around DeFi and self-custodying crypto through decentralized wallets that give them control over their own private keys, like Uniswap’s. If anything, the events of 2021 were a reminder to the industry on the importance of educating the public. The most important lesson people learned after FTX was the importance decentralization: the founding ethos of crypto. However, it can be overwhelming to crypto novices to know where to educate themselves. Luckily, there is a new crypto presale for an established crypto education project that hopes to revolutionize learning with its learn-to-earn model. 99Bitcoins is a heritage platform that brings with it a long-established community of 700,000 YouTube subscribers alongside 2 million registered users for its crypto courses. Through its revolutionary Learn-to-Earn model, 99Bitcoins uses a blend of gamification and a leaderboard reward system to make users feel like their learning is bearing tangible (spendable) benefits. In other words: users earn crypto for learning about crypto. Interested? Visit the secure presale website today to Buy 99Bitcoins. The article Is Uniswap Going to Zero?

Where A.I. election aid tasks such as unexpressed expressions that a person is depressed or suicidal, and these expressions are the core reasons the elections came to light were the main priorities. It is vital to reach out to more people, educating them about voting day and discussing the election system and results because we do this through straightforward inquiries. Efficient information retrieval Assume that Election Mitra is the research body for the documentary. AI allows us to hack data systems and filter data by authorizing us to review the source database we managed to collect. Now, the actual method of this process is that it renders this data functionally unintelligible for anyone attempting to decrypt it. The pamphlets depict printed material of RULs with textbooks and images, which have proven to be an insightful glimpse into the trends in this fashion world market. We propose employing AI systems like self-governing and fact-checking services to ensure that Election Mitra provides proper and relevant solutions to the voters quickly, specifically during the election season. Electors won’t read such debates that are election-oriented when they can sooner reach articles in an easy form, and that accentuates. The array of problems that of the purpose of “Election Mitra” is not limited to local bodies; however, it also provides its members with the acts drafted by governmental bodies and the speeches of different civil organizations for the construction of a fair society by skill the gap between electorate and politician this will be done through the adoption of different clauses. He will put it that way: the Atrocity Acts for SC/ST, people’s Representation, and Excise Acts will be among the few debated in this session. As training progresses through layers of simple to complex, the learner is provided with a guided model police agency even where issues span different fields and sciences, including problem areas like data disruptions and disciplines, among other fields. Mitra, the impartial universal housing location that deals with many other issues related to the last elections, will surely be your new cool place that will push your information to those you don’t know. User-friendly interface On the other hand, personalized software is developed to provide the voters with a simple and easy operation, which is fulfilled by the offering of an interface that gives a chance to people with different knowledge levels to have a role in the whole thing by way of creating the interface being friendly to the users which is understandable and easy to use will be done by creating the platform of interaction which is friendly to the people with access to various skills Thus, the function of navigating will be supported mainly by screens in devices rather than burdening the user’s mind when she is using desktop and her pocket device. Visuals that do not have a tone that is too ‘corporate-like’ and are a ‘simple’ platform meet this one criterion: the learning process should be effortless. With a Live active learning model being discussed, the few crucial parts, such as the sentiment analysis piece of the application, are having the intelligent reply with the sentence that making the application does not have to deal with boring content for the users. The period called Election Mitra is solely focused on making a section of the future process that will eventually be accessible to many people so that they have just mobile phones to know the necessary election data. Like bookshops, these online facilities help restrict the reach of reading material to different book genres for some people and just position their readers’ large appetites with the different makes available. Thus, the connection between peace deputies and individuals grows, thus humanizing the police, electoral bodies, and political parties. With this technology, the people can now understand the elections’ rules and, simultaneously, give the officials a chance to conduct the elections on time. In Weinstock, Weiber, and Vindel ‘s words, electoral management is an instrument of transformation of democracy. Consequently, it cannot take place due to the operational objectives of a polity as it is citizens-oriented, transparent, or accountable. Future prospects A major part of what charges the mobile app called the Election Mitra is the awesome public openness towards using the app. Also, the more the app picks up and gets a gripping following, the more it boasts the app development company to add more features to the liking of political parties. On the other hand, the midterm electoral report will include newswire reports and presentations about the election process, election procedures, and the admission of polling booth locations. Furthermore, e-modules will be woven into the talk to improve the understanding process, and the concept idea will be presented apart from the accountability. On top of this, incorporating the element of the “human” facet to the “will of the Election Mitra” is tasked with humanizing it. Therefore, the allegiance of Kadapa voters to its essence and processes will be cultivated. Being a media for the entire electoral conduct of Kadapa, the radio is thus expected to aid in various aspects of the future electoral conduct. At the same time, it may be applied in such a way as to overshadow most of the known conduct of elections. Subsequently, the model of a new Police station serving the district of Kadapa has been built on the principle of new concept innovation, the process of which will be vaulted and supported by the policy-makers who are willing to step another stage forward in the bottled ballot, meaning that an election will be opened in Maavra, another place in which the whole process will start. The wide range of issues presented as arguments may be varied in information; still, there is a spreading of views during this point that needs to be considered. This element is the key factor that generates a source of sustaining and encouraging all the stakeholders, empowering and activating them to make it possible and maintain democracy. The infrastructure will be user-oriented and unified – so the users can grasp the idea of compactly campaigning as a whole. This kind of innovation provides us with a space arch, which is the goal of society, and current politics are factors that will affect the further advancement of the platform. Upshot: The tactic I consider is the end-user’s convenience, and you should ensure the interface is used comfortably and conveniently. Whatever the plan, be it a solvable problem, it will never remain with holes or loopholes. Whatever the loopholes are, all the good ideas, if not all, will be used to develop a plan for implementing good strategies and removing the problems from the community.

After a strong finish to 2023/start to 2024 that saw many major altcoins posting 2-3x or more gains, as well as Bitcoin recovering to new record highs, momentum has stalled, and profit-taking has taken over. Jitters about a Bitcoin halving related turbulence, fading Fed rate cut bets and geopolitics have added fresh reasons to derisk. Where Next For Cryptocurrency Prices? It remains far too early to say definitively that the latest drop in cryptocurrency prices is over. After all, there remains plenty of room left for escalation between Iran and Israel. The altcoin pullback presents a great opportunity for investors to get in at bargain prices versus a few weeks ago. But anyone jumping into the market now should be ready for significant two-way volatility. Or, if they fancy buying a crypto that carries a much lower risk of near-term 15% intra-day moves, there’s Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin has dropped 5% in 24 hours on risk off flows. But trading in the $67,000s, BTC is only down 8% from the record highs it hit near $74,000 last month. Moreover, it remains locked well within recent ranges. That could reflect the fact that many view Bitcoin to actually be a safe haven asset, much like gold. And its general resilience in recent weeks could reflect a reluctance to sell ahead of the halving/amid ETF optimism. While a article-halving “sell-the-fact” reaction could see Bitcoin dip back towards the $60,000s, its outlook remains strong. Prior halvings have typically been followed by huge price run-ups to fresh record levels within a few months. Big US deficit spending and global central bank easing suggests that macro will remain a tailwind. That’s even if the Fed is comparatively slow to begin cutting rates, amid robust US data. And finally, institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has added a new, long-term source of buy pressure to the market. $100,000 Bitcoin for later this year remains very much on the cards.

NASA and SpaceX astronauts are utilizing the metaverse to undergo training, for life on a space station known as “Gateway,” which is currently in the works. This space station is envisioned as a cutting-edge science laboratory solar-powered spacecraft and a home away from home for astronauts from around the world as detailed in a blog article by NASA. How Metaverse Is Changing The Cosmo Game In the past astronauts typically trained for missions using computer-based simulators. However with the advent of virtual reality headsets and advanced spatial computing technologies astronauts now have the opportunity to acquire the skills to operate and thrive in an immersive 3D environment. The initial inhabitants of space will be the team for managing Gateway, which is being established as a crucial site for the Artemis program. The goal of this U.S.-led endeavor is to construct a manned outpost on the Moon. This will be part of humanity’s mission to send a human to Mars. Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions According to NASA Gateway plays a role in the Artemis missions. Will serve as a versatile outpost orbiting the Moon. It will offer support for surface expeditions serve as a hub for scientific endeavors and acts as a launching point for further exploration, into deep space. As per NASA, the astronauts assigned to the Gateway project will encounter the mission of becoming the crew of an orbital space station in deep space situated at a distance of around 386,243 kilometers from Earth. In contrast, astronauts aboard the International Space Station typically work at a distance of 400 kilometers, from Earth. NASA Planning to Utilize Blockchain Technology NASA is teaming up with Lonestar and the Isle of Man to use blockchain technology for verifying and securing data storage on the moon during the upcoming Artemis missions. Blockchain will be used to provide irrefutable proof of human landing on the moon during NASA’s Artemis 3 mission in 2025. Before that, Artemis 2 will launch in November 2024 with a crewed mission to orbit the moon and return to Earth. As one of the scientific missions during the Artemis voyages, Lonestar and the Isle of Man will develop lunar storage systems that rely on solar power and require no additional infrastructure. According to Roosen, the head of innovation at Digital Isle of Man, the island’s government-funded agency that supports its tech sector, “people often tell NASA: ‘You made up the moon missions,’ and proving that they’re actually there is surprisingly difficult.” How Blockchain Is Useful To NASA? Blockchain technology’s immutability is reliable for recording and verifying future lunar missions. This would provide real-time check-in mechanisms for lunar exploration and indisputable evidence of human presence on the moon’s surface, helping NASA dispel any conspiracy theories surrounding lunar landings. This project marks a significant milestone in the evolving relationship between blockchain technology and space exploration, as blockchain-verified data storage solutions could authenticate historical space achievements and future lunar activities as NASA’s Artemis program progresses. Summary NASA and SpaceX astronauts are training in the metaverse for life on a space station called “Gateway”. Gateway is being built as a crucial site for the Artemis program, which aims to construct a manned outpost on the Moon as part of humanity’s mission to send a human to Mars. NASA, Lonestar, and Isle of Man will use blockchain to secure data storage on the moon during Artemis missions.

This concern was outlined in a paper presented by Cardell during an Antitrust Law Spring Meeting in Washington on April 11. UK Competition and Markets Authority Concerned over Potential Market Exploitation Cardell, head of the regulatory body, has expressed concern that Big Tech investments in the artificial intelligence sector could stifle competition. “The essential challenge we face is how to harness this immensely exciting technology for the benefit of all, while safeguarding against potential exploitation of market power and unintended consequences. We’re committed to applying the principles we have developed, and to using all legal powers at our disposal – now and in the future – to ensure that this transformational and structurally critical technology delivers on its promise,” Cardell explained. According to the CMA boss, there’s an “interconnected web of over 90 partnerships and strategic investments involving the same firms: Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia (the leading supplier of AI accelerator chips).” We’ve outlined our growing concerns in the #AI #foundationmodels market, including 3 key interlinked risks to fair, open and effective competition. Read more about these, as well as our plans for further action, here: https://t.co/pP2larduqN pic.twitter.com/YeShd28aUH — Competition & Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) April 11, 2024 The concern is regarding the impact of these investments on customer choice and healthy competition within the rapidly growing AI sector. The CMA chief outlines three specific dangers: Control over inputs: Big Tech could gain control of essential AI inputs like data and specialized chips. Limiting choice: Companies could leverage existing market power to limit user options for AI services. Anti-competitive alliances: These tech giants could form partnerships explicitly to concentrate market power and hinder innovation. Big Tech Firms Invest Massively In Artificial Intelligence Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have invested billions in AI development, hiring top talent and building products for vast user bases. Microsoft’s backing of OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT and leading model GPT-4) is a prime example. These investments, while fueling progress, also solidify their positions as gatekeepers within the industry. The CMA recognizes the potential benefits of AI and the expertise these corporations possess. However, Cardell worries that smaller companies could be squeezed out if the current trend continues. EU Launches Probe into Tech Giants Over Digital Markets Act Violations The European Commission began an extensive investigation targeted at Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta over non-compliance practices under the new Digital Markets Act (DMA).#newshttps://t.co/qECt1urPHv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2024 The CMA’s stance echoes growing regulatory sentiment in the US and Europe as authorities grapple with Big Tech’s increasingly dominant role.

The article Nikolaj Rosenthal, CEO of Myrmidon, on ETH, Staking-as-a-Service, Non-Custodial Staking, and the Ethereum ETF | Ep. 325 appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_detailed_content":"Nikolaj Rosenthal, former ice hockey star and CEO of non-custodial staking provider Myrmidon, sat down for another exclusive interview with Cryptonews Podcast host Matt Zahab. He talked about his gradual and intentional switch from a professional sports player to a crypto entrepreneur, accepting Bitcoin as salary seven years ago, establishing a staking-as-a-service, and chains coming to Myrmidon soon. Rosenthal told us why ETFs are useful but go against the basic crypto ethos, and how Myrmidon ensures true coin ownership. Lastly, he discussed the pros and cons of the four staking types: which one is the most difficult but most beneficial earning-wise and which one is the least. In this interview, Rosenthal discussed: being the first athlete to accept BTC as salary in 2017; Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider; what’s going on with Ethereum; the implications of Ethereum ETF; solo-home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. You can watch what Rosenthal told Matt in the video above or read it below. From Hokey Player to Crypto Player There’s a pattern in the world of sports, Rosenthal said. Players retire and then feel like they’ve lost their identity. They struggle to live outside the sports world. Rosenthal didn’t want this happening to him, so he started spreading out career-wise early on. Being a pro hockey player in the US or Canada pays very well. In Europe, too, a player can “make a pretty good living.” But making money article-retirement is difficult. Rosenthal returned from the US to Europe, well aware that his career would come to its inevitable end. Therefore, he went to study and earn his degrees from the Copenhagen Business School. Also, in 2016, he fell “deep down the rabbit hole” of crypto through Danish Bitcoin entrepreneur Niklas Nikolajsen, who founded Bitcoin Suisse AG in 2013. This path ultimately led to Rosenthal becoming the first athlete to accept Bitcoin as a salary in 2017. Many would certainly think this a very strange and/or bad financial decision at the time. Bitcoin and the world of crypto were very different seven years ago, and they were perceived differently in the mainstream. But it turned out to be an excellent decision, and there are multiple athletes today accepting their salary in crypto. And “I definitely orange-pilled a couple of boys, that’s for sure,” Rosenthal said. He noted how relative the term ‘early’ is. In 2016 he used to think of those who had gotten into the space in 2015 or 2013 as being early. But now that he looks back, he was early too. Anybody who gets in today will likely be ‘early’ for somebody entering the space in 2030, let’s say. No Competitor for Ethereum Yet Rosenthal eventually went on to co-found Myrmidon in 2022. It’s a non-custodial staking provider primarily focused on Ethereum. The CEO commented that “today, Ethereum is still the biggest L1 chain out there.” There are some layer-1 blockchains competing with it, including Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano. But “the bottom line is that Ethereum is still the one to beat, in my view,” Rosenthal remarked. Since the last time Rosenthal was a guest at Cryptonews Podcast back in 2021, Ethereum has undergone a number of major upgrades. And “everything went smoothly,” he said. Congratulations to the entire #Ethereum community on a succesful Dencun upgrade on epoch 269,568. Here are some of the most important things you need to know about the upgrade : pic.twitter.com/zQbYLS0ELg — Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) March 14, 2024 An issue, Rosenthal argued, is that some people may not understand what an update is supposed to do, expecting it to do something else – for example, lower the fees, which are a major pain point for Ethereum. A negative narrative is then created around the chain when an upgrade doesn’t do what it wasn’t supposed to do in the first place. Though he doesn’t fully understand why there has been so much negativity recently directed at Ethereum, Rosenthal remarked that it does follow historical patterns of “ETH getting hammered, Bitcoin taking off.” The latter is up primarily because of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval is the US. And Ethereum ETFs are expected to follow. And while personally he doesn’t “really care about the ETF,” the entrepreneur finds it beneficial for adoption. That said, “long-term, ETH ETF or not, it doesn’t really matter for the adoption of ETH because I can’t really see a competitor to ETH as it is right now,” Rosenthal opined. Case Against ETF and For True Ownership Going deeper into the ETF argument, Rosenthal argued that “it’s a great product for the average person out there.” It’s an easy way to enter the space and get exposure to the asset class. But there is a big ‘but’. It’s counter-crypto. Crypto, Rosenthal says, was invented for people to custody their own assets and always maintain full control. The Bitcoin ETF is, by default, not a product that allows this. People make different choices when managing their assets. And it likely can’t be expected that everybody will self-custody. However, “for me, the underlying asset and owning the underlying asset is really what matters,” Rosenthal said. This is why the Myrmidon team made the non-custodial solution, Ethereum Staking Dashboard, enabling people to easily stake their ETH without losing control over it. The stakers don’t give up their keys, and they also earn yield. There is a saying in #crypto – \"Not your keys, not your coins\" That's why we're all about native non-custodial #Ethereum staking So why pick us? 1⃣ You have 100% validator control 2⃣ 0% protocol rewards fee 3⃣ 100% native staking Get started todayhttps://t.co/NaG7pWH6Og pic.twitter.com/JDHoHzUJm8 — Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) February 14, 2024 Notably, Rosenthal explained, Ethereum staking is a bit different. Most proof-of-stake blockchains use delegation: for example, you delegate ADA or SOL to the stake provider. However, if you want to stake your ETH, you have to make a transaction to the Beacon chain, and if you want to get the ETH back, you have to send the correct data to unlock it, the entrepreneur said. “It’s a very complicated process,” Rosenthal opined. And because it’s difficult for many to understand, they turn to centralized exchanges. This choice comes with its own set of security risks. Therefore, Myrmidon enabled people to stake their ETH, maintain ownership over it, and exit the staking position easily. “We’re trying to make a friendly UI for ETH staking, which is not very UI-friendly,” Rosenthal said. The downside of Myrmidon’s service is that it must support native ETH staking, which means that users must stake 32 ETH per validator. That said, “as of yet, we haven’t found one single provider [besides Myrmidon] who can safely say that they are truly non-custodial staking providers.” Hence, unlike Myrmidon, should something happen with the provider, the users’ ETH is gone forever. The Four Staking Categories: Pros and Cons Rosenthal went on to discuss the four categories of staking. These are solo home staking, staking-as-a-service, pooled staking, and centralized staking. He explained that we can observe these categories as listed from the most to the least decentralized, from the most difficult to the easiest, and from the most secure to the least secure. Solo home staking is the hardest and requires the most knowledge and work, given the constant updates. But it’s also the most decentralized, the most secure, and the most rewarding. Staking-as-a-service is what Myrmidon does. It’s a very decentralized way to stake ETH, and it’s also not easy. However, if you know how to operate a wallet, you can choose this option. Did you know #MyrmidonStaking offers a user-friendly platform for staking #Ethereum kinda like the launchpad? It's actually more like a dashboard and launchpad in one built right into our staking solution, which is 100% non-custodial No messing around with extra smart… pic.twitter.com/RvkXnncsyx — Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 9, 2024 Pool staking is a very popular solution. For one, it doesn’t require 32 ETH, but only 0.1 ETH. It’s easy and convenient. But the big issues are smart contract risk and centralization. The final option is the easiest and the riskiest one: centralized staking. Here, the centralized exchanges do the work for you. They don’t require 32 ETH either. At the same time, stakers give up control over their assets. Furthermore, the yield gets significantly lower as you go further down the list. For example, those who use staking-as-a-service, get all base rewards, hence they earn more. More Chains Incoming The Myrmidon team has so far primarily been focused on Ethereum. However, that’s not to say they haven’t worked with other chains or started planning support for additional chains. “You should definitely check our website because we’re going to pop up new networks over course of 2024,” Rosenthal said. Just recently, the team launched Cardano, which is “off to a great start.” Users can now delegate their ADA coins via Myrmidon. Hey #CardanoCommunity We are live with our cardano stake pool Name: Myrmidon Ticker: MYR Fixed cost: 170₳ Margin: 5% Some facts about #MyrmidonStaking (us) 1⃣ We host our nodes in house 2⃣ We are a non-custodial staking service provider 3⃣ We are a team of 5 people… pic.twitter.com/5myTN1ag2D — Myrmidon Staking (@Myrmidonstaking) April 3, 2024 They are also live with the Danish-founded blockchain Concordium. “We run the largest pool as a third-party provider for that ecosystem,” said Rosenthal. Therefore, the company supports three networks currently, while the fourth – Fleek – is expected to go live this summer, in Q3. Myrmidon will not launch any chains before it has customers on them, Rosenthal stressed. Running various networks without customers is wasting time and effort that can be put elsewhere. This is especially true for Myrmidon, which hosts everything in-house and does not rely on third parties like Amazon or Google Cloud. Additionally, they focused on setting up a second server on a different energy grid as another security layer, which can take over should anything happen to the first one. Therefore, there is plenty to do at all times. And with their dashboard launched and doing well, these are “great times, exciting times, exciting markets,” Rosenthal concluded. _________ About Nikolaj Rosenthal Nikolaj Rosenthal is the Co-Founder and CEO of Myrmidon, a non-custodial staking provider.

It is a huge implication for Ethereum as a project in development. EigenDA does not limit itself to the role of a validator service. It is a new mechanism that has improved the operation of the Ethereum validation systems as a whole. Announcing: EigenLayer ♾ EigenDA Mainnet Launch pic.twitter.com/bTp5BfnsKE — EigenLayer (@eigenlayer) April 9, 2024 The impact of EigenDA At the end of the line, EigenDA has already prompted over 4.1 million ETH staked on EigenLayer which is the community’s indictment of trust and the likelihood of the value of the offered service. To an extent that will astound you, 70% of the newly recognized Ethereum validators have chosen to restake at EigenLayer by giving their assets to the AVS. Being capable of staking is taking advantage of interacting with other protocols with one’s staking position on Ethereum intact. Such adaptability is of extreme value for backing the main Ethereum chain as well as smaller blockchains running on it that need the highly reliable security layer of Ethereum. Thus, EigenDA works as a middle layer, attaching itself to Ethereum miners, their tokens, and stakes to back up the next-gen blockchains as they emerge. In doing so, trust and security are increased, and different blockchains are interconnected in a resilient network. This ensures network stability and continuity across the board. This practice additionally covers core elements such as neutrality and decentralization in order to allow anyone to become a staking provider. Technological advances and needs of the near future As well as essential validation services, EigenDA is intended for providing extended scalability, as well as cost-efficiency and ease of integration for various rollup and blockchain applications, and operators. The Relayers or the Rollups, as they are widely popular, are now able to attach to the main EigenDA net effortlessly, thereby increasing the transactions’ potential. A year down the line, this integration will have stabilized, giving way to a more robust cycle of operators and delegators to provide added-value solutions of data storage on Ethereum. EigenDA and likewise AVS would be developed not only for technical improvement reasons but also to reconfirm Ethereum as a trustworthy and multi-purpose blockchain system. Ethereum’s staking functionality, deploying approximately a quarter of the entire network circulating supply (32.2 million ETH) in the staking pool, is making a way for EigenDA to wield key influence on the network in a time to come. At the moment, the total value of staked ETH stands higher than $112 billion – the coin that supports more than one million validators, such fact makes the Ethereum blockchain probably one of the most secure in the whole cryptocurrency industry. With the advent of crypto and blockchain landscapes turning out to be dynamic, the involvement of creative solutions such as EigenDA will be highly relevant in shaping the destiny of decentralized networks. Lido is today the undisputed Ethereum liquid staking leader with its inventory worth $33.2 billion, or 29% of the total staked amount – such is a vibrant and competitive landscape that EigenLayer will be entering. That is not only infrastructure improvement but also stimulates the validator services development within the blockchain industry.","category":["Industry News","EigenLayer"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e176","guid":"https://cryptonews.com/?p=197913","article_link":"https://cryptonews.com/news/hong-kong-set-to-approve-bitcoin-and-ether-etfs-as-early-as-monday.htm","website_source":"cryptonews","article_title":"Hong Kong Set to Approve Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as Early as Monday","author":"Thomas Musgrave","creation_date":"2024-04-13T02:24:15Z","thumbnail_image":"https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12190611/1712948771-1712948399458_processed.jpg","article_summary":"The potential approval of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in Hong Kong could occur as soon as Monday, with asset management firms like Harvest Fund Management anticipating the green light.

CSOP Ether Futures, Samsung Bitcoin Futures, and CSOP Bitcoin Futures collectively hold an estimated value of $170 million. Bitcoin ETFs Show Strong Inflows Since Launch Since the year began, Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to a resurgence in the cryptocurrency markets. By mid-April, the total assets under management for the 11 ETFs are projected to reach a record $73 billion, with $59 billion raised to date. The net flows into Blackrock’s iSharesBitcoin Trust have exceeded $15 billion in just three months. From the beginning of this week, Harvest was expected to get approval to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in the city. Both Harvest and China Asset Management were given approval by the SFC to supply virtual asset fund management services on April 9. Regulators Working to Allow Investors to Buy Spot ETFs Julia Leung, deputy chief executive director of intermediaries for the SFC, stated the regulator was “actively seeking to set up a regime to approve ETFs that provide investor guarails for airstream virtual assets”. Hong Kong’s crypto appeal had encountered a problem in the form of JPEX, an unlicensed crypto exchange responsible for an alleged $1.6 million in fraud.

The BRICS, which has been on a roll adding new countries since the start of 2024, might just swing its doors wide open for Serbia. There’s a growing trend among nations to ditch the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, and BRICS is smack in the middle of it, handing out invites to those who are down with this plan. So, is Serbia about to become the first Balkan star in the BRICS sky? Well, the word out is that BRICS rolled out the red carpet for Serbia to join them at their next summit in Russia later this year. This is huge because Serbia has been hanging around, waiting to get into the European Union since 2009, without much luck. Looks like they might just pivot to a different crew. Last year, Serbia’s Movement of Socialists got parliament to give the thumbs up to apply for BRICS membership. They were like, “Most of our folks think joining BRICS is the best move.” If Serbia shows up at the summit and gets in, they’ll be the first European country to crack into this group. Whoop, whoop! Let’s Talk Numbers This just in from the World Bank on Thursday. They’re bumping up Serbia’s economic growth forecast for 2024 to 3.5% from the earlier 3.0%. And it doesn’t stop there—things are expected to speed up to 3.8% in 2025 and hit 4.0% in 2026. But here’s the kicker: the Serbian economy’s got to pull off some serious structural moves to keep this party going, especially with the EU income levels in sight. And it’s not just about growth. The World Bank’s betting on a 5% inflation rate for Serbia this year, but they think it’ll chill out to 3.5% by 2025 and 3.2% the year after. As for the current account gap, that’s gonna widen to 3.6% of GDP this year from last year’s 2.6%, and don’t expect it to shrink anytime soon. On the flip side, Serbia’s fiscal deficit is set to shrink from 2.2% of GDP last year to 2.0% in 2024, and then down to 1.5% for the next couple of years. BRICS Going Big BRICS isn’t just Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa anymore, you know. They’ve welcomed Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE into the fold. Now since its start in 2009, BRICS has been sort of China-heavy on the trade front, with everyone else just tagging along. But lately, India’s started to catch up, thanks to its booming economy. But here’s the tea. Even though they’re tight, the rest of the BRICS gang doesn’t really trade much with each other compared to how much business they do with China. Interesting, huh? And with China pushing hard on the foreign policy gas pedal, they’ve been the big boss at the United Nations too, except for that one time Brazil didn’t toe the line on Ukraine in 2022. Okay so, China wants to expand BRICS even more to include a mix of countries that are either loaded with cash or seriously strapped for it, plus some major oil players like Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The big question is what BRICS can really pull off with such a mixed bag of countries and whether they can keep their goals straight post-expansion. They’re also hollering for some major changes at big institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, wanting a setup that really speaks for everyone, not just the big guns. Plus, they’re all about using local currencies for trade, especially with China, to keep things clear and fair in global trade. How this BRICS expansion turns out depends a lot on how they handle their internal stuff and what the rest of the world thinks about it. Whether the boys can keep up the momentum depends on a lot of things, like how China’s power plays out and how the rest of the BRICS members feel about it. With the diversity in the group, it could either be a huge win for everyone or a tricky path to tread, especially for India, feeling the heat from China. So, that’s the lowdown. Will my girl Serbia end up with a new set of powerful pals? I sure hope so! But let’s see.","category":["Economy","News","BRICS","Serbia"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e16c","guid":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/?p=201242","article_link":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/12/chainlink-guarding-transaction-with-new-bridge-app-transporter/","website_source":"thecoinrepublic","article_title":"Chainlink Guarding Transaction With New Bridge App ‘Transporter’","author":"Steve Anderrson","creation_date":"2024-04-13T04:44:00Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"Chainlink, a platform connecting public and private blockchains has launched a new bridge app ‘Transporter’ for making data and value transactions safer.

The issues related to security & scalability have persisted in the blockchain technology since its launch and require an effective solution. Chainlink (LINK), a decentralized blockchain oracle network streaming on Ethereum, introduced a new bridge app ‘Transporter’ for safer data transfer. The Bridge app is available on a few of the blockchains including Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Optimism, etc. Chainlink’s New Bridge App Details On Thursday, April 11, to mitigate the challenge of security, Chainlink introduced a new bridge app ‘Transporter’ for safer data and value transfer. The new application will permit users to transfer the tokens and data across different blockchains without any security concerns and is available for individuals and institutions. The aim is to offer the best and most cost-effective way to make high-value token transfers effortless and secure. The new bridge was developed on Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) technology, which is mainly used by SWIFT for shifting large token volumes and messages to other networks in a safe way. Additionally, the technology is used by banks for international money transfers. Apart from top-notch security, the platform also supports real-time visual tracking to check the status of transfers between blockchains. The platform charges the regular fee for using the technology and includes the cost of executing the transaction on different blockchains and fees paid to CCIP service providers. The Transporter application is currently available for blockchains including Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and WEMIX. Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink addressed the new bridge app ‘Transporter’. “Having a secure way to move both value and data across chains is something the blockchain industry has needed for years,”, Nazarov added. Bridges play a crucial role in interconnecting the individual blockchain rails, permitting the transaction of value and data in between. According to DefiLlama data, the existing bridges have transferred around across different chains last month. However, all these bridges are the targets of exploits and hacks, holding chances of user data loss. Chainlink’s Upcoming Events Chainlink is a platform connecting the world of blockchains and is actively engaged in innovations and inventions. After the launch of ‘Transporter,’ the platform is ready to work on its upcoming projects like Chainlink SmartCon and Introducing the Chainlink Block Magic Hackathon. Chainlink SmartCon is an event going to be organized in Hong Kong between October 30 and 31, 2024. The event involves digital asset leaders, DeFi pioneers, and on-chain builders who will come together to discuss technological topics and invent the future of global markets. Another upcoming event on Chainlink is Block Magic, which is going to be organized from April to June and involves different events like Chainlink Bootcamp, workshops, Hackathon kick-off, and Project submission deadline. According to CoinMarketCap data, Chainlink is currently trading at $17.44 after an upsurge of 0.64% in the past 1 day and has a market cap of $10,236,002,394. The coin has a 24-volume of $277,908,962, a maximum supply of 1 Million, and a circulating supply of 587,099,970.","category":["news","Chainlink","Chainlink (LINK) Price Prediction"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e167","guid":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/?p=201258","article_link":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/12/axs-crypto-analysis-shows-rapid-price-drop-can-it-keep-up/","website_source":"thecoinrepublic","article_title":"AXS Crypto Analysis Shows Rapid Price Drop, Can It Keep Up?","author":"Anurag S","creation_date":"2024-04-13T07:16:00Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"1 Active addresses reflect user participation in transactions over time, showing a decline in activity and potential impact on AXS price. 2 The Axie Infinity price asset plunged below the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, reliant on the sellers’ surge could deteriorate more.

The price of AXS asset has been displaying bearish behavior and has been declining consistently on the daily chart, indicating a potential further downward trend. The asset’s performance was poor last week and last month, with a drop of -3.59% and -25.95%, respectively, which suggests a stable downtrend. The price of Axie Infinity crypto has significantly dropped in recent times. This decline was evident as the price plunged from a crucial level of approximately $13.50 on the chart. AXS crypto is deteriorating at faster pace, as it meets the resistance level and could dive to new lows from the current price. The Axie Infinity price asset plunged below the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. Likewise, the AXS price asset is displaying bearish characteristics as MACD is below the zero line at -0.73 and the RSI is falling smoothly below the median line at 41.60, implying that the Axie Infinity asset is losing momentum and can achieve new depths in the coming sessions. At press time, the AXS crypto had experienced a 1.99% decline in the last 24 hours to $9.36. Therefore, if the Axie Infinity price fails to stay above the $8.50 level, it could decline further and reach lower lows. However, if the demand for the crypto remains high, the AXS asset price could bounce back from the current level by surpassing the below trendline. The next goal for Axie Infinity is to reach $11.0 and $12.0. AXS Volume Analysis Upon examining the AXS chart, it becomes evident that there was a surge in trading volume on or around March 10th, 2024. This increase in volume suggests that there was a notable uptick in both interest and market activity regarding the Axie Infinity token at that particular moment in time. It is worth noting that the volume had previously surpassed the $600 Million mark. However, from March 11th, 2024 onwards, volume continued to fall, and a significant descent in AXS activity was observed which illustrated decreased demand and excitement about Axie Infinity price. The trading volume depleted from $600 Million to the low of $250 Million by April 8th on the chart. AXS Crypto Active Addresses Declining The count of active addresses in the AXS refers to the number of unique addresses of Axie Infinity users who have participated in one or more transactions within a specific timeframe. Within the last hour, there were 31 transactions, in the past 24 hours, the number of transactions involving different addresses in Axie Infinity was 357, in the past 7 days were 1529, and in the last 30 days, there were 6907 transactions involving unique addresses in the AXS asset. This data indicates that the number of people who are involved in using and trading the AXS is decreasing. As a result, the demand and value for the Axie Infinity price may also be decreasing due to the decreasing number of active addresses over time. These terms are used to highlight the short-term and long-term trends of AXS crypto’s activity and its adoption. Summary The AXS asset price is falling, showing bearish signs on the daily chart. Last week and last month saw poor performances with drops of 3.59% and 25.95%, indicating a stable downtrend. From March 11th, 2024, AXS volume fell significantly, indicating decreased demand for Axie Infinity. Trading volume dropped from $600 Million to $250 Million by April 8th. Active addresses reflect user participation in transactions over time, showing a decline in activity and potential impact on AXS value.

Ollo Sib, a senior researcher at WFP, pointed out, “The economic situation is now a major force driving the food crisis, especially in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, where inflation hits hardest.” Rising Costs and Economic Policies Staple grain prices have soared to ten times their five-year average due to the plummeting value of local currencies and escalated fuel and transport costs. This year, the region faces a daunting 12 million ton deficit in cereal production. Pandemic-era restrictions on food exports have also hampered trade, reducing food availability. Sib elaborated, “The spike in food and transportation costs is creating a long-term impact, as all these countries depend on imported food.” Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, reports over 26 million people struggling with food security, up from 25 million last year. Eastern Chad, usually sufficient in food, now reports record food insecurity levels due to the influx of refugees escaping the civil war in Sudan. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on Nigeria to urgently address its escalating food insecurity, with nearly 10% of its population affected. The country’s ongoing economic reforms, such as eliminating fuel subsidies and loosening currency controls—though popular with investors—have accelerated inflation to the highest rate in nearly 30 years. Economic Performance and Projections The IMF stresses, “Addressing rising food insecurity is now a critical policy priority.” Nigeria’s recent move to implement a cash transfer system for vulnerable households is a significant step, though its success depends on effective implementation. Amid a food price inflation rate of 35.4%, Nigeria has seen protests and looting in various parts, including Abuja. Over 40% of its population lives in extreme poverty. To combat inflation and stabilize the currency, Nigeria’s central bank has increased interest rates to a record 22.75%. The naira has lost about 70% of its value against the dollar since mid-2023. More hikes in borrowing costs are expected. The World Bank has flagged that sluggish growth in Nigeria could dampen the entire sub-region’s economic outlook. The lender’s report predicts an increase in economic activity in Western and Central Africa, from 3.2% in 2023 to 3.7% in 2024, and further to 4.2% by 2025–2026. However, growth is hindered by Nigeria’s lower-than-average performance. Excluding Nigeria, the sub-region could grow by 4.4% in 2024 and 5% in 2025–2026. Meanwhile, the West African Economic and Monetary Union is expected to see growth rates of 5.9% in 2024 and 6.2% in 2025, bolstered by strong economic activities in Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Niger, and Senegal. The World Bank notes that Nigeria’s growth is anticipated at 3.3% in 2024 and 3.6% in the following years, as reforms slowly take effect. It also expects a stabilization in the oil sector with a recovery in production and slightly lower prices, leading to a more stable macroeconomic environment and sustained growth in the non-oil economy.","category":["Economy","News","West Africa"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e179","guid":"https://cryptonews.com/?p=197915","article_link":"https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-april-12-btt-cro-bnb.htm","website_source":"cryptonews","article_title":"Best Crypto to Buy Now April 12 – BTT, CRO, BNB","author":"Joel Frank","creation_date":"2024-04-13T00:33:38Z","thumbnail_image":"https://cryptonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1705951003-imgpsh_fullsize_anim__4_.jpeg","article_summary":"As blue-chip cryptocurrencies consolidate within recent ranges, with Bitcoin (BTC) continuing to swing either side of $70,000, traders and investors are looking for the best crypto to buy now in the altcoin market that might offer the prospect of quick gains.

Major cryptocurrencies have been indecisive this week as traders weigh various themes. Bitcoin, last trading in the upper $68,000s, has swing between lows around $67,500 and highs around $72,500 this week. Traders continue to monitor themes such as easing GBTC outflows, the prospect of near-term spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in Hong Kong, hotter-than-expected US economic data pushing back on Fed rate cut bets and next week’s halving event. BREAKING: Hong Kong set to approve spot #Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs by Monday – Bloomberg Up to $25 Billion in demand for Bitcoin from China is expected to be unlocked. pic.twitter.com/6h6zVuNkRq — Radar (@RadarHits) April 12, 2024 There are some nerves about a short-term dip in the Bitcoin market in wake of the halving. But technicals paint a bullish picture for BTC. Bitcoin has been consistently posting higher lows in recent weeks. Meanwhile, its price has continued to top out in the low $70,000s. Bitcoin to $80,000 Next? That means Bitcoin has been forming a bullish ascending triangle structure. Such structures generally form ahead of bullish breakouts. If Bitcoin is to break convincingly to the north of its current 2024 highs near-$74,000, $80,000 could be next. Bitcoin could be the best crypto to buy now, as it threatens a pennant breakout towards $80,000 / Source: TradingView The bears could regain control and send Bitcoin back to the low $60,000s or even $50,000s. But such a retracement wouldn’t snap the thesis that BTC remains in a bull market. Throughout its history, within a few months of the halving, Bitcoin has always pumped to new record highs. Add to that picture that the US continues to run a big deficit, that rate cuts are coming sooner or later, that ETF demand should continue to act as a long-term tailwind, and that the 2024 Presidential election could see the US political and regulatory landscape shift in a more pro-crypto direction, $100,000 remains on the cards for later this year. For investors looking to get involved in crypto, Bitcoin has to be one of the best crypto to buy now. But some investors looking for bigger than 2x potential gains will be looking to smaller, lesser-known altcoins. Indeed, many altcoins could article gains of as much as 5-10x this bull market. Here are some strong performers on Friday that could be the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now BitTorrent (BTT) BitTorrent (BTT) is one of the few cryptos trading in the green on Friday as the BTC price turns lower. It was last up 6.5% in 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading in the $0.0000015s. And BTT’s gains could be able to accelerate. The cryptocurrency appears to have formed an ascending triangle. A break above resistance could see it pump higher towards $0.0000022. BTT’s gains could be able to accelerate, making it potentially the best crypto to buy now / Source: TradingView As a result, in a broadly bearish market, BTT could be the best crypto to buy now. Cronos (CRO) Crypto.com’s EVM-compatible blockchain Cronos (CRO) is another crypto holding up well on Friday. It was last trading with gains of roughly 2% in the past 24 hours near $0.15, as per CoinMarketCap. Its low market cap of under $4 billion, despite its link to one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, suggests plenty of room left for growth this bull market. With 5x gains possible, CRO could be the best crypto to buy now. BNB (BNB) The world’s fourth-largest crypto BNB (BNB) is another strong performer on Friday, also up 2% in 24 hours. As per CoinMarketCap, BNB was last trading just above $610, with its market cap hovering around $91.5 billion. Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher. Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play. Like Bitcoin, BNB is forming an ascending triangle and could be about to pump higher. Its record highs around $700 could soon come into play.

Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer investors the opportunity to potentially make quick gains. But some traders are on the lookout for much faster gains than major altcoins can offer. These traders often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project’s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.

The article Fraud Victims Call on China to Assist in Recovering $4.3B Bitcoin Seized by UK Police appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_detailed_content":"The victims of an investment fraud scheme have called on China to negotiate with the UK government to recover 61,000 Bitcoin seized in a money laundering investigation, valued at $4.3 billion at the time of publication. This Bitcoin is the result of a $6.2 Billion wealth management fraud conducted between 2014 and 2017, fronted by Chinese company Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. In which, more than 128,000 people were defrauded. The UK government became aware of the situation after ex-restaurant worker Jian Wen attempted to launder funds by purchasing a $30 million property with Bitcoin. However, the transaction could not be completed since Wen was unable to explain the source of the funds. This prompted an investigation, which culminated in a raid on a property rented by “front person” Wen and her boss Zhimin Qian, the suspected mastermind of the operation. During the raid, investigators seized 61,000 Bitcoins, worth $1.7 billion at the time. Under pressure to explain the damning situation, Wen initially claimed that Bitcoin was mined. She eventually changed her story, stating it was a “love present” from Qian, who fled the country after the raid. Jian Wen was ultimately put on trial for assisting Qian in converting Bitcoin into cash, jewellery, and property. While Wen denied all charges, Southwark Crown Court convicted her guilty of three counts of money laundering on March 20th. Bitcoin Seized: The Victims Want What is Rightfully Theirs Following the conviction, a group representing the scam victims set out to reclaim the Bitcoin purchased with their money, now worth $4.3 billion. The group reportedly submitted a letter to China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to negotiate with the UK government for the return of the “huge amount” of seized Bitcoin. They also contacted China’s Ministry of Public Security, claiming to have the backing of almost 2,500 signatures from the victims, and want to submit them to both ministries. The letter requests that the Chinese government and the UK judicial departments work together to submit evidence proving their status as “legitimate owners.” The group said: “We do not want, and will never accept, a situation where Bitcoins are confiscated by the UK and not returned to us.” At the time of writing, the UK government had not issued a statement on how it intends to deal with the Bitcoin it holds, and Qian is still at large. However, if the UK government evaluates that no one else was entitled to the asset, it would typically be divided and distributed to the police and Home Office. However, the victims who “suffered extremely serious economic losses, resulting in family breakdown, separation from their children, indebtedness, and no money for medical treatment,” have not gone without aid. Four victims who lost money in the scam claim that, since last May, victims who enrolled with Chinese police have received two pay-outs from a task group on the fraud, headed by Tianjin authorities. They stated that 8% and 5% of their investment capital had been returned with assets recovered from Lantian Gerui and its former employees. Additionally, a local branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country’s largest lender, has committed to assisting with the return process and has estimated that 207,000 people invested in the fraudulent scheme.

The removal of the stocking limit time constraints is forecasted to facilitate a more self-sustaining system and more dynamism in staking. Therefore, larger number of participants within the system will be generated and this will result in more chances for them. Enhancing stability and growth The scheme of EigenLayer’s evolution is composed to drive stability and build up the platform ecosystem around Ethereum. Thus, the initial period is reflected through stages 1, 2, and 3, which are the vital days of the system that involved the positive development of restakers, operators, AVSs (Actively Validated Services), and rollups. Contrastively, the previous LST cap, which meant less room for the network to grow, is now the promoter of the activation of the network and also, because the protocol awards try to balance the neutrality and the decentralization at the network, by suggesting a 33% cap for users. The methodology thus conceived by EigenLayer will effectively mean that the same ETH staked now can be repurposed or used to safeguard other parts of the ecosystem as well. The idea of cryptography security another setting emerges in Ethereum main chain. The protocol has already received 3,880,000 ETH (equivalent to $12,670,000,000 of market value) to be staked by restakers meaning that the number of these stakers is only growing as the protocol becomes more relevant to them. The employment of main players such as Coinbase Staking as operators highlight the oncoming restaking industry faith, however, supervisory activities must also be on top of it, since its rapid growth gives way to financial and security risks. The fundraising program of EigenLayer does not only serve as the reinforcement of Ethereum network but it also initiates simpler infrastructure for the development of decentralized and permissionless apps based on Ethereum network. This definitely may have strong influence within the entire DeFi domain, and can as a result result in advancement of more precise security solutions.","category":["Industry News","EigenLayer"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e189","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=511344","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-and-behavioral-science-a-unified-path/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","article_title":"AI and Behavioral Science: A Unified Path to Innovation","author":"Benson Mawira","creation_date":"2024-04-15T03:20:30Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_AI_and_Behavioral_Science_A_Unified_Path_to_Innovation_0.jpg","article_summary":"Consequently, tech development benefits a wider range of analysis and social relativity techniques.

Thus, the intertwining of AI and behavioral science infers that the future will depend on our will, meaning what we want out of life largely depends on all of us. Some things were presented in a movie adapted from the book Consilience, chapter “Consilience,” where Edward O. Wilson brilliantly demonstrated the disciplines that sometimes are basically in the conflict in the book. This was the way of “joining disciplines” into a single scientific explanation of human existence, and the social complexities of evolution were shown. Nevertheless, it is just a step towards smart dawn that raises many questions, the foremost of which is which roads are most likely to be followed. The other thing is that new marketing channels will cause automation promotion and behavioral decision-making. Also, the legality issue should not be overlooked because such an invention will surely make the world look quite different. Unlocking insights: Behavioral data analysis Despite this fact, it is necessary to analyze the potential of AI in its capability of filling the huge void of behavioral data that cannot be disclosed as the very first and the very primary prerequisite that gives AI the ability to obtain amazingly accurate details of human life that the human eye just can not see. Regarding the novelty characteristics of AI, after the appearance of AI artifacts, the development of AI beings commences. If I were to name the AI artifacts that are AI’s offspring, I would call them AI child offspring. Another significant power for organizations is enriching the employees with knowledge and advanced things and selecting the topmost services. In computer science, using examples, they will be process-oriented and learned. They will also be grounded on rules and may be used for student studies or data processing. Employing sensory science provides the means to influence the audience via sensory strategies that involve much of the central system or directly invoke psychological motivators, social units, and social facilitators. The general outcome of these efforts is to hold each trait of AI, ranging from artificial neural networks to machine vision or natural language processors, which improves the AI’s analytical powers. This can give customers highly sophisticated information that contrasts with operations and strategies presented in their businesses, boosting innovation and company growth. People of this type were turning to progressively greater assimilation, resulting in the abundant wasting of their time and effort to only some small parts. It is also not to forget that the aim of today’s psychological content is devoid of the element of humanness. Psychology may be like a preventive mental health action with a mission to protect people’s welfare and the environment from harmful substances. Health instruction is an example of a system that, rather than allowing people to go on any sabotage, saves them in healthy ways to improve their mental health and apply customization and personalization, which are beneficial. In other words, despite a considerable gap (a result of the different number of years), we can recognize many similarities between the mankind of the past and us. Mobile skills, combined with human mindset knowledge, make more complicated activities for psychologists – such as robot developers engaged in interventions and change corrections – and those organizations hire most often to introduce changes that will improve workplace satisfaction. This is also true because such changes will make the employees much more satisfied and depressed to a lesser extent. While these people whose lives are not just giving a pace as well as the progress of the universe, unending progress, and at the same time those people who are left abruptly are alone, it is a large number for that society. The two cases of society depicting the consequences of the revolt are the collapse of the societal arrangements and the order in the society being restored. Ethical integration: Ensuring human-centric AI Therefore, socially, the parts of the technology could be paired up in progress. Besides, modern bioethics will have to tackle moral issues that are more holistic than they used to. Therefore, the ethical engine somewhat inserts ethics when the ethics that AI has to adhere to by default are included in the condition of the machine’s operation. For society, a well-defined societal order and law would be the priority so that the immigration of people with different lifestyles and ways of living into the new environment could be smooth and easy. Finally, science deals with psychology, the domain we humans already know from the core. Furthermore, the other main constituents of such ethical science are the establishment of philosophy, the cognitive moral processes, and the social moral norms, which are undoubtedly of great value/significance. Briefly, AI applications can even solve specific business ethics; so to speak, they can solve even ethical problems at an atomic scale. Similarly, presenting ethics’ value and role while dealing with behavioral science during development will be a stepping stone toward more opportunities. Last but not least is the issue of bias in algorithmic decision-making, which can, however, be successfully resolved with the following: Values-based AI, on the other hand, through the utilization of their lives to enhance the efforts aimed at diagnosis and finding solutions for more civility in the world, would always expect that peace had been well-maintained. Artificial intelligence and behavioral science raise the speculative question: will we need people to use such devices with computers only managing the process helped with the data? AI and BD-oriented smart systems would be helpful for the administration in their quick assessment and in understanding the similar feelings of people undergoing different moods, especially the situations that would be politically transparent as to how they influence family life and society in general. The sign on the door can say ‘Man-machine relationship’ or ‘Man and machine.’ However, this journey is also very interesting and sometimes challenging because many people have recently tried to figure out this connection between humans and machines. Our pondering about that can eventually grow to the scale of the universe, which is non-linear and full of chaos and freedom. This may even result in a kind of foresight on the part of the companies that launch their naturalistic creations as a means of acquiring something deeper. This development comes with an economy of machines that excel in automation, and additionally, their manner of processing and production has become the season-controlling idea. Humans pull forward and rebuild their lives after the tragedy through this approach.

Justice Mellor found that: 1) Dr Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper. 2) Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto. 3) Dr Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System. 4) Dr Wright is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software. 1/4 — COPA (@opencryptoorg) March 14, 2024 “For over eight years, Dr. Wright and his financial backers have lied about his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto and used that lie to bully and intimidate developers in the bitcoin community,” COPA posted to their X account shortly after the ruling. “That ends today with the court’s ruling that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto.” In fact, a recent linguistic analysis of Satoshi Nakamoto’s writing shows that the enigmatic founding father of crypto may be a collective group, not just one individual. Shortly after the ruling, UK Judge James Mellor froze the entirety of Wright’s assets after he attempted to transfer several of his London firm’s shares to a Singapore-based entity, potentially in a bid to evade financial penalties related to the case.

HashKey Global Brief HashKey Global presently provides spot trading services for 21 digital assets, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Tether’s USDT, and Circle’s USDC. They plan to introduce futures trading product services in the coming weeks. The company, similar to Coinbase, has chosen Bermuda as its global exchange base, thanks to the nation’s regulatory regime that has proved to be very suitable for them to expand from, after seeing Coinbase’s success in Bermuda. TON & Hashkey Partner Ship Telegram initiated the TON blockchain as an internal project in 2018. However, two years later, due to legal action by the SEC, the project was abandoned. Following this, the TON Foundation was formed by the community with Telegram’s backing, to carry on with the development of the project. HashKey and the Foundation are focusing their partnership on Hong Kong in the first phase but said they will expand to other APAC markets should their initial efforts prove a success, according to an emailed announcement on Friday. Toncoin, the native token of TON, climbed approximately 1.7% in the hour following the announcement and was down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. For comparison, the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which shows a weighted measurement of the digital asset market, declined around 1.3% in the same timeframe. TON Foundation Distributed 300k Toncoins The Open Network’s TON Foundation distributed 300,000 Toncoin to active meme coin traders on the DeDust and Ston.fi platforms, valued at roughly $2.19 Million. The airdrop targeted traders who engaged in transactions between March 4 and April 10. Participants needed to trade specific meme coins and accumulate points to qualify for the reward. The distribution gave 90 free tokens per eligible wallet, excluding Sybil addresses to ensure fairness. Toncoin reached a new all-time high before the announcement, surging more than 14% to $7.65 per token. However, after the news, TON’s price fell by 5% to $7.22.

For those wondering, yes I am running the @shork_coin twitter All off good vibes, no current position (will change likely) You are in good hands frens Lets #shork — Gannon Breslin (@gannonbreslin) April 12, 2024 The SHORK token appears to have been created by serial founder Gannon Breslin, an associate of the HeniousPumps newsletter. SHORK Price Analysis: Is Shork Coin On The Verge of a Second Rally Leg? As price action pushes to the upside once more, SHORK is currently trading at a market price of $0.035 (representing a 24-hour change of +15,030%). This comes after the token launched at just Midnight UTC in a DEX listing on Raydium. It gained almost instant traction, and its price surged +10,000% in the first three hours. Resistance at $0.062 sent the price tumbling into a strong consolidation pattern above lower support at $0.0225, setting the stage for a further push to SHORK’s current all-time high at $0.067. Yet, with the all-time high delivering +50,000% returns to SHORK holders, early-backed moved for a quickfire sell-off around 6 AM UTC – sending the price tumbling back to support. However, defying expectations, the support level has once again been successfully defended by holders – and SHORK price is once again on the climb – teasing the potential of a second rally leg. The volatile price action has been fuelled by significant interest from retail investors, represented by an impressive $58m in 24-hour trading volume. Now standing at a $41m market cap, interest threatens to wane, with the prospect of a major return for late-stage investors diminished to a generous 5x expectation at these levels. Remarkably, despite more than 8,000 holders, bulls remain in control – with buy pressure representing 51% of transactions over the past hour. In other news, a multi-chain dog-themed cryptocurrency is also doing rounds after unlocking viral success at presale with its promise to unify DOGE cross-chain. Enter the Omnichain Dogeverse: The New Kid on the Block Touted as the “chain traveling Doge,” Dogeverse has multi-chain functionality across major networks like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, making it a versatile contender in the meme coin arena. With 15% of its 200 billion supply up for grabs at a starting price of $0.000292 per token, early investors stand to gain significantly. The project’s structure and potential for high returns, including a staggering +582% APY return for stakers, underline its ambitious roadmap. Beyond its playful facade, Dogeverse introduces real utility, offering seamless integration across different blockchain environments – this feature not only enhances accessibility but also adds a layer of convenience for investors.

The article Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 4% Overnight – What’s Going On? appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_detailed_content":"Floki Inu has fallen by 4% in the past 24 hours, with the FLOKI price sinking to $0.0001929 as the wider crypto market sees a very slight 0.5% dip today. While FLOKI is up by 2.5% in a week, it has now declined by 30% in a week, although the popular meme coin has posted a 460% increase in the last 12 months. This is very impressive performance, and with FLOKI remaining popular among retail investors and whales, it could easily see a recovery in the coming weeks. This is particularly the case when the market is waiting on a possible surge, which could coincide with the next Bitcoin halving on April 20. Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Drops 4% Overnight – What’s Going On? One encouraging feature of FLOKI’s chart is that it has bounced a little in the past hour, after dropping earlier this morning. This could mean that it has bottomed out as far as its recent decline is concerned, a claim which receives some tentative reinforcement from its support line (green). Source: TradingView It’s also notable that FLOKI’s 30-day average (orange) has reached what looks like a bottom in relation to the 200-day (blue), implying that the coin has entered an oversold position and is ready to rebound. Having said that, FLOKI’s trading volume remains largely lowkey at $150 million, whereas it rose as high as $2 billion in early March. What we can take from this is that whales have yet to return to the meme token, despite having pumped it vigorously in the weeks preceding its last big surge. $FLOKI: It seems that price is still in a wave-iv correction. Ideal target for wave-C is the 100% Fib extension level at $0.000137. A break above $0.000266 would be the first sign that wave-iv already has bottomed. pic.twitter.com/RSt5KjF9bi — Man of Bitcoin (@Manofbitcoin) April 12, 2024 Yet given that the coin has been down for several weeks now, it may be a good time to buy it, given that it’s selling at a relative discount. Indeed, the next week or so may see the crypto market rally as a whole, helped by the incoming Bitcon halving, which is due in eight days. And the Floki price could ride any resulting bull market, with the token continuing to attract new exchange listings that could support it in the long run. More importantly, it also has a detailed and ambitious roadmap that should help improve its utility and fundamentals. FLOKI ROADMAP: WHAT’S NEXT ON OUR AGENDA… From the get-go, we’ve been VERY clear about our goal for Floki: To be the most known and most used cryptocurrency in the world. Our new roadmap outlines how we intend to achieve this:https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH pic.twitter.com/hBydq4D4lX — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) March 22, 2024 For this reason, the Floki price should reach $0.00025 in the next couple of months, before reaching $0.00035 in the latter half of the year. Newer Meme Tokens May Bring Bigger Returns While FLOKI remains one of the most popular meme coins in the market, it isn’t the only promising token available right now. Numerous newer meme coins have emerged in the past few weeks, with several holding presales that not only help support their development, but also help them attract supporters prior to listing. One coin doing this is Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE), a multi-chain meme token that has raised more than $2.8 million in its increasingly popular sale. Embracing Inclusive Accessibility! $DOGEVERSE opens its doors to a wide audience, from #Ethereum aficionados to those preferring the rapid, cost-effective benefits of #Solana or #Polygon, fostering a diverse and inclusive community. pic.twitter.com/sXPOvaoz67 — DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 12, 2024 What’s so exciting about Dogeverse is that it’s one of the only meme tokens in the market to make itself multi-chain. It will launch on Ethereum, before bridging to Polygon, BNB Chain, Solana, Avalanche and Base. What this means is that it will find applications and uses in multiple ecosystems and platforms, something which could raise its demand in relation to other similar tokens. It also comes with bullish tokenomics, with its capped supply of 200 million tokens ultimately making it a deflationary token. And unlike the original Dogecoin, holders will be able to stake DOGEVERSE, earning themselves a passive income in addition to any price gains. #DOGEVERSE bringing in optimized costs and speed! Users enjoy the ability to choose chains with lower transaction fees and faster processing times, significantly enhancing the trading and transaction experience. pic.twitter.com/phcMnBhwLT — DogeVerse (@The_DogeVerse) April 11, 2024 All in all, the use of multiple chains will make DOGEVERSE one of the fastest and most useful tokens in the crypto ecosystem. Investors can join its presale by heading over to the official Dogeverse website, where 1 DOGEVERSE currently costs $0.000293. The presale has an allocation of 15% of the coin’s overall supply, with 10% going to staking and 50% going to marketing and project funds (a further 15% goes to liquidity and another 10% to its ecosystem). Given how quickly the sale is raising money, it may sell out fairly soon, so interested parties are advised to act quickly.

During the course of the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has fallen sharply from the highs of $70,760 to the current level of $67,490, which constitutes about a 7% downwards movement. In the same manner, after a fallover of more than 10% that started from $3,525, Ethereum was trading at $3,161. Despite a slight recovery that led Ethereum to $3,259 and BTC to $67,472, the sharped decline spilled over into the market with some of the smaller players having to sell their holdings. Cryptocurrency liquidation totaled approximately $735 million overnight in a sign that this downturn has affected everybody regardless of what they trade in. Venues and the expected BTC halving. The timetable of this crash is very interesting as it falls on the brink of the bitcoin halving event which is set to take place on 21st, April. This event, which slashes the number of new bitcoins produced per block by 50%— from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC—is monitored carefully by the crypto community. Conventionally, halving moments usually are digits of rising market mood, mainly, people dream of the same situation. After the recent drop, a correction might take place, potentially leading to an increase after halving. Dogecoin could be one of the crypto’s that profit from this event. Markus’s remark is simply a short line with the purpose to remind us of us always-present volatility within crypto market combined with humorous portrayal of it, which spice it all up. In light of the coming halving event, his way of thinking provides the community with a distinctively upbeat view from the usual turmoils that continuously rock the virtual crypto world.","category":["News","dogecoin"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e16d","guid":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/?p=201168","article_link":"https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/04/12/breaking-news-earn-e500-a-day/","website_source":"thecoinrepublic","article_title":"Breaking News! ! !

This was announced by Paul Dietrich, chief investment strategist at B. Riley Wealth. U.S. stocks hit new highs again this week after chipmaker Nvidia posted a wildly upbeat earnings report. But the higher the stocks rise, the more likely they are to fall into a potential recession. The economy will experience a mild recession, but even a moderate slowdown could trigger a stock market crash of up to 40%, sending the S&P 500 down about 3,000 points. Various data indicate that there may be a global economic crisis in the future, so how can ordinary people save themselves from the economic crisis?

John Deaton’s Campaign Fundraising As reported by Eleanor Terret of Fox Business, the lawyer-turned-senate hopeful raised $1.36 million for his campaign Q1, compared to Warren’s $1.1 million. “According to his campaign, Deaton has received donations from prominent figures in the crypto industry such as Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Charles Hoskinson, Jameson Lopp, and Anthony Scaramucci,” Terret wrote to X on Friday.

Deaton’s history with the crypto industry is no secret. He’s best known for representing 75,000 XRP holders in a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that closed last year, which mostly panned out in Ripple’s favor. He’s also blasted the SEC for harshly treating the crypto industry in several other high-profile lawsuits, including its fight with Grayscale – the issuer of the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF. The result of that lawsuit ultimately forced the SEC into allowing Bitcoin spot ETFs to trade, which Elizabeth Warren loudly disapproved of. Is Elizabeth Warren Worried? Beyond crypto, Warren and Deaton fiercely disagree on other partisan topics: student loan forgiveness, the migrant crisis, and loose monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. “I’ve beaten the odds as an underdog my entire life and I’m going to do it again. The only difference this time, is the world will get to witness it,” Deaton wrote to X on Friday. A friend of mine is a registered Democrat in Texas.

Israel is braced for a counterattack from Iran after they recently took out IRGC military leaders in Syria. Reports emerged on Friday that the US is moving warships to ready itself to defend Israel. JUST IN: The United States has pledged to DEFEND ISRAEL if Iran attacks. Iran has stated this will make the US a target of Iran. pic.twitter.com/Esn0bPXWFX — Jackson Hinkle (@jacksonhinklle) April 12, 2024 Tensions have been high in the Middle East since the October 7th Hamas attack against Israel, and Israel’s devastating counterattack into Gaza. Bitcoin was a relative safe haven versus most of the market, dropping just 4.5% to $67,000. That leaves it still only about 9% down from its recent record highs near $74,000. With Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a form of digital gold, it could even rally if Iran/Israel/US tensions rise further. But with the halving around the corner and Fed rate cut bets fading, investors may remain reluctant to pile in. They may instead be eyeing up opportunities in the highly illiquid and volatile on-chain shitcoin markets. On-chain markets refer to the market for tokens that are issued directly onto blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. The name “shitcoin” refer to the fact that most of these tokens are scams, pump-and-dumps, or lacking in real utility. But on-chain shitcoin markets are also one of the only places where traders are able to secure gains of 10x or more in under 24 hours. Here are the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be watching, as per DEXTools. As a reminder, potential investors should always do their own research into tokens and never risk more than they can afford to lose. Top Crypto Gainers Today 42 times 10 (420) A just-launched meme coin called 42 times 10 (420) is up 1,750% on Friday, as per DEXTools. Despite these big gains, the token’s market cap was last around $150,000, with only around $40,000 in liquidity. The token also still has less than 100 holders and only saw $28,000 in trading volumes over the past 24 hours. As per DEXTools’ smart contract audit, the token has three concerning aspects to its smart contract. Traders should be very careful with this highly illiquid shitcoin. WojakPepe (WOPE) A new hybrid version of the Pepe and Wojak meme coins called WojakPepe (WOPE) is up 550% on Friday. That’s as per DEXTools, who puts the token’s market cap at $1 million and liquidity at $100,000. The token last had just over 550 holders and 24 hour trading volumes of $6,2 million. Not bad for a first day of trade. That being said, the token has two concerning aspects to its smart contract, as per DEXTools. The utility of the token also isn’t clear. So traders should be very cautious with this shitcoin. pepcoin (PEP) A new meme coin claimed to be the “retard cousin ov Pepe” called pepcoin (PEP) is up 1,150% on Friday. But, as per DEXTools, it market cap was last only around $60,000 with $25,000 in liquidity and 220 holders. That means a very small volume of sales could trigger a huge price crash. Traders should be very cautious of such an illiquid coin. A Better Way to Make Quick Gains Shitcoins offer the prospect of quick gains, but are very risky. That’s not just due to their illiquidity and volatility. Its also due to the fact that most are scams of some sort, or pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project’s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first. Luckily, analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time combing the presale market for promising projects. Here are their 18 favorite presales right now.

According to the economists surveyed by Reuters, they’re predicting that the UK’s annual inflation is going to chill a bit to 3.1% in March, down from February’s 3.4%. That’s the lowest it’s been since the middle of 2021. But let’s not throw a party yet, guys, because even with this drop, inflation’s still sitting higher than the Bank of England’s comfort zone at 2%. Keeping an Eye on the Core Not just the regular numbers, but the core inflation, which basically ignores the up and down drama of food and energy prices, is also expected to take a small step back to 4.3% from last month’s 4.5%. What this means is the Bank of England might not get too happy with slashing rates too much this year. Just last week, those who bet on these things pushed their expectations of a rate cut from June to August. Why? Because the U.S. dropped a surprise with stronger-than-anticipated inflation for the third time in a row. Tuesday’s also a big day with labour market stats hitting the stands. Everyone’s watching this because it’s got a lot to say about wage growth. Hot wages have been keeping the service sector inflation a bit too lively at 6.1% in February. Good news might be on the horizon, though, as experts think earnings growth might cool off a touch to 5.5% in the three months to February, a slight dip from 5.6% in the previous period. This could give policymakers a bit of breathing room. Is the UK Economy Doing a Slow Dance? Let’s talk GDP. The UK’s GDP nudged up by just 0.1% in February, says the Office for National Statistics. It’s a tiny bump, but it’s in line with what folks were expecting. This number comes after a bit of a slump in the last half of 2023, where the economy shrank, slipping the UK into a technical recession. But there was a small win in January with a growth revision up to 0.3%. Not everything’s looking up though—construction output wasn’t doing too hot, dropping 1.9% in February. On the flip side, production output was the star of the show, climbing 1.1% in the same month, but growth in the big-shot services sector barely moved from 0.3% to 0.1%. Some economists are not all that optimistic about a strong bounce back. They think it might not be enough to keep inflation and interest rates from tumbling down like what’s happening over in the U.S. In fact, British inflation took a bigger dive than folks expected in March, hitting a near 2½-year low of 3.4%. But over in the U.S., prices climbed higher than expected at 3.5% this week, making some rethink when those interest rate cuts might start—pushing guesses from summer to September. And this has got some wondering if what’s happening with the Federal Reserve will make other central banks, including the Bank of England, pump the brakes on any early rate cuts, especially if the U.S. dollar starts flexing. Goldman Sachs even tweaked their forecast last Friday, dropping their prediction of Bank of England rate cuts from five down to four for the year, seeing them starting in June and then maybe easing into a quarterly rhythm. Simon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, chatted on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe,” pointing out that the Bank of England likes its independence but can’t ignore the upcoming UK national election hinted for later this year. The heat’s on, especially with some talk from the governing party expecting rate cuts soon. He said this could push the Bank to get those rate cuts out of the way before voters hit the polls. French wrapped it up by noting the numbers show the recession might be done, but it’s not exactly time to throw a party. The UK’s growth is still limping behind its pre-pandemic pace and lagging the U.S., but it’s keeping up with much of Europe and showing some spunk in areas like manufacturing and car production.","category":["Economy","News","Inflation","UK economy"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e18c","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"How did Satoshi Think of Bitcoin?","author":"Unchained","creation_date":"2024-04-13T21:00:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Njc3ODkxMjgxNzU3NzI1/bm-x-unchained---how-did-satoshi-think-of-bitcoin----article-preview.png","article_summary":"Unchained CSO Dhruv Bansal explores the principles and history that led to Bitcoin's creation and asks the question: \"what hath Satoshi wrought\"?","article_detailed_content":"The following is an essay originally published on Unchained.com by Dhruv Bansal, CSO and Co-founder of Unchained, the Official US Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine.

Click here to download a PDF of this 7,000 word essay on the origins of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is often compared to the internet in the 1990s, but I believe the better analogy is to the telegraph in the 1840s.[1] The telegraph was the first technology to transmit encoded data at near-light speed over long distances. It marked the birth of the telecommunications industry. The internet, though it is bigger in scale, richer in content, and manyto-many instead of one-to-one, is fundamentally still a telecommunications technology. Both the telegraph and the internet rely upon business models in which companies deploy capital to build a physical network and then charge users to send messages through this network. AT&T’s network has historically transmitted telegrams, telephone calls, TCP/IP packets, text messages, and now TikToks. The transformation of society through telecom has led to greater freedoms but also greater centralization. The internet has increased the reach of millions of content creators and small businesses, but has also strengthened the grasp of companies, governments and other institutions well-positioned enough to monitor and manipulate online activity. But bitcoin is not the end of any transformation— it’s the beginning of one. Like telecommunications, bitcoin will change both human society and daily life. Predicting the full scope of this change today is akin to imagining the internet while living in the era of the telegraph. This series attempts to imagine this future by starting with the past. This initial article traces the history of digital currencies before bitcoin. Only by understanding where prior projects fell short can we perceive what makes bitcoin succeed—and how it suggests a methodology for building the decentralized systems of the future. Outline I. Decentralized systems are markets II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods III. How can decentralized systems price computations? IV. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin V. Conclusion A central claim of this article is that bitcoin can be thought of as an adaptation of Dai’s b-money project that eliminates the freedom to create money. Just weeks after this article was originally published, new emails surfaced in which Satoshi claimed to be unfamiliar with b-money, yet admitted that bitcoin starts “from exactly that point.” In light of this new evidence, we believe this central claim, while not historically accurate, is still a meaningful and helpful way to think about the origin of bitcoin.

Satoshi was brilliant, but bitcoin didn’t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin iterated on existing work in cryptography, distributed systems, economics, and political philosophy. The concept of proof-of-work existed long before its use in money and prior cypherpunks such as Nick Szabo, Wei Dai, & Hal Finney anticipated and influenced the design of bitcoin with projects such as bit gold, b-money, and RPOW. Consider that, by 2008, when Satoshi wrote the bitcoin white paper,[2] many of the ideas important to bitcoin had already been proposed and/or implemented: Digital currencies should be P2P networks Proof-of-work is the basis of money creation Money is created through an auction Public key cryptography is used to define ownership & transfer of coins Transactions are batched into blocks Blocks are chained together through proof-of-work All blocks are stored by all participants Bitcoin leverages all these concepts, but Satoshi didn’t originate any of them. To better understand Satoshi’s contribution, we should determine which principles of bitcoin are missing from the list. Some obvious candidates are the finite supply of bitcoin, Nakamoto consensus, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm. But what led Satoshi to these ideas in the first place? This article explores the history of digital currencies and makes the case that Satoshi’s focus on sound monetary policy is what led bitcoin to surmount challenges that defeated prior projects such as bit gold and b-money. I. Decentralized systems are markets Bitcoin is often described as a decentralized or distributed system. Unfortunately, the words “decentralized” and “distributed” are frequently confused. When applied to digital systems, both terms refer to ways a monolithic application can be decomposed into a network of communicating pieces. For our purposes, the major difference between decentralized and distributed systems is not the topology of their network diagrams, but the way they enforce rules. We take some time in the following section to compare distributed and decentralized systems and motivate the idea that robust decentralized systems are markets. Distributed systems rely upon central authorities In this work, we take “distributed” to mean any system that has been broken up into many parts (often referred to as “nodes”) which must communicate, typically over a network. Software engineers have grown adept at building globally distributed systems. The internet is composed of distributed systems collectively containing billions of nodes. We each have a node in our pocket that both participates in and relies upon these systems. But almost all the distributed systems we use today are governed by some central authority, typically a system administrator, company, or government that is mutually trusted by all nodes in the system. Central authorities ensure all nodes adhere to the system s rules and remove, repair, or punish nodes that fail to do so. They are trusted to provide coordination, resolve conflicts, and allocate shared resources. Over time, central authorities manage changes to the system, upgrading it or adding features, and ensuring that participating nodes comply with the changes. The benefits a distributed system gains from relying upon a central authority come with costs. While the system is robust against failures of its nodes, a failure of its central authority may cause it to stop functioning overall. The ability for the central authority to unilaterally make decisions means that subverting or eliminating the central authority is sufficient to control or destroy the entire system. Despite these trade-offs, if there is a requirement that a single party or coalition must retain central authority, or if the participants within the system are content with relying upon a central authority, then a traditional distributed system is the best solution. No blockchain, token, or similar decentralized dressing is required. In particular, the case of a VC- or government-backed cryptocurrency, with requirements that a single party can monitor or restrict payments and freeze accounts, is the perfect use case for a traditional distributed system. Decentralized systems have no central authorities We take “decentralized” to have a stronger meaning than “distributed”: decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems that lack any central authority. A close synonym for “decentralized” is “peer-to-peer” (P2P). Removing central authority confers several advantages. Decentralized systems: Grow quickly because they lack barriers to entry—anyone can grow the system by simply running a new node, and there is no requirement for registration or approval from the central authority. Are robust because there is no central authority whose failure can compromise the functioning of the system. All nodes are the same, so failures are local and the network routes around damage. Are difficult to capture, regulate, tax, or surveil because they lack centralized points of control for governments to subvert. These strengths are why Satoshi chose a decentralized, peer-to-peer design for bitcoin: \"Governments are good at cutting off the heads of… centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.\" - Nakamoto, 2008 But these strengths come with corresponding weaknesses. Decentralized systems can be less efficient as each node must additionally bear responsibilities for coordination previously assumed by the central authority. Decentralized systems are also plagued by scammy, adversarial behavior. Despite Satoshi’s nod to Gnutella, anyone who’s used a P2P file sharing program to download a file that turned out to be something gross or malicious understands the reasons that P2P file sharing never became the mainstream model for data transfer online. Satoshi didn’t name it explicitly, but email is another decentralized system that has evaded government controls. And email is similarly notorious for spam. Decentralized systems are governed through incentives The root problem, in all of these cases, is that adversarial behavior (seeding bad files, sending spam emails) is not punished, and cooperative behavior (seeding good files, only sending useful emails) is not rewarded. Decentralized systems that rely upon their participants to be good actors fail to scale because they cannot prevent bad actors from also participating. Without imposing a central authority, the only way to solve this problem is to use economic incentives. Good actors, by definition, play by the rules because they’re inherently motivated to do so. Bad actors are, by definition, selfish and adversarial, but proper economic incentives can redirect their bad behavior towards the common good. Decentralized systems that scale do so by ensuring that cooperative behavior is profitable and adversarial behavior is costly. The best way to implement robust decentralized services is to create markets where all actors, both good and bad, are paid to provide that service. The lack of barriers to entry for buyers and sellers in a decentralized market encourages scale and efficiency. If the market’s protocols can protect participants from fraud, theft, and abuse, then bad actors will find it more profitable to either play by the rules or go attack a different system. II. Decentralized markets require decentralized goods But markets are complex. They must provide buyers and sellers the ability to post bids & asks as well as discover, match and settle orders. They must be fair, provide strong consistency, and maintain availability despite periods of volatility. Global markets today are extremely capable and sophisticated, but using traditional goods and payment networks to implement incentives in a decentralized market is a nonstarter. Any coupling between a decentralized system and fiat money, traditional assets, or physical commodities would reintroduce dependencies on the central authorities that control payment processors, banks, & exchanges. Decentralized systems cannot transfer cash, look up the balance of a brokerage account, or determine the ownership of property. Traditional goods are completely illegible from within a decentralized system. The inverse is not true—traditional systems can interact with bitcoin as easily as any other actor (once they decide they want to). The boundary between traditional and decentralized systems is not an impassable wall, but a semi-permeable membrane. This means that decentralized systems cannot execute payments denominated in any traditional good. They cannot even determine the balances of fiat-dominated accounts or the ownership of real estate or physical goods. The entire traditional economy is completely illegible from within decentralized systems. Creating decentralized markets requires trading new kinds of decentralized goods which are legible and transferable within decentralized systems. Computation is the first decentralized good The first example of a “decentralized good” is a special class of computations first proposed in 1993 by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.[3] Because of deep connections between mathematics, physics, and computer science, these computations cost real-world energy and hardware resources—they cannot be faked. Since real-world resources are scarce, these computations are also scarce. The input for these computations can be any kind of data. The resulting output is a digital “proof” that the computations were performed on the given input data. Proofs contain a given “difficulty” which is (statistical) evidence of a given amount of computational work. Most importantly, the relationship between the input data, the proof, and the original computational work performed can be independently verified without appeal to any central authority. The idea of passing around some input data along with a digital proof as evidence of real-world computational work performed on that input is now called “proof-of-work”.[4] Proofs-of-work are, to use Nick Szabo’s phrase, “unforgeable costliness”. Because proofs-of-work are verifiable by anyone, they are economic resources that are legible to all participants in a decentralized system. Proofs-of-work turn computations on data into decentralized goods. Dwork & Naor proposed using computations to limit the abuse of a shared resource by forcing participants to provide proofsof-work with a certain minimum difficulty before they can access the resource: \"In this paper we suggest a computational approach to combatting the proliferation of electronic mail. More generally, we have designed an access control mechanism that can be used whenever it is desirable to restrain, but not prohibit, access to a resource.\" - Dwoak & Naor, 1993 In Dwork & Naor’s proposal, an email system administrator would set a minimum proof-of-work difficulty for delivering email. Users wanting to send email would need to perform a corresponding number of computations with that email as the input data. The resulting proof would be submitted to the server alongside any request to deliver the email. Dwork & Naor referred to the difficulty of a proofof-work as a “pricing function” because, by adjusting the difficulty, a “pricing authority” could ensure that the shared resource remained cheap to use for honest, average users but expensive for users seeking to exploit it. In the email delivery market, server administrators are the pricing authorities; they must choose a “price” for email delivery which is low enough for normal usage but too high for spam. Though Dwork & Naor framed proofs-of-work as an economic disincentive to combat resource abuse, the nomenclature “pricing function” and “pricing authority” supports a different, marketbased interpretation: users are purchasing access to a resource in exchange for computations at a price set by the resource’s controller. In this interpretation, an email delivery network is really a decentralized market trading email delivery for computations. The minimum difficulty of a proof-of-work is the asking price for email delivery denominated in the currency of computations. Currency is the second decentralized good But computations aren’t a good currency. The proofs used to “trade” computations are only valid for the input used in those computations. This unbreakable lilnk between a specific proof and a specific input means that the proof-of-work for one input can’t be reused for a different input. Proof-of-work was originally proposed as an access control mechanism for limiting spam emails. Users would be expected to provide proofs-of-work alongside any emails they wanted to send. This mechanism can also be thought of as a market where users are purchasing email deliveries with computations at a price chosen by the email service provider. This constraint is useful – it can be used to prevent the work done by one buyer in the market from being re-spent by another. For example, HashCash, the first real implementation of the market for email delivery, included metadata such as the current timestamp and the sender’s email address in the input data to its proof-of-work computations. Proofs produced by a given user for a given email can’t be respent for sending a different email. But this also means that proof-of-work computations are bespoke goods. They aren’t fungible, they can’t be re-spent,[5] and they don’t solve the coincidence-of-wants problem. These missing monetary properties prevent computations from being currency. Despite the name, there is no incentive for an email delivery provider to want to accumulate HashCash, as there would be for actual cash. Adam Back, inventor of HashCash, understood these problems: \"hashcash is not directly transferable because to make it distributed, each service provider accepts payment only in cash created for them. You could perhaps setup a digicash style mint (with chaumian ecash) and have the bank only mint cash on receipt of hash collisions addressed to it. However this means you've got to trust the bank not to mint unlimited amounts of money for it's own use.\" - Adam Back, 1997 We don’t want to exchange bespoke computations for every individual good or service sold in a decentralized economy. We want a general purpose digital currency that can directly be used to coordinate exchanges of value in any market. Building a functioning digital currency while remaining decentralized is a significant challenge. A currency requires fungible units of equal value that can be transferred among users. This requires issuance models, cryptographic definitions of ownership and transfer, a discovery and settlement process for transactions, and a historical ledger. None of this infrastructure is required when proof-of-work is thought of as a mere “access control mechanism”. Moreover, decentralized systems are markets, so all these basic functions of a currency must somehow be provided through paying service providers…in the units of the currency that’s being created! Like compiling the first compiler, a black start of the electrical grid, or the evolution of life itself, the creators of digital currencies were confronted with a bootstrapping problem: how to define the economic incentives that underlie a functioning currency without having a functioning currency in which to denominate or pay those incentives. Computations and currency are the first and second goods in decentralized markets. Proof-of-work alone allows for the exchange of computations but a functioning currency requires more infrastructure. It took 15 years for the cypherpunk community to develop that infrastructure. The first decentralized market must trade computations for currency Progress on this bootstrapping problem comes from properly framing its constraints. Decentralized systems must be markets. Markets consist of buyers and sellers exchanging goods. The decentralized market for a digital currency only has two goods that are legible within it: Computations through proof-of-work Units of the currency we’re trying to build The only market trade possible must therefore be between these two goods. Computations must be sold for units of currency orF equivalentlyF units of currency must be sold for computations. Stating this is easy—the hard part is structuring this market so that simply exchanging currency for computation bootstraps all the capabilities of the currency itself! The entire history of digital currencies culminating in Satoshi’s 2008 white paperF was a series of increasingly sophisticated attempts at structuring this market. The following section reviews projects such as Nick Szabo’s bit gold and Wei Dai’s b-money. Understanding how these projects structured their marketsF and why they failed will help us frame why Satoshi and bitcoin succeeded. III. How can decentralized systems price computations? A major function of markets is price discovery. A market trading computations for currency must therefore discover the price of computation itself, as denominated in units of that currency. We don’t typically assign monetary value to computations. We typically value the capacity to perform computations because we value the output of computations, not the computations themselves. If the same output can be performed more efficiently, with fewer computations, that is usually called “progress”. Proofs-of-work represent specific computations whose only output is proof that they were performed. Producing the same proof by performing fewer computations and less work wouldn’t be progress—it would be a bug. The computations associated with proofs-of-work are thus a strange and novel good to attempt to value. When proofs-of-work are thought of as disincentives against resource abuse, it is not necessary to value them precisely or consistently. All that matters is that the email service provider sets difficulties low enough to be unnoticeable for legitimate users yet high enough to be prohibitive for spammers. There is thus a broad range of acceptable “prices” and each participant acts as their own pricing authority, applying a local pricing function. But units of a currency are meant to be fungible, each having the same value. Due to changes in technology over time, two units of currency created with the same proof-of-work difficulty— as measured by the number of corresponding computations—may have radically different realworld costs of production, as measured by the time, energy, and/or capital to perform those computations . When computations are sold for currency, and the underlying cost of production is variable, how can the market ensure a consistent price? Nick Szabo clearly identified this pricing problem when describing bit gold: \"The main problem…is that proof of work schemes depend on computer architecture, not just an abstract mathematics based on an abstract \"compute cycle.\" …Thus, it might be possible to be a very low cost producer (by several orders of magnitude) and swamp the market with bit gold.\" - Szabo, 2005 A decentralized currency created through proof-of-work will experience supply gluts and crashes as the supply of computations changes over time. To accommodate this volatility, the network must learn to dynamically price computations. Early digital currencies attempted to price computations by attempting to collectively measure the “cost of computing”. Wei Dai, for example, proposes the following hand-wavy solution in b-money: 'The number of monetary units created is equal to the cost of the computing effort in terms of a standard basket of commodities. For example if a problem takes 100 hours to solve on the computer that solves it most economically, and it takes 3 standard baskets to purchase 100 hours of computing time on that computer on the open market, then upon the broadcast of the solution to that problem everyone credits the broadcaster's account by 3 units.\" - Dai, 1998 Unfortunately, Dai does not explain how users in a supposedly decentralized system are supposed to agree upon the definition of a “standard basket”, which computer solves a given problem “most economically”, or the cost of computation on the “open market”. Achieving consensus among all users about a time-varying shared dataset is the essential problem of decentralized systems! To be fair to Dai, he realized this: \"One of the more problematic parts in the b-money protocol is money creation. This part of the protocol requires that all [users] decide and agree on the cost of particular computations. Unfortunately because computing technology tends to advance rapidly and not always publicly, this information may be unavailable, inaccurate, or outdated, all of which would cause serious problems for the protocol.\" - Dai, 1998 Dai would go on to propose a more sophisticated auction-based pricing mechanism which Satoshi would later say was the starting point for his ideas. We will return to this auction scheme below, but first let’s turn to bit gold, and consider Szabo’s insights into the problem. Use external markets Szabo claims that proofs-of-work should be “securely timestamped”: \"The proof of work is securely timestamped. This should work in a distributed fashion, with several different timestamp services so that no particular timestamp service need be substantially relied on.\" - Szabo, 2005 Szabo links to a page of resources on secure timestamping protocols but does not describe any specific algorithm for secure timestamping. The phrases “securely” and “distributed fashion” are carrying a lot of weight here, hand-waving through the complexities of relying upon one (or many) “outside the system” services for timestamping.[6] The time a unit of digital currency was created is important because it links the computations performed to real-world production cost. Regardless of implementation fuzziness, Szabo was right—the time a proof-of-work was created is an important factor in pricing it because it is related to the cost of computation: \"…However, since bit gold is timestamped, the time created as well as the mathematical difficulty of the work can be automatically proven. From this, it can usually be inferred what the cost of producing during that time period was…\" - Szabo, 2005 \"Inferring” the cost of production is important because bit gold has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create bit gold by performing the appropriate computations. Without the ability to regulate issuance, bit gold is akin to a collectible: \"…Unlike fungible atoms of gold, but as with collector s items, a large supply during a given time period will drive down the value of those particular items. In this respect bit gold acts more like collector s items than like gold…\" - Szabo, 2005 Bit gold requires an additional, external process to create fungible units of currency: \"…[B]it gold will not be fungible based on a simple function of, for example, the length of the string. Instead, to create fungible units dealers will have to combine different-valued pieces of bit gold into larger units of approximately equal value. This is analogous to what many commodity dealers do today to make commodity markets possible. Trust is still distributed because the estimated values of such bundles can be independently verified by many other parties in a largely or entirely automated fashion.\" - Szabo, 2005 To paraphrase Szabo, “to assay the value of… bit gold, a dealer checks and verifies the difficulty, the input, and the timestamp”. The dealers defining “larger units of approximately equal value” are providing a similar pricing function as Dai’s “standard basket of commodities”. Fungible units are not created in bit gold when proofs-ofwork are produced, only later when those proofs are combined into larger “units of approximately equal value” by dealers in markets outside the network. To his credit, Szabo recognizes this flaw: \"…The potential for initially hidden supply gluts due to hidden innovations in machine architecture is a potential flaw in bit gold, or at least an imperfection which the initial auctions and ex post exchanges of bit gold will have to address.\" - Szabo, 2005 Again, despite not having arrived at (what we now know as) the solution, Szabo was pointing us at it: because the cost of computation changes over time, the network must respond to changes in the supply of computation by adjusting the price of money. Use internal markets Szabo’s dealers would have been an external market that defined the price of (bundles of) bit gold after its creation. Is it possible to implement this market within the system instead of outside it? Let’s return to Wei Dai and b-money. As mentioned earlier, Dai proposed an alternative auction-based model for the creation of bmoney. Satoshi’s design for bitcoin improves directly on bmoney’s auction model[7]: \"So I propose an alternative money creation subprotocol, in which [users]… instead decide and agree on the amount of b-money to be created each period, with the cost of creating that money determined by an auction. Each money creation period is divided up into four phases, as follows: Planning. The [users] compute and negotiate with each other to determine an optimal increase in the money supply for the next period. Whether or not the [network] can reach a consensus, they each broadcast their money creation quota and any macroeconomic calculations done to support the figures. Bidding. Anyone who wants to create b-money broadcasts a bid in the form of where x is the amount of b-money he wants to create, and y is an unsolved problem from a predetermined problem class. Each problem in this class should have a nominal cost (in MIPS-years say) which is publicly agreed on. Computation. After seeing the bids, the ones who placed bids in the bidding phase may now solve the problems in their bids and broadcast the solutions. Money creation. Money creation. Each [user] accepts the highest bids (among those who actually broadcasted solutions) in terms of nominal cost per unit of bmoney created and credits the bidders accounts accordingly.\" Dai, 1998 B-money makes significant strides towards the correct market structure for a digital currency. It attempts to eliminate Szabo’s external dealers and allow users to engage in price discovery by directly bidding against each other. But implementing Dai’s proposal as written would be challenging: In the “Planning” phase, users bear the burden of negotiating the “optimal increase in the money supply for the next period”. How “optimal” should be defined, how users should negotiate with each other, and how the results of such negotiations are shared is not described. Regardless of what was planned, the “Bidding” phase allows anyone to submit a “bid” to create b-money. The bids include both an amount of b-money to be created as well as a corresponding amount of proofof-work so each bid is a price, the number of computations for which a given bidder is willing to perform in order to buy a given amount of b-money. Once bids are submitted, the “computation” phase consists of bidders performing the proof-of-work they bid and broadcasting solutions. No mechanisms for matching bidders to solutions is provided. More problematically, it’s not clear how users should know that all bids have been submitted – when does the “Bidding” phase end and the “computation” phase begin? These problems recur in the “Money ]reation” phase. Because of the nature of proof-of-work, users can verify the proofs they receive in solutions are real. But how can users collectively agree on the set of “highest bids”? What if different users pick different such sets, either due to preference or network latency? Decentralized systems struggle to track data and make choices consistently, yet b-money requires tracking bids from many users and making consensus choices among them. This complexity prevented b-money from ever being implemented. The root of this complexity is Dai’s belief that the “optimal” rate at which b-money is created should fluctuate over time based on the “macroeconomic calculations” of its users. Like bit gold, b-money has no mechanism to limit the creation of money. Anyone can create units of b-money by broadcasting a bid and then doing the corresponding proof-of-work. Both Szabo and Dai proposed using a market exchanging digital currency for computations yet neither bit gold nor b-money defined a monetary policy to regulate the supply of currency within this market.

Satoshi’s monetary policy goals led to bitcoin In contrast, a sound monetary policy was one of Satoshi’s primary goals for the bitcoin project. In the very first mailing list post where bitcoin was announced, Satoshi wrote: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" - Satoshi, 2009 Satoshi would go on to describe other problems with fiat currencies such as risky fractional reserve banking, a lack of privacy, rampant theft & fraud, and the inability to make micropayments. But Satoshi started with the issue of debasement by central banks—with a concern about monetary policy. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to ultimately reach a finite circulating supply that cannot be diluted over time. The “optimal” rate of bitcoin creation, for Satoshi, should thus eventually be zero. This monetary policy goal, more than any other characteristic they personally (or collectively!) possessed, was the reason Satoshi “discovered” bitcoin, the blockchain, Nakamoto consensus, etc. —and not someone else. It’s the short answer to the question posed in the title of this article: Satoshi thought of bitcoin because they were focused on creating a digital currency with a finite supply. A finite supply of bitcoin is not only a monetary policy goal or a meme for bitcoiners to rally around. It’s the essential technical simplification that allowed Satoshi to build a functional digital currency while Dai’s b-money remained just a fascinating web post. Bitcoin is b-money with an additional requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Like many technical simplifications, constraining monetary policy enables progress by reducing scope. Let’s see how each of the phases of b-money creation is simplified by imposing this constraint. All 21M bitcoin already exist In b-money, each “money creation period” included a “Planning” phase, in which users were expected to share their “macroeconomic calculations” justifying the amount of b-money they wanted to create at that time. Satoshi’s monetary policy goals of a finite supply and zero tail emission were incompatible with the freedom granted by b-money to individual users to create money. The first step on the journey from bmoney to bitcoin was therefore to eliminate this freedom. Individual bitcoin users cannot create bitcoin. Only the bitcoin network can create bitcoin, and it did so exactly once, in 2009 when Satoshi launched the bitcoin project. Satoshi was able to replace the recurring “Planning” phases of b-money into a single, predetermined schedule on which the 21M bitcoin created in 2009 would be released into circulation. Users voluntarily endorse Satoshi’s monetary policy by downloading and running the Bitcoin Core software in which this monetary policy is hard-coded. This changes the semantics of bitcoin’s market for computations. The bitcoin being paid to miners is not newly issued; it’s newly released into circulation from an existing supply. This framing is crucially different from the naive claim that “bitcoin miners create bitcoin”. Bitcoin miners are not creating bitcoin, they’re buying it. Bitcoin isn’t valuable because “bitcoin are made from energy”—bitcoin’s value is demonstrated by being sold for energy. Let’s repeat it one more time: bitcoin isn’t created through proof-of-work, bitcoin is created through consensus. Satoshi’s design eliminates the requirement for ongoing “Planning” phases from b-money by doing all the planning up front. This allowed Satoshi to hard-code a sound monetary policy but also simplified the implementation of bitcoin. Bitcoin is priced through consensus This freedom granted to users to create money results in a corresponding burden for the bmoney network. During the “Bidding” phase the b-money network must collect and share money creation “bids” from many different users. Eliminating the freedom to create money relieves the bitcoin network of this burden. Since all 21M bitcoin already exist, the network doesn’t need to collect bids from users to create money, it merely has to sell bitcoin on Satoshi’s predetermined schedule. The bitcoin network thus offers a consensus asking price for the bitcoin it is selling in each block. This single price is calculated by each node independently using its copy of the blockchain. If nodes have consensus on the same blockchain (a point we will return to later) they will all offer an identical asking price at each block.[8] The first half of the consensus price calculation determines how many bitcoin to sell. This is fixed by Satoshi’s predetermined release schedule. All bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same amount for a given block: The second half of the consensus asking price is the number of computations the current subsidy is being sold for. Again, all bitcoin nodes in the network calculate the same value (we will revisit this difficulty calculation in the next section): Together, the network subsidy and difficulty define the current asking of bitcoin as denominated in computations. Because the blockchain is in consensus, this price is a consensus price. Users in b-money also were presumed to have a consensus “blockchain” containing the history of all transactions. But Dai never thought of the simple solution of a single consensus asking price for the creation of new b-money, determined solely by the data in that blockchain. Instead, Dai assumed that money creation must go on forever. Individual users would therefore need to be empowered to affect monetary policy – just as in fiat currencies. This perceived requirement led Dai to design a bidding system which prevented b-money from being implemented. This added complexity was removed by Satoshi’s requirement of a predetermined monetary policy. Time closes all spreads In the “Computation” phase of b-money, individual users would perform the computations they’d committed to in their prior bids. In bitcoin, the entire network is the seller – but who is the buyer? In the email delivery market, the buyers were individuals wanting to send emails. The pricing authority, the email service provider, would set a price that was considered cheap for individuals but expensive for spammers. But if the number of legitimate users increased, the price could still remain the same because the computing power of individual users would have remained the same. In b-money, each user who contributed a bid for money creation was supposed to subsequently perform the corresponding number of computations themselves. Each user was acting as their own pricing authority based on their knowledge of their own computing capabilities. The bitcoin network offers a single asking price in computations for the current bitcoin subsidy. But no individual miner who finds a block has performed this number of computations.[9] The individual miner’s winning block is proof that all miners collectively performed the required number of computations. The buyer of bitcoin is thus the global bitcoin mining industry. Having arrived at a consensus asking price, the bitcoin network will not change that price until more blocks are produced. These blocks must contain proofs-of-work at the current asking price. The mining industry therefore has no choice if it wants to “execute a trade” but to pay the current asking price in computations. The only variable the mining industry can control is how long it will take to produce the next block. Just as the bitcoin network offers a single asking price, the mining industry thus offers a single bid—the time it takes to produce the next block meeting the network’s current asking price. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. - Nakamoto, 2008 Satoshi is modestly describing the difficulty adjustment algorithm, often cited as one of the most original ideas in bitcoin’s implementation. This is true, but instead of focusing on the inventiveness of the solution, let’s instead focus on why solving the problem was so important to Satoshi in the first place. Projects such as bit gold and b-money didn’t need to constrain the rate in time of money creation because they didn’t have a fixed supply or a predetermined monetary policy. Periods of faster or slower money creation could be compensated for through other means, e.g. external dealers putting bit gold tokens into larger or smaller bundlers or b-money users changing their bids. But Satoshi’s monetary policy goals required bitcoin to have a predetermined rate at which bitcoin was to be released for circulation. Constraining the (statistical) rate at which blocks are produced over time is natural in bitcoin because the rate of block production is the rate at which the initial supply of bitcoin is being sold. Selling 21M bitcoin over 140 years is a different proposition than allowing it to be sold in 3 months. Moreover, bitcoin can actually implement this constraint because the blockchain is Szabo’s “secure timestamping protocol.” Satoshi describes bitcoin as first and foremost a “distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis,” and early implementations of the bitcoin source code use the world “timechain” rather than “blockchain” to describe the shared data structure that implements bitcoin’s proof-of-work market.[10] Unlike bit gold or b-money, tokens in bitcoin do not experience supply gluts. The bitcoin network uses the difficulty adjustment to change the price of money in response to changes in the supply of computations. Bitcoin’s difficulty readjustment algorithm leverages this capability. The consensus blockchain is used by participants to enumerate the historical bids made by the mining industry and readjust the difficulty in order to move closer to the target block time. A standing order creates consensus The chain of simplifications caused by demanding strong monetary policy extends to the “Money creation” phase of b-money. User-submitted bids in b-money suffer from “nothing at stake” problem. There is no mechanism to prevent users from submitting bids with a huge amount of b-money for very little work. This requires the network to both track which bids have been completed and only accept the “highest bids…in terms of nominal cost per unit of b-money created” in order to avoid such nuisance bids. Each b-money participant must track an entire order book worth of bids, match bids with their subsequent computations, and only settle such completed orders with the highest prices. This problem is an instance of the more general problem of consensus in decentralized systems, also known as the “Byzantine generals” or sometimes the “double-spend” problem in the context of digital currencies. Sharing an identical sequence of data among all participants is challenging inside an adversarial, decentralized network. Existing solutions to this problem – socalled “Byzantine-fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms”—require previous coordination among participants or a supermajority (>67%) of participants to not behave adversarially. Bitcoin doesn’t have to manage a large order book of bids because the bitcoin network offers a single consensus asking price. This means bitcoin nodes can accept the first (valid) block they see that meets the network’s current asking price— nuisance bids can easily be ignored and are a waste of a miner’s resources. Consensus pricing of computations allows the matching of buy/sell orders in bitcoin to be done eagerly, on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike b-money, this eager order matching means that bitcoin’s market has no phases—it operates continuously, with a new consensus price being calculated after each individual order is matched (block is found). To avoid forks caused by network latency or adversarial behavior, nodes must also follow the heaviest chain rule. This greedy order settling rule ensures that only the highest bids are accepted by the network. This combination eager-greedy algorithm, where nodes accept the first valid block they see and also follow the heaviest chain, is a novel BFT algorithm which rapidly converges on consensus about the sequence of blocks. Satoshi spends 25% of the bitcoin white paper demonstrating this claim.[11] We established in previous sections that bitcoin’s consensus asking price itself depends on the blockchain being in consensus. But it turns out that the existence of a single consensus asking price is what allows the market for computations to eagerly match orders, which is what leads to consensus in the first place! Moreover, this new “Nakamoto consensus” only requires 50% of participants to not be adversarial, a significant improvement on the prior state of the art. A cypherpunk like Satoshi made this theoretical computer science breakthrough, instead of a traditional academic or industry researcher, because of their narrow focus on implementing sound money, rather than a generic consensus algorithm for distributed computing. IV. Conclusion B-money was a powerful framework for building a digital currency but one that was incomplete because it lacked a monetary policy. Constraining b-money with a predetermined release schedule for bitcoins reduced scope and simplified implementation by eliminating the requirement to track and choose among user-submitted money creation bids. Preserving the temporal pace of Satoshi’s release schedule led to the difficulty adjustment algorithm and enabled Nakamoto consensus, widely recognized as one of the most innovative aspects of bitcoin’s implementation. There is a lot more to bitcoin’s design than the aspects discussed so far. We have focused this article on the “primary” market within bitcoin, the market which distributes the initial bitcoin supply into circulation. The next article in this series will explore the market for bitcoin transaction settlement and how it relates to the market for distributing the bitcoin supply. This relationship will suggest a methodology for how to build future markets for decentralized services on top of bitcoin.

In particular, Ryan Gentry, Will Cole and Stephen Hall met with me weekly to debate these ideas. I would not have been able to overcome countless false starts without their contributions and their support. Ryan also helped me begin talking about these ideas publicly in our Bitcoin 2021 talk. Afsheen Bigdeli, Allen Farrington, Joe Kelly, Gigi, Tuur Demeester, and Marty Bent, have all encouraged me over the years and provided valuable feedback. I must also apologize to Allen for turning out to be such a lousy collaborator. Finally, Michael Goldstein may be better known for his writing & memes, but I’d like to thank him for the archival work he does at the Nakamoto Institute to keep safe the history of digital currencies. Footnotes [1] The title of this series is taken from the first telegraph message in history, sent by Samuel Morse in 1844: “What hath God wrought?”. [2] Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, available: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf [3] Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail by Dwork and Naor available: https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf [4] Despite originating the idea, Dwork & Naor did not invent “proof-of-work”—that moniker was provided later in 1999 by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. [5] Hal Finney’s RPOW project was an attempt at creating transferable proofs-of-work but bitcoin doesn’t use this concept because it doesn't treat computations as currency. As we’ll see later when we examine bit gold and b-money, computations cannot be currency because the value of computations changes over time while units of currency must have equal value. Bitcoin is not computations, bitcoin is currency that is sold for computations. [6] At this juncture, some readers may believe me dismissive of the contributions of Dai or Szabo because they were inarticulate or hand-wavy on some points. My feelings are the exact opposite: Dai and Szabo were essentially right and the fact that they did not articulate every detail the way Satoshi subsequently did does not detract from their contributions. Rather, it should heighten our appreciation of them, as it reveals how challenging the advent of digital currency was, even for its best practitioners. [7] Dai’s b-money post is the very first reference in Satoshi’s white paper, available: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt [8]There are two simplifications being made here: a.

With XRP now sharply below its major moving averages, focus is turning to a test of a long-term uptrend. Indeed, the XRP price has followed an uptrend going all the way back to its early 2023 lows. Should this uptrend break, a short-term retest of support in the $0.43-46 area. Even a break under $0.40 could be on the cards. XRP price predictions would get very bearish if it broke below this long-term uptrend / Source: TradingView Of course, assuming the broader market is in a bullish phase, such a dip would probably be bought into. But whether a recovery to $1 is incoming remains difficult to predict. Ripple Labs maintains winning momentum in its lawsuit versus the SEC. A judge ruled last year that Ripple Labs’ sales of XRP didn’t necessarily constitute a security transaction. And Ripple Labs predicts that its winning momentum will encourage banks to begin using its XRP-powered global payments solution. That could substantially boost XRP’s adoption. That being said, concerns remain about XRP’s lack of decentralization. Moreover, many are concerned that XRP lacks a major use case, when compared to other major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The former is increasingly viewed as digital gold, while the latter two are fast-growing smart-contract blockchains and the homes of fast-growing decentralized finance and application ecosystems. Crypto Alternatives to Consider XRP investors would be right to be concerned about the cryptocurrency’s near-term price risks. Sometimes traders hunting quick gains often turn to the shitcoin markets, looking for a quick 10x. But these markets are full of scams and pump-and-dump schemes. A potentially much better way to make quick exponential gains in crypto is to invest in crypto presales. Up-and-coming web3 projects often sell their native token at a big discount to early investors to fund development. If crypto investors can identify project’s with a great use-case, vision and competent team, they may be able to flip their presale tokens for a big premium at a later date, assuming the project gains traction. But with so many presales vying for investor funds, it can be difficult to know where to look first.

If passed, McHenry’s bill would see stablecoins face regulatory oversight similar to that of the traditional finance sector. Meanwhile, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) are planning to unveil new stablecoin legislation that would “weed out bad actors while still promoting growth and innovation” as early as this week. According to a recent Forbes report, the upcoming legislation would allow federal and state depository institutions to become stablecoin issuers while non-depository institutions would be overseen by the federal government yet regulated at the state level. “The bill is a product of common sense compromise,” Gillibrand said, claiming it would “help drive innovation in the cryptocurrency landscape.” Lawmakers Face Pushback From Senator Elizabeth Warren Despite the strong push for stablecoin reform on Capitol Hill, not all U.S. lawmakers are thrilled by the idea.

Warren, who has built a staunch anti-crypto reputation, is still attempting to advance the “Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act” (DAAMLA) since she first proposed it in 2022. “If we are going to create new on ramps, increasing traffic, which is exactly what the House bill does, then we need a regulatory framework that will put the rules for Anti-Money Laundering in place so that we do not have more opportunities for Iran and terrorists and drug lords and human traffickers to make more money,” she said.

As the rewards for mining new blocks are slashed in half, miners must adapt their approaches to maintain profitability and network stability. In this article, we delve into the various strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event. What is Bitcoin halving? The Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, reducing the block rewards miners receive by 50%. This mechanism is programmed into the Bitcoin protocol to control the coin's supply and maintain its scarcity over time. With each halving, the rate at which new bitcoins are generated slows down, influencing miners' incentives and behaviors. Impact on the Bitcoin ecosystem The strategies employed by Bitcoin miners during the halving event have significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. They influence network security, hash rate distribution, and the overall supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. Strategies employed by Hiveon B2B miner's clients Ben Smith, СЕО Immersion BTC 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? As a self-mining farm the halving there is a balance of deploying new capital for new generation units or optimizing the older generation units through third-party firmwares. I have been thinking about this for a year now and I have tried all the major firmware out there. I came to a conclusion. That Hiveon is the best one and shows the best results. I found that I can achieve close to new generation ASIC efficiency by adding their firmware which will keep me profitable post halving. 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? The biggest difficulty post-halving will be the reduction in daily revenue. The Bitcoin price needs to rise to offset the price of energy and other overhead. I have confidence that the global hashrate will decrease over a short-term post halving which should make the miners that have the ability to stay on more profitable, by adding Hiveon helps me ensure I will be able to keep my units running profitably post-halving. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? I think bitcoiners are some of the most fruitful and out-of-the-box thinkers on Earth. We strive every day to become more efficient and this can mean in power terms or revenue terms. I’ve heard of guys reusing the heat to generate alternative sources of income. I have not taken that step yet but I do see Bitcoin mining being a secondary device for other industries in the future. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining is always difficult due to it being such a young industry. With the ever changing impact of global events on the energy market it creates a challenge for our industry as it is closely tied to the energy market. My hope is that global conflict gets resolved and we can go back to a more stable atmosphere not only for bitcoin mining but for the future of our children and grandchildren. 5. Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price When planning for Bitcoin mining operations I think in the past it was focused on how much hashrate a person can deploy. Now when planning on building an operation I think you should look at one thing and that’s how efficient can I be. Instead of racing to increase your hashrate if you focus on efficiency then you are preparing yourself for future changes in the industry. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving I think the market reaction to the halving is different than at any other time in Bitcoin history. When you turn on the traditional finance cable networks and you hear them discussing the halving you know we have made it. We have worked hard for mainstream adoption and it is now progressing with the ETFs. Sascha Grumbach, Founder & CEO Green Mining DAO 1. What are your thoughts on BTC miner's strategies during the halving? Bitcoin miners are strategically navigating the halving period by prioritizing the minimization of operational costs, leveraging tools like Hiveon to monitor and optimize their mining operations. In addition to focusing on efficiency, miners are diversifying revenue streams and carefully assessing the cost-to-efficiency ratio when acquiring new mining equipment. Recent surges in Bitcoin prices have prompted many miners to capitalize on selling some of their accumulated Bitcoin for financial gain. However, with anticipation of even higher prices in the future, some miners are adopting a \"hodling\" strategy, while others are cautious about overleveraging and are considering more frequent selling of Bitcoin to cover expenses, drawing from lessons learned during previous bull runs 2. What will be the difficulty of mining after halving? After the halving, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is anticipated to undergo fluctuations, initially experiencing a potential short drop in hash rate, possibly returning to levels below 70T. However, over the long term, experts project a continued steep increase in difficulty as the network adjusts to changes in miner activity and hash power. This adjustment mechanism ensures the stability and security of the Bitcoin network, but short-term variations are expected due to factors such as fluctuations in mining profitability and changes in the overall network hashrate. 3. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income? Absolutely, revenue diversification and alternative income streams are not just opportunities but necessities in light of the escalating competition within the mining industry, where pure mining alone may become less profitable over time. Embracing a circular model presents a significant opportunity, wherein byproducts of mining operations, such as excess heat, can be repurposed for innovative products like our Bitcoin Mango. For instance, we're utilizing excess heat from Bitcoin miners to dry fruits, showcasing the potential for creative solutions that generate additional revenue streams. Furthermore, initiatives like grid build-out and net metering will become increasingly vital as global energy demands rise, offering avenues for monetization and sustainability in parallel with our core mining activities. This holistic approach not only bolsters profitability but also aligns with broader societal and environmental imperatives. 4. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Forecasting changes in mining economics indicates a prolonged period of challenges, as evidenced by the consistently low hash price index for over a year. Moreover, there's a possibility of further decline in this index, indicating heightened pressure on profitability within the mining sector. Despite these challenges, electricity costs remain the primary expense for miners, underscoring the critical importance of optimizing energy efficiency to maintain competitiveness. Successfully addressing this aspect will be pivotal for miners seeking to navigate the evolving landscape and emerge as winners in the increasingly competitive environment. 5. Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving In preparation for the upcoming halving and beyond, we are diligently planning the expansion and modernization of our mining capacities. Our strategy involves a steady upgrade of our mining fleet, ensuring that we stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Additionally, we are actively engaged in projects aimed at consistently increasing our hash rate, irrespective of the halving event. By maintaining a focus on continuous improvement and innovation, we are positioning ourselves to thrive in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining, maximizing our efficiency and competitiveness for long-term success. 6. Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving is a complex endeavor, especially given the current volatility in the market. Unlike previous cycles, where increases before the halving were noticeable but not as drastic, the current environment is experiencing unprecedented shifts. Factors such as the FTX scam potentially hindering a true bull market last cycle and the recent launch of ETFs with significant inflows have introduced new variables that could fundamentally alter market dynamics. This disruption challenges conventional wisdom regarding Bitcoin cycles and its value development as a scarce asset with widespread exposure. With ETFs buying substantial amounts of Bitcoin daily while the production rate dwindles, the math suggests a scenario where sharp price increases become inevitable to maintain equilibrium. In essence, the landscape may be on the brink of significant transformation, defying previous expectations and reshaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin's market. This discrepancy between ETF demand (currently 900 BTC mined) and diminishing supply (450 mined per day post-halving) underscores the necessity for market participants to closely monitor and adapt to these evolving dynamics to navigate potential opportunities and risks effectively. Thoughts, and answers from Hiveon CEO James Jewell Analysis of BTC miner's strategies during the halving Efficiency is Key: Miners should ensure their operations are as efficient as possible. This includes using the most updated and energy-efficient hardware, optimizing energy usage, and considering the cost-to-efficiency ratio when investing in new equipment. Our Hiveon Enterprise OS allows operators to maximize all of the above by creating a cohesive site ecosystem. Strategic Planning: Miners should plan for the long term. This includes anticipating future halving events, market conditions, and technological advances. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Miners should consider diversifying their income sources to offset potential revenue losses from reduced block rewards. This could include offering mining services or participating in staking protocols. Adapt and Evaluate: Miners should be prepared to continuously adapt and evaluate their strategies based on current market conditions and network difficulty. This includes being ready to adjust mining activities and timing strategies to optimize rewards. Collaborative Mining: Joining mining pools to combine computational power can increase the chances of successfully mining blocks and earning a share of the rewards. Leverage Mining Solutions: Miners should consider leveraging solutions like Hiveon which can help optimize mining processes, improve efficiency, and ultimately, maintain profitability post-halving. What is the difficulty of mining after halving? The difficulty of mining Bitcoin, or any other proof-of-work cryptocurrency, is a dynamic parameter that adjusts approximately every two weeks (2016 blocks) to maintain a constant block time, typically around 10 minutes per block. The difficulty adjusts based on the total computational power (hash rate) of the network. After a halving event, such as the Bitcoin halving which occurs approximately every four years, the block reward for miners is reduced by half. This reduction in block rewards can potentially affect miner profitability, leading to changes in miner behavior and hash rate. The difficulty adjustment mechanism ensures that blocks continue to be produced at a consistent rate despite fluctuations in hash rate. If a significant number of miners leave the network due to reduced profitability after a halving, the difficulty will adjust downwards to make mining easier and vice versa. Therefore, the difficulty of mining after a halving event is determined by the interplay of miner participation, hash rate changes, and the dynamic adjustment mechanism built into the protocol. It's worth noting that while halvings can impact miner profitability and hash rate, the difficulty adjustment mechanism is designed to maintain network security and stability over the long term. Do you foresee any opportunities for revenue diversification or alternative income streams to offset the impact of reduced block rewards? Bitcoin miners can explore various strategies to diversify their revenue streams and mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards from halving events. Some potential opportunities for revenue diversification include: Mining Altcoins: While Bitcoin mining may become less profitable after a halving due to reduced block rewards, miners can shift their computational power to mine alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that may offer more favorable mining economics. Altcoins with lower difficulty levels or emerging consensus mechanisms may present opportunities for miners to generate additional revenue. Mining Pools and Services: Mining pools can offer additional services beyond traditional block mining, such as transaction processing, blockchain analytics, and consultancy services. By diversifying their offerings, mining pools can generate additional revenue streams and attract a broader range of clients, including institutional investors and blockchain projects. Hardware Sales and Leasing: Mining hardware manufacturers can generate revenue by selling or leasing mining equipment to other miners or cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Additionally, they can offer maintenance services, hosting solutions, and consultancy services to support miners in optimizing their mining operations. Staking and Masternodes: Some cryptocurrencies utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) or masternode consensus mechanisms instead of proof-of-work (PoW) mining. Miners can diversify their revenue streams by participating in staking or operating masternodes for these cryptocurrencies, earning rewards in the form of staking rewards or transaction fees. Blockchain Development and Consulting: Miners with expertise in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency mining can offer development and consulting services to blockchain projects, enterprises, and governments. These services may include smart contract development, protocol upgrades, security audits, and regulatory compliance consulting. Cryptocurrency Trading and Investments: Miners can allocate a portion of their mining proceeds to cryptocurrency trading and investments, taking advantage of market opportunities to generate additional returns. However, this approach carries inherent risks and requires careful risk management and investment strategies. Energy Trading and Grid Services: Miners with access to surplus energy resources, such as renewable energy sources or excess capacity from energy-intensive industries, can explore opportunities to monetize their energy assets through energy trading, grid services, and demand response programs. Overall, miners can diversify their revenue streams by leveraging their expertise, infrastructure, and network resources to tap into various opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and energy markets. Diversification can help miners navigate market fluctuations, regulatory challenges, and technological advancements while maximizing their revenue potential. Forecasting changes in mining economics (costs, profitability, break even point) Scenario planning for mining operations based on projected difficulty and Bitcoin price Case study: Adaptation of major mining farms to previous halvings Planning the expansion and modernization of mining capacities in light of the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to the upcoming halving Predicting market reactions to events like the halving in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is problematic due to the complexity of various factors influencing market behavior. However, based on historical trends and general market dynamics, we can make some educated guesses about potential reactions: Price Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price volatility around halving events. The anticipation leading up to the halving often drives up demand, which can result in a price increase. However, once the event occurs and the expected supply reduction takes effect, there may be a period of price consolidation or even a temporary decline as market participants reassess the new supply-demand dynamics. Speculative Activity: Halving events tend to attract significant speculative activity as traders and investors try to capitalize on price movements. This can exacerbate price volatility, leading to rapid fluctuations in both directions. Market Sentiment: Sentiment plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency markets. Positive sentiment leading up to the halving, driven by expectations of reduced inflation and increased scarcity, can contribute to upward price momentum. Conversely, negative sentiment or concerns about the event's impact on mining profitability could lead to price declines. Miner Behavior: The halving directly affects Bitcoin miners by reducing their block rewards. Miners may respond to this reduction in revenue by adjusting their operations, potentially leading to changes in hash rate and network security. Any significant shifts in miner behavior could impact market sentiment and price dynamics. Macro-Economic Factors: External factors such as global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and geopolitical events can also influence cryptocurrency markets. While the halving itself is a supply-side event, broader market trends and macro-economic factors can shape investor sentiment and affect price movements. Long-Term Outlook: Despite short-term volatility, many Bitcoin proponents view the halving as a positive development for the cryptocurrency's long-term value proposition. The reduction in supply inflation reinforces Bitcoin's scarcity and its potential as a hedge against inflation, which could attract long-term investors and institutional interest. While it's challenging to predict the precise market reaction to the upcoming halving, understanding historical trends, market dynamics, and the broader eco-system can provide insights into potential outcomes. However, investors should approach cryptocurrency markets with caution, considering the high volatility and inherent risks involved. Given the upcoming (or recent) halving event, could you provide insights into how top BTC miners have adjusted their strategies to maintain profitability amidst the reduction in block rewards and increased competition? Efficiency Improvements: One common strategy for miners facing reduced block rewards is to improve the efficiency of their mining operations. This can involve upgrading to more energy-efficient mining hardware, optimizing mining software, and implementing better cooling solutions to reduce operational costs. Strategic Location and Energy Sourcing: Miners may strategically locate their operations in regions with access to cheap electricity, renewable energy sources, or government subsidies to lower their energy costs. By securing favorable energy contracts or negotiating partnerships with energy providers, miners can mitigate the impact of reduced block rewards on their profitability. Vertical Integration: Some miners vertically integrate their operations by investing in mining hardware manufacturing, hosting facilities, or energy production infrastructure. By controlling various aspects of the mining value chain, miners can optimize costs, increase operational efficiency, and capture additional revenue streams. Diversification of Revenue Streams: As mentioned earlier, miners can diversify their revenue streams by mining alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), offering mining-related services, participating in staking or masternode networks, or engaging in cryptocurrency trading and investments. Hedging Strategies: Miners may use financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, or derivatives to hedge against price volatility and revenue fluctuations. By locking in future revenue streams or mitigating downside risks, miners can protect their profitability in the face of uncertain market conditions. Community Engagement and Governance: Engaging with the Bitcoin community and participating in governance processes can help miners stay informed about protocol developments, network upgrades, and potential changes to mining incentives. By actively contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem and aligning their interests with those of the broader community, miners can secure their long-term profitability and sustainability. Overall, successful miners adopt a combination of these strategies to adapt to changes in the mining landscape, maintain profitability, and position themselves for long-term success in the evolving cryptocurrency market.

One of the simplest and most effective ways to improve your financial situation: Don’t get killed on taxes. Taxes are a major friction in most people’s financial lives, and a little foresight and planning can go a long way. This article will cover a few helpful tips and case studies that could help you improve your future tax planning. Let’s touch on a quick refresher. Keep these two foundational concepts in mind as you consider possible strategies. Cost basis: Keep detailed records of all your bitcoin transactions Maintaining meticulous records of every bitcoin transaction and its associated cost basis is not just a good practice but a crucial one, given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) authority to audit returns up to six years back. The answer is yes if you're wondering whether the IRS can track bitcoin transactions. The IRS employs various means to monitor bitcoin activities. Here's how: KYC Compliance: All major cryptocurrency exchanges must conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, ensuring that your identity is tied to your holdings. Transaction History: Many exchanges keep detailed records of the addresses associated with your withdrawals. This enables them to identify custodial wallets and track additional downstream transactions. Reporting to IRS: Numerous exchanges must submit 1099 forms to users and the IRS, providing a comprehensive overview of taxable events and gains. Legal Precedents: The IRS has successfully litigated cases against prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex, compelling them to disclose customer data. This legal standing solidifies the IRS's ability to access crucial information about bitcoin holdings and transactions. Given these measures, it is essential to recognize that the IRS is well-informed about bitcoin activities. Consequently, it is prudent to strategize your bitcoin tax plan accordingly. Many individuals venture into bitcoin investments without fully grasping the potential tax implications. Buying, selling, trading alternative coins, and switching exchanges may seem routine, but each event carries distinct tax implications. Neglecting these consequences can result in a complex situation during tax season. To navigate the intricacies of bitcoin taxation, it is imperative to establish and comprehend your cost basis. Taking the time to go back and organize your past transactions and maintaining clear, systematic records moving forward can streamline the tax reporting process, saving you time and mitigating potential issues. If you find the landscape of bitcoin taxes overwhelming, seeking guidance from a tax professional is a wise step to ensure that you are well-prepared and in compliance with tax obligations related to your bitcoin investments. Tax tables: Not all bitcoin is taxed the same The IRS treats bitcoin as property, not money, so it is subject to capital gains tax (not ordinary income tax) when sold, traded, or spent. Capital gains are taxed under two possible taxation tables: short-term and long-term capital gains. The following table helps visualize: Short-term gains on bitcoin held one year or less are taxed as ordinary income rates (green column). Refer to the yellow column if bitcoin is held for more than a year. Source: Sound Advisory If you hold bitcoin for over a year before disposing of it, you will pay long-term capital gains tax, which ranges from 0% to 20%, depending on your income. Furthermore, these tables only apply to non-qualified bitcoin—bitcoin not held in a retirement account. Qualified distributions from Traditional IRA bitcoin are always taxed as ordinary income (green), and Roth IRA distributions can be tax-free. With that as a backdrop, let’s get into some potential strategies that many bitcoiners often overlook. Strategies and Case Studies Bitcoin tax can snowball: Evaluate your cost-basis strategy Purchasing bitcoin is like freshly fallen snow - pure and untouched. It isn’t taxable. But you incur a taxable event when you set foot in that snow with a sell, trade, or spend. And similar to how a snowball grows as you roll it down a hill, the tax implications of your bitcoin transactions can accumulate over time. When accounting for transactions, it’s important to remember that each event will impact your cost basis. The IRS allows for “specific identification” accounting for bitcoin, where you keep track of every inventory item—in this case, every chunk of bitcoin. Specific identification has variations like FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out), and HIFO (highest-in, first-out) when matching dispositions (sells, trades, spends) with acquisitions (buys, income). With a good identification record, you can run projections to see which method gives you the lowest gains. Scenario: Adam bought 1 BTC in January 2023 for $16,000 and another 2 BTC in March 2023 for $48,000. He sold 1 BTC in August 2023, when 1 BTC is worth $30,000. With FIFO, Adam has a $14,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $16,000). With LIFO, Adam has a $6,000 capital gain (sale price of $30,000 less cost basis of $24,000). HIFO is the same as LIFO in this case. These would be short-term capital gains, so let’s assume a hypothetical 22% federal tax rate. Adam can pay $1,760 less tax by choosing LIFO over FIFO. It’s quite simple when there are only a few transactions, but it can easily become complicated with every additional buy, sell, or spend. Cost basis and the subsequent transaction matching is an evolving calculation that could have drastic consequences if done incorrectly. Tax loss harvesting Recently, bitcoin has been trading near its all-time highs. So, this strategy is less relevant, but we’ll leave it here for future readers. In a tax loss harvesting strategy, you can sell at a loss to offset other income or capital gains and lower your tax liability. If you have realized capital gains from selling bitcoin this year, look at coins you're still holding that are trading below their purchase price. Scenario: Hal has a $15,000 short-term gain from selling a stock before holding onto it for a year. In December, he decides to sell some bitcoin at a $12,000 loss. This offsets $12,000 of his stock gain, so he only needs to pay capital gains tax on the remaining $3,000 gain instead of $15,000. At a 22% tax rate, $2,640 is saved. Just because you had a loss this year doesn't mean you necessarily want to use that loss this year. You can look at using the tax loss carry forward technique. Up to $3,000 in annual losses can offset your other income (things like wages, rental income, etc.). However, any amount over $3,000 must be carried forward to be used in future years. Some strategic clients may decide to harvest and report losses now so you can reduce taxes and carry them forward to offset future gains. If attempting to harvest losses, please be aware of the wash sale rule, described in further detail at the end of this article. Tax gain harvesting: The 0% tax bracket A peculiar tax rate in the capital gains table above is 0.00% tax on long-term capital gains. For 2024, if total taxable income falls under $94,050 as a married couple ($47,025 single), you can sell long-term capital assets, and gains are taxed at 0% federally. Paying a 0% tax ain’t so bad. Sign me up. I’ll even pay it twice. And “taxable income” is calculated after the standard deduction, which adds another $29,200 for married ($14,600 single). Scenario: Let’s assume Stacey and Max are married with $100,000 combined in W2 income from their jobs at the embassy. They sell some bitcoin throughout the year and realize a $16,000 long-term capital gain. Some quick math: $100,000 (W2) plus $16,000 (cap gain) is $116,000. Take out the standard deduction of $29,200, and the taxable income is $86,800. Since their total taxable income for the year is below the $94,050 threshold, their bitcoin gains are taxed at 0% (tax-free). And we’ll assume that they live in one of the nine US states that don’t have an income tax, so let’s call it 0% state tax as well. It is possible to sell non-retirement bitcoin tax-free—valuable information for those looking to sell. If you are in a situation where you think these income levels/brackets may apply to you (now or in the future), a strategic sell and immediate rebuy opportunity awaits: the tax gain harvest. Sometimes, it makes sense to sell bitcoin, recognize a gain at 0% rates, and immediately buy it right back. By repurchasing the bitcoin immediately, you effectively set a new cost basis for your investment. This new basis is higher than your original purchase price. In the future, if bitcoin's value continues to rise and you decide to sell again, you'll be taxed on a smaller gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. Gains harvesting is: sell your bitcoin, take advantage of the 0% bracket, and buy it right back (wash sale rules only disallow losses - not gains). The desired outcome here is an increase in tax basis. In the future, you'll be taxed on a smaller future gain, thanks to the earlier gains harvesting. A prime opportunity for gains harvesting often comes during retirement. When people stop working, they typically stop receiving income from their jobs (say goodbye to those W2s!). This significant drop in income could place them in that coveted 0% tax bracket. With that extra room, they can maximize their tax strategies not just with gains harvesting but also with other income structuring strategies Roth IRA conversions or liquidating assets through installment sales. Gifting We’ll cover three target gift recipients: charitable organizations, donor-advised funds, and other people. Charity When you donate bitcoin to a qualifying charitable organization, you can deduct the full fair market value of the donation. This will allow you to avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation before gifting yet still get the write-off. Donating bitcoin directly rather than cash proceeds from selling it is more advantageous, as the latter would trigger capital gains tax. Just remember to obtain a receipt from the charity for your records and get a special valuation assessment if needed. Scenario: Jack bought 1 bitcoin in 2015 for $200. It's now worth $70,000. He donated 0.25 BTC to a charity this December and got a receipt showing its value of $17,500. Jack claims a $17,500 charitable deduction. If he had sold the bitcoin and given cash instead, he’d pay tax on $17,450 in capital gains. You can effectively give more value by gifting rather than selling and giving cash. “But I don’t want to have less bitcoin!” If bitcoin holders are familiar with “spend and replace,” we can consider a similar strategy like “donate and replace.” You can gift appreciated bitcoin and repurchase with cash to increase the cost basis (like the above example - gains harvesting), thus lowering future taxes. Donor-advised funds For regular or substantial contributors to charitable causes, a donor-advised fund (DAF) presents a mechanism for amplifying their philanthropy. Think of a DAF as a \"charitable savings account\": You make contributions with assets, secure an immediate tax benefit, and then, at your discretion, advise on investing those assets and distributing the grants to charities of your choice over time. Incorporating bitcoin into this structure introduces an exciting dynamic. Given its potential for significant appreciation, designating it as an asset within a DAF can exponentially magnify the fund's growth potential. The result? A larger reservoir of resources dedicated to driving positive change in the world, all while efficiently navigating tax implications. Friends and family Giving bitcoin to others transfers the original tax basis and gets bitcoin out of the estate. Instead of selling bitcoin and realizing gains, you can gift bitcoin up to the annual gift exclusion amount of $18,000 per person per recipient. The gift tax annual exclusion is the amount you may give each year to individuals and certain types of trusts tax-free without using any of your gift and estate tax exemption. As the giver, you do not owe taxes on gifts under the exclusion amount of $18,000. The recipient inherits your cost basis and will owe capital gains when they eventually sell (perhaps at a lower bracket/rate than you). Scenario: A married couple, the Nakamotos, want to give a significant amount of bitcoin to their daughter Kristina and her new husband. Annual exclusion amounts are $18,000 per person. Effectively, the Nakamotos can gift $72,000 without dipping into their “lifetime bucket.” Dad to Kristina. Dad to husband. Mom to Kristina. Mom to husband. $18,000 each. Roth accounts Using a Roth IRA can eliminate ALL future tax liability. If eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA or 401k allows for tax-free appreciation and distribution if held to age 59.5. Since Roth accounts provide tax-free growth, they are ideal for long-term bitcoin holdings. If you own bitcoin outside an IRA that you want to hold long term, you could sell the bitcoin, contribute the USD proceeds to the Roth IRA, and repurchase the bitcoin inside the Roth. This eliminates the bitcoin cost-basis tracking requirement and allows future appreciation to be tax-free upon qualified distribution. Conclusion The maximum contribution to an IRA in 2024 is $7,000 per person ($8,000 if over 50), and you have until April 2025 to make 2024 contributions. Consult your financial or tax advisor to see if this strategy suits you. With proper tax planning, bitcoin investors can maximize after-tax returns and minimize tax liability. Work closely with your tax professional to implement the right strategies based on your situation. Keep meticulous records and understand the nuances around cost basis, tax loss harvesting, retirement accounts, charitable gifting, and other techniques. The bitcoin tax rules can be complex, but the long-term rewards of proper planning are well worth the effort. A note on wash sales The wash sale rule prevents claiming a capital loss if you repurchase the same security within 30 days before or after the sale. This rule currently applies only to securities, not commodities like bitcoin. Some bitcoin investors have taken advantage of this loophole by selling at a loss and immediately repurchasing while claiming the capital loss to reduce their tax liability. This tax loss harvesting strategy is extremely risky and not recommended. Even though wash sales are not explicitly prohibited for bitcoin yet, the IRS could determine this pattern violates the essence of wash sale rules under the step transaction doctrine. Engaging in systematic wash sales to harvest losses could trigger penalties and interest if identified in an audit. It is safer to avoid wash sales of bitcoin, even though technically allowed now. Do not sell at a loss and reacquire the same bitcoin within 30 days before or after the sale. Consult a qualified tax advisor before attempting any tax strategies involving cryptocurrency. 1) Transferring bitcoin between your wallets is not taxable. Only transfers between separate parties are taxable events. 2) These rates only affect federal taxation. Capital gains are taxed in varying ways and rates at the state level. Please consult your tax professional regarding state taxation, as it may change the appropriate strategies and recommendations for your situation. CONTACT Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

They aren't being created, they're simply being unlocked.","article_detailed_content":"Most people who understand bitcoin know that there are two kinds of bitcoin. One is bitcoin, the asset which has a fixed supply and is quite volatile, and the second kind of Bitcoin, the network and protocol that maintains an immutable ledger that has never been hacked and is bullet proof, bomb proof and tank proof. It is my opinion that too much focus is placed on the asset and not nearly enough on the network, protocol and immutable ledger. While listening to a recent podcast Peter McCormack had with Dhruv Bansal they discussed the network and protocol in a new way. I really liked Dhruv’s framing of how to view the fixed supply of bitcoin. The two versions can be simplified as follows: Version 1: The Commonly Held View The 21 million will be issued across a 131 year period from 2009 until 2140. Not all bitcoin have been issued or created yet. This view holds that as of March 2024 there have been roughly 19,659,000 bitcoin issued or created which is 93.62% of the entire supply. In the current epoch, the way you’d describe this is “6.25 bitcoin are created roughly every ten minutes.” Version 2: Dhruv’s View ALL 21 million were created via the network, consensus mechanisms, algorithms and protocol on January 3, 2009 and as of that date its monetary policy and hence the supply issuance for those 21 million was fixed on that date. ALL 21,000,000 ALREADY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED OR UNLOCKED. Dhruv used the term “released” to signify how many bitcoin are issued every ten minutes. I will use the term “unlocked” for the balance of this article to further amplify the brilliance of Dhruv’s framing. Bitcoiners are already familiar with time locked bitcoin and in a sense Dhruv’s framing just extends the idea of time locked bitcoin to its logical conclusion. The time lock schedule for Epoch 1 ran for 210,000 blocks. The next time lock schedule for Epoch 2 ran for 210,000 blocks and so forth. Why is Dhruv’s framing important? By framing mining as buying coins rather than creating coins it helps us make sense of the constantly increasing difficulty. How do we protect this fixed supply of 21 million coins and prevent human cheating for 131 years? If miners are creating bitcoins, then it appears that they are using ever more resources to create ever fewer coins over time. This makes bitcoin seem like it suffers an \"inefficiency of scale\" -- as bitcoin adoption grows, more resources are used in mining, and the cost of bitcoin production *increases* instead of decreasing, as we would expect in any other industry. This is part of the reason (Dhruv suspects) why many people prima facie object to bitcoin mining -- it just seems dumb and wasteful that it works this way! Conversely, if we think of bitcoin miners as *purchasing* bitcoins from an existing supply [paid for in computations] then the increasing resources used by miners makes sense -- as bitcoin adoption grows, bitcoins become more valuable, the security of the network increases and the network adjusts the price of newly released bitcoins upward. Dhruv thinks this framing could help to alleviate some people's negative first impressions of the mining market. Note: The reason this framing makes sense is Satoshi created an entirely new way to tell time with distributed systems. I don’t think we give him/her/them nearly enough credit for this! As Gigi points out in Bitcoin Is Time, in the absence of a central authority Satoshi had to invent a new way for a group of decentralized computers to tell time. Satoshi chose ten minutes as the target block time and enforced it via an auction. Humans are deeply tied to time as we understood it before bitcoin so some of us will have a hard time seeing it as Dhruv suggests. The Bitcoin Base Layer Has Two Markets Dhruv posits there are two markets operating in Bitcoin AT ALL TIMES that make up the base layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero and Layer one. Layer zero is what I’d call the security layer and the monetary policy layer and it is enabled via math and code at an auction that occurs every block which takes on average 10 minutes. Every block since January 3, 2009 the Bitcoin network has held an auction that has a fixed asking price [measured in computations] that is selling the next tranche of bitcoin that already exist to the entire global bitcoin mining industry. An example of massive collaboration if ever there was one! Back when it was just Satoshi and Hal Finney there wasn’t a global bitcoin mining industry, but you get the gist. Today I think the global bitcoin mining industry is better and more accurately thought of as the Bitcoin network security layer, but that is a topic for another article. Dhruv points out that this is a “two sided auction where you get this many coins for this many computations.” The entire industry of bitcoin miners [timestamp servers] paid the computational price collectively for that block. There are this many coins [depending on the epoch] for this many computations and the network waits to unlock the next batch of coins until one fortunate miner comes in that meets that minimum computational price. There is a persistent guessing game using proof of work that goes on among all the time stamp servers who are plugged into the Bitcoin network. This is what gives the Bitcoin network such amazing security. Eventually one of these timestamp servers “wins the auction” using Dhruv’s framing and earns the block reward. Every time stamp server for that 10 minute period is serving the purpose of making the network extremely secure but only one time stamp server wins the block reward. Technically this one time stamp server is often operating in a mining pool but that does not matter for purposes of this article. If the network paid too many computations or too few then the TIME IT TOOK TO MEET THAT BID WAS DIFFERENT THAN 10 MINUTES. The network protocol and software tracks these 2016 auctions during this 2016 block span and makes note of the times for each block. He says, “Each of those times can be thought of itself as a bid. The entire industry is offering these bids in sequence and the network pauses and says ‘what were the most recent bids in time?’ and readjusts the price it pays the miners (the security force) so that the bidding time matches the target time.” The big idea is Bitcoin Layer zero is a market between the entire network of users and the entire network of bitcoin miners which forms the security layer for the network. This market acts as an energetic force field protecting the network every moment of every day since 2009. Why call it a market? Dhruv believes that all decentralized systems must be markets in order to work. [In this case Layer zero is a collective market that involves computations for the timed release or unlock of bitcoin. And, additionally this collective market provides security services for the timechain.] What Is The Core Trade On Layer Zero? What is the core trade on Layer zero? Bansal says “it’s computations for bitcoin.” Layer 0 is a “market between two aggregates.” It’s a market between the entire bitcoin network [who want security] and the entire bitcoin mining industry who want security and the block reward. There are only two “participants” in this layer. This market is closely related to another market [Layer 1] which is the market for block space. Bob Burnett has also been saying this in a different way by pointing out there are two kinds of scarcity in bitcoin. We can call Layer one the final settlement and transaction layer of Bitcoin. Layer zero solves the problem of how to release or unlock a fixed supply of currency fairly into circulation and secure the network until the year 2140 using proof of work. The Layer 1 market is how do I get transactions to achieve finality and change ownership on an immutable ledger? Each market has an artificial and purposeful constraint. Layer 0 is the fixed number of coins released or unlocked over 131 years. Layer 1 is the blocksize or block space. Layer 1 is a market between individuals. How much is the individual user willing to pay to include this transaction in a block? Occasionally there are blocks mined that have zero transactions in them. For those who think “how wasteful,\" think again. These blocks prove the value and existence of the security layer. Any blocks mined with zero transactions in it proves there is a Layer zero market and it ignores the Layer 1 market. [It also reinforces Dhruv’s point that there are two markets.] Over time as all bitcoin are released into circulation, the Layer zero market goes away. It is no longer needed. At that point, the only market remaining for the base layer will be Layer 1. Most bitcoiners believe the transaction fees alone will be sufficient to continue to secure the Bitcoin network long into the future. Conceptually the Layer one market will take over and secure the immutable ledger to be sure no one cheats. There are some who believe that transaction costs won’t provide enough incentive for miners to continue to mine, but there are two markets, and the first market Layer Zero is a long way from done. The incentives to mine are already very strong [there are something like 20 publicly traded companies] and these incentives are getting stronger every day. I know of many bitcoiners who currently run their miners for the heat it delivers and so they have a strong incentive to continue even after the Layer zero market has served its purpose. There are entrepreneurs looking to build businesses around these timestamp servers that will heat pools, heat hot water, heat rooms, heat homes and heat buildings and will provide electricity to people in the world who have none. In fact, I predict in the next few years there will be appliances built for the heat they produce. In addition, miners are in a constant world-wide search for places where there is free energy, stranded energy, wasted energy, methane mitigation and even waste tires they can use as a fuel source. There are also nation states that are mining bitcoin. Anyone with a significant amount of bitcoin will have plenty of incentive to keep mining so long as the value of the network continues to grow AND nation states keep devaluing their currency to zero. In addition, there is a new form of energy technology called OTEC that I suspect will become a breakthrough form of energy that will be proven workable near the equator because of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is a layer of markets. These first two markets run separately from each other. And there is a Layer 2 that has emerged and is still being built that delivers fast settlement and payments. Layer zero is the security layer and supply unlock layer. Layer 1 is the store of value layer and final settlement layer. Layer 2 is medium of exchange and fast settlement layer. For those who find these ideas foreign or hard to grasp feel free to ignore them or tell us where our gaps in thinking occur. Take solace in the idea that free markets and math secure your bitcoin [instead of central bankers] and will do so into the foreseeable future.

This is the first ever collection of Inscriptions that will evolve over time, and was created in a time of high fees and an unpredictable future fee market. This is not an article about the aesthetic virtues of the artwork (I think they look cool) or reasons to participate in the market for them; this is an article about the technical implementation of Quantum Cats. I think the engineering challenges we faced and the techniques we implemented to meet those challenges are interesting and potentially useful to both future Ordinals creators and to other Bitcoin application developers generally. Before getting into the technical nitty gritty of Quantum Cats, it’ll be useful to understand the experience we were trying to create. Ordinals users hold inscriptions (digital collectables that are implemented in the Ordinals protocol and are transferred with Bitcoin transaction) in self-custody Bitcoin wallets that have coin control and transaction construction features that allow for transfer of specific ordinals, as well as the signing of more complex transaction types (such as trustless offers and swaps on ordinals marketplaces). We wanted to create an Inscription collection that would evolve over time – adding or changing attributes or traits of the Cats. The artwork for Inscriptions is published on-chain in the witness of a Taproot transaction (in a special encoding called an Envelope – ordinals-aware software parse transactions looking for this envelope in order to find inscriptions). That means that any particular inscription data is immutable and can not be changed once it’s been published (short of a re-org). However, there are a couple different ways that we can deliver the experience of changing artwork, even though the artwork never actually changes (and in-fact, having access to the old artwork is great if you like it more!). Recursion is an ordinals feature where one inscription can reference the content of another. For example, you can inscribe an HTML page, and have it include images that are in other inscriptions. Ordinals software renders HTML pages in iframes, so you can have an ordinal’s content be built-up client side from multiple inscriptions. HTML inscriptions can not include content from the broader web, only from other inscriptions or a small set of other endpoints provided by the ordinals software (for example, there is an endpoint to fetch the current bitcoin block height). This means that recursive inscriptions are all still on-chain, they just are decomposed which allows for composability and re-use of common components. For example all the Quantum Cats with a red background can refer to a single inscription containing the red background, instead of all of them needing to put the same data on-chain. When one inscription refers to another, it does so by its Inscription ID. An Inscription ID is made up of the Bitcoin transaction ID in which the inscription data is revealed, the letter i and then an output index of the inscription that is created. For example, the inscription 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079i0 is the first inscription created in the bitcoin transaction 4b31771df21656d2a77e6fa18720a6dd94b04510b9065a7c67250d5c89ad2079. That means that if you inscribe an image (like a png) and then inscribe an HTML page that includes the inscription ID of the image in an img tag, you can have the HTML inscription render the content of the image inscription. If the HTML inscription refers to an image inscription that is not actually on-chain (yet), then the ordinals server will return a 404 (not found) error, which the HTML inscription can quietly swallow. If we pre-sign image inscriptions – but don’t broadcast them to the Bitcoin network – we can obtain their future inscription IDs (because they are just a transaction ID and an index), and include those inscription IDs in HTML inscriptions that we do broadcast. When someone views the HTML inscription, it is able to render the content of its references that are on-chain, but will not be able to render the presigned but not broadcasted components. As more components are published, the HTML inscription will automatically be able to render them. This is the core mechanism that the Quantum Cats collection uses to evolve its artwork – presigned transactions for traits that are progressively revealed over time. As we’ll see, fee management and market dynamics introduced complexities that made the Quantum Cats need some additional layers of indirection and features, but presigned transactions with pre-computed transaction IDs are the key feature of Bitcoin that made the collection possible. Even though the contents of a presigned but unrevealed inscription are unknown before the transaction is broadcast, the same inscription ID will have the same content. This created a problem: even though people can’t tell what a future trait would be (like a background or a body trait), they would be able to count the number of times that a particular inscription ID occurred and be able to tell which future traits were more-or-less rare, and be able to trade Cats on their future evolutions. We really wanted evolutions to be surprising and fun, and not knowing ahead of time what future evolutions would do to the relative rarity of different cats is a lot of fun. So, we introduced a layer of indirection: every cat refers to presigned (but unrevealed) “Layer Connector” that map a Cat by a unique ID to presigned artwork. That means for example that every Cat refers to the same Layer Connector for its initial background image. It is only once this Layer Connector is broadcast to the network that people can learn which backgrounds are more or less common. This technique also allowed for space-savings: since every cat refers to identical layer-connectors, the HTML for the cat to import the layer connectors can be inscribed once and then referred to by each of the 3333 Cat inscriptions. In fact, each Cat inscription was reduced down to 109 bytes: just a unique Cat ID and a script tag to import the logic to fetch and render the common set of Layer Connectors, look up the unique artwork for each layer by cat, and render that artwork. Being able to move the mapping of each Cat to its artwork out of the individual Cat inscriptions and into a common inscription, and adding the layer of presigned indirection not only solved the information leak about relative rarity in traits, but also saved approximately 5 BTC in inscription costs! With this introduction of Layer-Connector inscriptions and the factoring of rendering logic to a common component, there are now 4 kinds of assets being inscribed: Actual artwork for each trait in the Cat (a background image, or a body, or the eyes) A layer-connector that maps a Cat by its ID to a specific artwork asset. This mapping happens once per “layer” (background, body, eyes, mouth, etc.) The core dispatch and rendering logic. We call this the “Dispatcher”. It is responsible for fetching a layer connector, looking up the artwork for the Cat in the layer connector, fetching that artwork asset, and then rendering it to a canvas in order. This successive rendering in order is why we model the artwork as a layer. The individual Cat that is distributed to a collector. This is 109 bytes and includes a unique ID and a reference to the dispatcher, which contains all the rendering code In Quantum Cats, there are several hundred artwork assets, 40 layers (meaning 40 layer-connectors), 1 dispatcher, and 3333 cats. The 3333 Cat inscriptions refer to the inscription ID of the Dispatcher, which refers the the inscription IDs of the 40 layer-connectors, each of which refers to one or more inscription IDs of artwork assets. We presigned these assets in the reverse order: first the artwork to get their inscription IDs, then we rendered those into layer-connectors and presigned those to get their inscription IDs, then rendered the Dispatcher and presigned it, and then finally assembled the individual Cat inscriptions. Inscription IDs include a Bitcoin transaction ID. Bitcoin Transaction IDs are a function of their inputs, outputs, version, and locktime. That means that if we spend the UTXO that funds a presigned transaction on some other transaction, then we will never be able to re-create that same transaction ID again, and we will break our presigned inscription reference! To avoid this, we created a UTXO to fund every presigned transaction, and then maintained a database to track which UTXO was assigned to fund which presigned transaction. We also had automated sanity checks to assert that no two inscriptions spent the same UTXO, that every inscription commit transaction only spent its assigned UTXO, and that the total inputs and outputs of all transactions (including fees) were what we expected. These checks ran whenever the system touched wallets or keys, and gave us confidence that nothing was being signed that shouldn’t be. Additionally, we used segregated wallets for different asset inscription types, to add further protections against a bug causing a UTXO being double-assigned. We also built a test harness that ran through all of the presigning and publication of inscriptions on regtest and then validated that the data that ended up on-chain matched what was in our control-plane database. Presigning transactions in this way meant that we had to pre-commit to the fees that each inscription would pay. We can’t know what fee rates will be when we eventually reveal these evolutions, so what we decided to do is presign the transactions with a reasonable fee rate and then build tooling to bump the fees in the future if we presigned too low (if we presigned a fee higher than needed, we would just have to live with it, so part of the analysis here was picking a fee rate we were comfortable with even if it turned out we overpaid). Other than using a transaction accelerator service (paying a miner out of band to include a transaction in a block even if it pays below-market in fees), there are two techniques to increase the effective fee-rate of a transaction: Replace-by-fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP). RBF involves re-spending the inputs of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee. Because our application relies on pre-committed transaction IDs, this was not an option. CPFP involves spending the unconfirmed output of a transaction in a new transaction that pays a higher fee than the “parent”. In order for miners to capture the fees from this “child” transaction, they have to include both parent and the child as a package. The effective fee-rate ends up being the total fees paid divided by the total virtual size of the package (all the transactions together). Since the parent transaction is unperturbed, this was exactly the fee-bumping mechanism that we needed. One remaining wrinkle is that we had potentially hundreds of transactions that would need to be fee-bumped. In addition to the difficulty of accurately bumping 10’s or 100’s of unconfirmed transactions by hand, there are also relay policies that prevent a package of more than 101 KvB (virtual kilobytes) or more than 25 transactions from being relayed through the network. That means that if we needed to CPFP 50 transactions, we’d want to do them all in parallel, rather than serially. To accomplish this, we built tooling that would: look at a list of unconfirmed transactions and for each one calculate the cost to CPFP-bump that transactions to a target fee rate Aggregate those amounts as outputs in a new transaction that spent from a single input to all of the UTXOs needed to bump the target transactions in parallel Prompt the operator to send the total amount of bitcoin required (it calculated fees for the splitting transaction as well) to a single address Once the deposit was received, it would broadcast the transaction to split the deposit into one UTXO for each transaction that needed to be bumped It would then construct and broadcast CPFP transactions for each of the stuck transactions We tested this system on Regtest bumping up to 300 transactions at a time. We also had an opportunity to use it when we needed to bump the fees of several layer-connector reveal transactions on mainnet! You can see the “split” transaction here: https://mempool.space/tx/2ec4a8708524faf9901c69da8518b632ec31762730218d3b38ff40954cee882f Each of those outputs funds the CPFP to bump an inscription reveal transaction from 65 to 150 sat/vb. The art assets made up ~90% of the total data for the project. What we wanted to do was opportunistically publish all or as much of the art as we could when fees were low. But, we also didn’t want to have people see the art before the cats were ready to evolve. So, we decided to encrypt the artwork and then publish the decryption key for the artwork with the layer connector (which contains the mapping needed for a Cat to fetch its trait). This let us decouple the data publication step from the trait reveal. This let us take advantage of a time of lower fees to do the bulk data publication, while still being able to show the world the artwork at a time that made sense for the collection. The mechanics here are straightforward: before presigning artwork assets, all of the artwork for a particular layer (again, think background or eyes or mouth) is encrypted with a per-layer encryption key. That encrypted artwork is used in a presigned inscription as a stream of bytes. Then the encryption key is rendered into the layer connector (which again is presigned). When the dispatcher fetches a layer connector, it reads the mapping of Cat-ID -> art asset, and also the decryption key for that layer. When it fetches the art asset, it gets it as a byte array, and then uses browser cryptography libraries to decrypt the artwork as a png, and then finally writes it to the canvas. Putting this all together, each Quantum Cat is a small inscription that fetches a common inscription that contains dispatch, decryption, and rendering code. That code fetches as many layer-connectors as are available on-chain (some of them won't be because they are pre-signed but unbroadcast). It then uses the inscription IDs and decryption keys in these layer connectors to fetch encrypted artwork in other inscriptions, decrypts them, and then renders them to a canvas. When we need to broadcast these presigned inscriptions, we use bulk parallel CPFP transactions to bump them up to the correct fee-rate without having to commit up-front to too-high a fee. The net result of all of this is that users have a Quantum Cat in their wallet that evolves new traits and attributes over time, while still having all of its assets be immutable on Bitcoin. There are other aspects of the project that we haven’t covered here – how the browser code manages intermittent failures when fetching all these assets, how you handle curation of an evolving collection, how we managed the UTXO creation process for all the presigned assets in the first place (that one’s easy: it’s the same fan-out UTXO splitting code described above for funding the CPFP UTXOs). But I hope you find the above discussion interesting and helpful in either an inscription project or another project involving presigned transactions. This is a guest post by Rijndael.

In all the recent discussions around BitVM based layer two solutions, I had taken for granted that people discussing them and interested in the design space understood the collateralization/liquidity requirements imposed by the architecture on the operator(s). The recent discussion around the “liquidity crunch” issue shows me I was incorrect about this assumption, and that many people outside of those actively involved in BitVM development were not aware of this issue. Before I go into the liquidity crunch issue, I think it’s important to clarify one of the unique properties of a BitVM peg (called bridges by altcoin developers). In bridges built on other networks, the funds held in the actual bridge contract controlling the movement of funds between networks are what is used to actually process withdrawals. In the case of a BitVM peg, these funds are not accessible in order to fulfill withdrawals. The operator of the system (rollup, sidechain, etc.) must actually front their own liquidity in order to process user withdrawal requests. As user withdrawal requests come in, the operator actually moving the rollup state forward looks at every request, and processes those withdrawals using their own personal funds. After a period, the system then check-points its state in a cutoff committing to all pending withdrawals. After the operator has fulfilled all pending withdrawals from the last state they can then engage in a claim process from the BitVM secured funds to make themselves whole for all the capital they have fronted. The BitVM contract is established so that operators can have their ability to claim these funds revoked if they have not honored all pending withdrawals from the last state. So the general user flow is a deposit goes into a contract secured by BitVM, the operator fronts their own capital to process withdrawals, and then periodically the operator compensates themselves for the money they’ve spent out of pocket from the BitVM contract. This sets a BitVM peg apart from any other type of two way peg, introducing a liquidity requirement similar to the Lightning Network. The Liquidity Crunch The problem that Taproot Wizards identified in their write up is a result of the combination of the up-front liquidity requirements imposed on the operator and the fraud proof scheme that allows the verifiers of the BitVM to revoke the operator’s access to funds if they have not fulfilled all withdrawals in a given rollup epoch. This creates a big potential problem for the system, and particularly for the operator. For now let’s completely ignore the potential scenario of an operator intentionally refusing to process a withdrawal due to malicious censorship. That is not a concern for now in looking at the potential problems, as if an operator did such a thing, they should have their access revoked and incur the loss of whatever funds they have already spent on processing withdrawals. It is absolutely possible for an honest operator to run into a situation where, through no malicious intent on their part, they do not have access to enough liquidity to process the withdrawals pending in a single rollup epoch. If this were to occur, then an otherwise honest operator can now not compensate themselves from the BitVM contract for what they have processed without opening themselves up to a single verifier challenging them and resulting in them permanently losing access to the funds. Everything that they have spent processing withdrawals in that epoch would be lost funds they could not recover. This creates a big risk for a peg operator. Through no malicious action at all, simply through limitations of their own funds, interest rates increasing in borrowing funds, just factors of time required to access funds, they can lose a massive amount of money. This introduces a big potential instability in the peg, and it also begs the question where does the users’ money go in the event of an operator being hit with a fraud proof? The Options The important thing to note is that where the ultimate dead end destination of funds is depends on particular design choices made by the implementers of any given peg. There is a good degree of freedom available in design choices, the end destination of funds after a challenge ejects an operator has multiple options, the period after an epoch end that an operator has to fulfill all withdraws is configurable, none of these things are set in stone as a single possible way to configure them. So now that we understand the problem let’s look at some potential solutions. Throttling You could address the issue by throttling withdrawals. This would entail creating a maximum limit of funds that an operator could be bound by the contract to fulfill in any given rollup epoch. This would allow the operator to ensure that they had enough capital in order to process the maximum amount they have to. Each period the operator could process that many withdrawals, go through the claim process to compensate themselves from the BitVM contract, and then in the next epoch recycle that amount to fulfill the next wave of withdrawals. The problem with this is you don’t know when a large uptick in funds pegged into the system will occur, and you also don’t know when market activity will align to incentivize a massive amount of money to want to peg out of the system. As more funds are pegged in, the possibility of a large increase in the volume wanted to peg out at once increases. This dynamic essentially leads to an ever growing queue to get out of the system unless you increase the maximum epoch withdrawal amount, which also increases the liquidity requirements for the operator. This exacerbates the liquidity requirement these pegs have, and essentially creates a huge friction to withdrawals. Swap outs do not solve the issue, as this ultimately traps the counterparties liquidity in this ever growing queue, unlike other two way pegs where they could exit practically immediately after facilitating the swap. Multiple Operators Both BitVM 1 and BitVM 2 support having multiple verifiers in different ways, allowing more than one more to participate and be capable of revoking an operator’s access to funds. It is also possible in BitVM 2 (and some BitVM based pegs such as the Citrea rollup) to have multiple operators working in parallel. More than one entity can help process withdrawals from the peg, so multiple pools of liquidity are available to facilitate the peg. This would in principle make the entire liquidity dynamic much more scalable, as it would no longer be limited to a single entity having to front the liquidity to facilitate timely withdrawals from the system, but it introduces questions of complexity. Each UTXO deposited into the BitVM peg and bound by the contract needs to have the terms of claiming defined. That contract needs to now be able to distinguish between multiple operators, and ensure a means of distinguishing which withdrawals are associated to which operator, and ensure they can only claim what they have facilitated rather than funds meant for a different operator. It also needs to take into account how to handle the global withdrawal demand that all operators exist to facilitate. What if every operator has used all the capital they have, but there is still unmet demand? Do they all have access to BitVM funds revoked? None of them? Is there some rollover grace period similar to having a queue throttle? If there is, who is responsible if those withdrawals still aren’t facilitated the next epoch? These are all things that need to be concretely worked out. Multiple Linear Operators In addition to having multiple parallel operators, you could have a chain of linear operators. A single operator could function at a time, facilitating withdrawals, and if they were to ever run into a liquidity problem and had their access revoked from the BitVM funds the funds after a challenge/revocation process could be immediately sent to a new BitVM with a new operator. This would not address at all the risk of a single operator suffering a liquidity crunch, and they would realize the loss of whatever withdrawals they already deposited, but it would ensure someone else could step in and have a chance to continue facilitating withdrawals with the ability to claim compensation from the BitVM. This however adds a good deal of cost to the peg-in process. Generating a BitVM instance is not cheap in terms of data and interactivity, meaning that to chain linear BitVM operators together like this, you must generate for peg-ins that number of BitVMs. The Backstop In all of the cases of any peg using BitVM, there is one ultimate question: where do the funds eventually go in the worst case failure? There are ultimately two options. Either you actually burn the funds, or you put them under the control of a verifier. The first means that users' funds are now destroyed, and everyone holding funds in the peg is now rugged. The second means that the trust model has shifted outright to trusting an individual verifier or group of verifiers in a federation who unilaterally control the funds. Burning the funds is a non-starter in a model without a withdrawal throttle, as that would validate the worst-case scenario concerns voiced by Taproot Wizards. A consistent failure case of operators, regardless of parallel or linear, would result in users’ funds actually being destroyed. The only model this would be remotely safe in, would be with a withdrawal throttle; but even then if the operator(s) defined by the contract were to disappear or have their access revoked, the risk of permanent fund loss would still exist. So that leaves putting the funds back under the control of a single verifier or a group of them. In the event of a total failure of all operators, this would allow the verifier(s) involved in the system to recover users’ funds and make them whole. I don’t think this is that bad. Every BitVM instance is set up with an n-of-n multisig that handles signing all the pre-signed transactions involved in the BitVM contract. The ultimate root security model of the entire scheme is that a single one of those key holders must remain honest, and refuse to sign a dishonest dispersion of funds, in order for the system to be secure. That same security model can be applied to where funds go (minus the operator(s)) in the event of a total operator failure. That introduces the risk of a single key being lost or not cooperating burning funds though, so you could also just make it a conventional m-of-n multisig. I see no problem in this type of set up at all, it accomplishes the goal of ensuring users’ funds are not irrevocably burned without creating a wild alteration to the trust model. Ultimately if you are not a direct participant of the BitVM contract, i.e. holding one of those n-of-n keys yourself, you are still trusting a federation of some sort. Only needing to trust a single member to be honest to keep things safe is obviously superior to having to trust 3 people in a 5-of-7 multisig, but it is still a form of delegated trust. Wrapping Up At the end of the day, I think the liquidity crunch issue identified by Taproot Wizards is a very legitimate issue. Depending on the specific architecture of the peg in question, it could introduce problems from completely burning users’ funds, to losing operators’ funds even without malicious action, to simply creating an ever growing queue to exit without either halting deposits or falling back on the n-of-n group to bypass the queue. It is not however, in my opinion, something that means the idea of using BitVM to secure a two way peg is a fundamentally broken idea. I think I’ve laid out a good number of ways that specific implementations could backstop or mitigate the issue, and ultimately the reality of the n-of-n group existing and the potential to push funds in a failure case to a delegated group to handle withdrawals could address the risk of permanent loss of funds. As a last note, the pace of development in this space has hit a pace in the last year or so that I have never seen in my time here, I think it is important when discussing these developments to step back and keep a calm head while looking at the discussions that occur over trade-offs and risks. Yes, public perception is an aspect of these conversations happening in public, but these discussions should be rooted in the goal of arriving at an accurate understanding of the issues at hand. That should not take a backseat to trying to illicit or defend any particular public perception first.","category":["Opinion","BitVM","Technical","BitVM 2","BitVM Pegs"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1a9","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/national-emergency-executive-order-6102-and-the-heist-of-the-century-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"National Emergency: Executive Order 6102 and the Heist of the Century","author":"Julian Fahrer","creation_date":"2024-04-05T23:30:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI3MzQ0MzU2NTMzNjQx/default_the_6102_gold_confiscation_0.jpg","article_summary":"A comprehensive history of the events leading up to the historic Executive Order 6102 under FDR that led to widespread gold confiscation in the United States.","article_detailed_content":"Introduction Ninety-one years ago today, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled off the greatest heist in American history. Unlike most robberies, this one was entirely legal. No safe-cracking was required; no ski masks, guns, or getaway cars. Just a pen and some White House letterhead. On April 5 1933, FDR issued Executive Order 6102, making it illegal for anyone in the United States to own gold. By penalty of up to a $10,000 fine or 10 years in prison, everyone in the country was ordered to turn in their gold to the government, by the end of the month.1 EO 6102 is one of the most important milestones in the history of money. Book-ended by the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, and the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, it was a pivotal part of the process by which the USA abandoned gold for a fiat standard. As such, it’s a milestone in Bitcoin history too. Though Bitcoiners’ interest in EO 6102 extends beyond the merely historical: because it’s the quintessential cautionary tale of arbitrary government seizure of personal property, it’s also one of the best real case studies to illustrate the value of Bitcoin self-custody. Realizing that the government is not your friend is like learning that Santa Claus isn’t real. A necessary part of growing up, but a potentially traumatic fact that needs to be introduced to children carefully. Nonetheless, adulthood requires coming to grips with the fact that there’s no jolly fat man coming down the chimney with gifts in hand. In the real world, the strange fat man wears a frown and comes through your front door with an arrest warrant if you don’t pay your taxes. For many people, the story of Executive Order 6102 brings them into collision with this reality. It teaches us that the United States Government has not hesitated to brazenly confiscate its citizens' wealth at the barrel of a gun, and under the right circumstances would absolutely do it again. However, most discussion of 6102 focuses on why FDR did it and whether it was justified. This debate is framed around FDR’s overall handling of the Great Depression. On one side you have (essentially) FDR hagiography which says that he was an unmitigated American hero; that “without his New Deal, we would all have been lost.”2 On the other side, you have the (somewhat milquetoast) Republican criticism which says, well maybe FDR went too far, or maybe he actually hurt the economy as much as he helped it. Sometimes a spicy Libertarian will get hot under the collar and tell you FDR sent America down the path to welfare-statism and “accustomed Americans to the pernicious dole.”3 All of this misses the most important lesson from EO 6102, which is how FDR pulled the whole thing off. I mean, technically. Legally. This is because, despite the fact that FDR’s Presidency could justifiably be characterized as a quasi-dictatorship and, in the words of America’s foremost FDR disrespector Curtis Yarvin (aka Mencius Moldbug), “rule by personal decree”4, there were specific legal precedents and tools of executive power that he relied on to make EO 6102 kosher. This legality (fig leaf for tyranny as it may have been), is crucially important to understand. It was one of the foundational steps in codifying what would go on to become a technique for abusing Americans’ rights favored by almost every President, and has been implemented literally dozens of times in the decades since. If we have any hope of putting a stop to it, we must first learn to see it from a distance, and then stomp it out preemptively. The Use and Abuse of the National Emergency “Now, in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects, they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil purposes” - Machiavelli, The Prince and the Discourses I’m not sure anyone’s ever said that the conduct of American Presidents has on the whole not been Machiavellian enough, but in this case the historical record is clear. Dating back at least to Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus in 1862 (so he could lock people up without trial during the Civil War), ‘disregarding the laws for good objects’ has been practically a job requirement of the oval office. Carl Schmitt said that “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” Every US President since Lincoln has made absolutely sure, when necessary, to create and exploit ‘extra-constitutional’ exceptions for their own ends. In Schmitt’s case, well, you can Google him to see how he put principle into practice. In order to manufacture these exceptions in America, Presidents have almost always resorted to the incantation of a particular phrase, which reliably summons the special powers they seek. Much like coaxing a genie from a lamp. The phrase is “national emergency”. Likely, it is familiar to you. If you’re an American adult, it’s been invoked in your lifetime to help grease the skids for a colorful variety of constitutionally suspect legislation, from the ‘anti-terrorism’ provisions of the Patriot Act to the public health emergency measures of Covid-19. In fact, it’s such a mainstay of the government toolkit that use of the ‘national emergency’ has been officially sanctioned since the The 1976 National Emergencies Act. Since that date, 82 such emergencies have been declared, and 42 are still in effect today.5 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States To give you a sense of the temporal nature of these ‘emergencies’, there are still in effect: 9 from the Obama administration, 10 from Bush II, 5 from Clinton, and even one from Jimmy Carter in 1979! This is what Milton Friedman was talking about when he said “Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.” This is also the story of Executive Order 6102, for it too sprouted from an official national emergency. You can read this in order itself, where FDR states in the preamble: “I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist…” Executive Order 6102, 5 April 1933 But still, the story goes deeper. It’s not just enough to declare a national emergency and then do whatever you want. That certainly wasn’t the case in 1933. So what was FDR’s national emergency? What on earth could legally justify the seizure of all American gold? The short answer is the Great Depression and looming financial crises in 1933. But in order to really understand the twisted history of national emergencies, we have to go back another 120 years first. The Beginning: Principled Piracy In 1812, the United States was at war with Great Britain. Prior to the war, an American citizen Jabez Harrison purchased some goods in England and stashed them on an island off the coast of the United States, near Nova Scotia. About a month after the war broke out, Harrison chartered a boat, the Rapid, to retrieve the cargo and bring it to the mainland. While en route, it was captured by an American privateer called the Jefferson, who claimed the ship’s goods as a prize. Harrison felt, as you might expect, pretty aggrieved by this and sued the owner of the Jefferson. Unhappily for Harrison, he did not win back his cargo. The law was clear and unambiguous according to Supreme Court Justice William Johnson: under the well established rules of war, Harrison was “trading with the enemy”, and therefore everything he had acquired from said enemy was essentially up for grabs for the government.6 Thus the seed was planted in American law: if you trade with an enemy during war time, expect a visit from Uncle Sam with his hand out. This, believe it or not, is the legal foundation for Executive Order 6102. “But”, (I hear you interject), “By what definition could an ‘American with gold’ be reasonably classed as an enemy of the state? And besides, there wasn’t even a war in 1933!” Fantastic points, and you’re right to make them. To preface the answer, let’s first take a detour into some high level American jurisprudence. In the murky but politically charged arena of Constitutional interpretation, there are several major ‘philosophies’ that you might subscribe to. Because the Constitution was written a long time ago, we need to find a way to apply it to the present day. Where, for example, we might have new technologies or social problems today that didn’t exist when the Constitution was written (like e.g. social media, or automatic rifles, or abortion pills). In such cases, these ‘philosophies’ help judges decide the ‘right’ way of interpreting the Constitution (which also usually aligns with their personal political views, but that’s another story). If you woke up tomorrow as a Supreme Court Justice and needed a cheat sheet to help you crack a tough Constitutional nut, here are the main schools of interpretation you might rely on: 1) Textualism: where you focus on the ‘meaning’ of the law at the time, 2) Originalism: where you focus on what the framers actually intended, or 3) A ‘Living Constitution’ approach: where you basically say, ‘to hell with that old rag, we should just update it according to the demands of today’. The third approach is more or less how the law around ‘national emergencies’ has evolved. And not, like, a slow and deliberate ‘natural selection’ evolution either. More like a Frankensteinian chimera lab rat fed plutonium for breakfast. So, what began as a recognition of the simple idea that doing business with enemies during a war is bad and the government can stop it, eventually mutated into FDR seizing the gold. Now let’s fill in the gaps and show how that happened. 1917: National Emergencies Go Up There are some great contenders for Worst Year Ever in the history of abuses of individual rights in America. 1917 might be in the top five. One piece of legislation passed in 1917, the Espionage Act, was of such fine vintage that its ability to justify obscene government overreach is still being put to good use today. This package of laws was passed to, more or less, enable the government to do whatever it wanted, to anyone, who got in the way of its efforts to prosecute WWI. More than a century later, this would be the law which both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were criminally charged under. 1917 was also the first time the phrase “national emergency” passed into the formal language of the Presidency. Invoked by Woodrow Wilson first in his Proclamation 1354, the emergency at hand was that there were apparently not enough boats to ship out all of America’s exports to customers around the world. As a result, Wilson gave the Shipping Board the power to control the sale and use of freight ships in America.7 Leasing your cargo ship to foreign interests? You just did a heckin’ violation. This would not be the last national emergency of 1917, however. After America declared war on Germany on April 6, the administration now had a number of new problems to deal with. Aside from fighting the war itself, there was the issue of what to do with all the German business interests in America, and vice-versa. In the years since The Rapid, global trade and commerce had advanced substantially. Now, there was a vast web of commercial relationships between America and its new enemy, which would take quite a bit of effort to disentangle. The solution was the Trading with the Enemy Act, which brought the principle of The Rapid into legislation and vastly expanded it. The official purpose of the TWEA was to “define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy.”8 In practice, the goal was twofold: to confiscate German resources for the benefit of the US war effort, and to prevent Germany from doing the converse.9 Democratic Congressman Andrew Montague argued in favor of the Bill by saying, “perhaps in no former war was trade ever so potential a weapon in the hands of a belligerent as in the present conflict. This is not a war of soldiers so much as a war of economic forces.”10 This, three years into a war that had already cost many millions of lives. For obvious reasons, history has largely forgotten what German businesses and civilians endured in America for the rest of the war. Estimates are that 6000 men were sent to internment camps, and around half a billion dollars in assets permanently confiscated.11 Source: New York Herald on March 28, 1918, https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/us-confiscated-half-billion-dollars-private-property-during-wwi-180952144/ This was all authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act. One section of it in particular, however, would go on to be the lynchpin in the Executive Order 6102 story. That was Section 5b, which gave the President complete power to investigate, regulate, or prohibit any transactions dealing in “foreign exchange”, or by any foreign country.12 You might sense now that we’re getting warmer. The TWEA power is evolving, and EO 6102 beginning to take shape, gradually getting clearer like a shadowy apparition emerging from the darkness. But we’re not there yet. There was one more hurdle to get over, for the President’s power in 1917 was still limited to “during the time of war.”13 It would take another catastrophe more urgent even than World War One to get over it. Great Depression: FDR’s Opportunity That catastrophe would come in 1933, following four years of unimaginable suffering during the Great Depression and a quickly spiraling financial crisis. Three days before FDR was inaugurated, on 1 March 1933, the head of the New York Federal Reserve branch, George Harrison, was in panic mode. The bank’s gold reserve had fallen below the legal limit. Harrison sent a memo to Washington saying that he would “no longer take responsibility” for the bank’s “deficient reserves”.14 What was going on? Well, in 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created, a ‘gold standard’ was built into its framework. The Fed was required to hold gold equal to 40 percent of the value of the dollars it issued, and to convert those dollars into gold at a fixed price.15 The problem was, the US was in the middle of a deflationary crisis. The economy had been going backward for years. Gradually then suddenly, people began to seek the safety of gold, and withdraw it from banks all over the country. However, there was one big problem: there was simply not enough gold. As FDR would admit publicly a couple of months later, the government’s debts amounted to $30 billion in gold, and private gold-denominated debt totaled another $60-70B. Meanwhile, “all of the gold in the United States amounted to only between three and four billions and that all of the gold in all of the world amounted to only about eleven billions.”16 FDR’s interpretation of the moment is recorded in his inaugural address. He used the speech to wage a broad attack against the excesses of capitalism which he (and history) would scapegoat for causing the 1929 and Great Depression. He called out the “unscrupulous money changers”, and the “falsity of material wealth”, and demanded that “there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.”17 Now, if you’ve been paying attention, you shouldn’t be surprised by what he said next. Yes - it was indeed a national emergency. One so severe that it required a “broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.”18 It was all downhill from there. Two days after FDR’s term began, he took action to stop the gold run by simply closing the banks. The March 6 Proclamation 2039 instituted a ‘Bank Holiday’ from 6-9 March, outlawing any withdrawal of gold, to stop the “hoarding”.19 Stopping the run wasn’t enough, though. Hoarders were now enemies of the State, and the Fed wanted names. On March 8, the St. Louis Fed sent a memo to member banks, requesting “the names and addresses of all persons who have withdrawn gold from your bank since February 1, 1933.”20 On March 9 1933, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, granting FDR almost full personal control over the entire banking system. It gave him authority to regulate “any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin.”21 Now, here is our link back to 1917. As we mentioned earlier, the Trading with the Enemy Act restricted this power to war time operations. But as was foreshadowed in FDR’s inaugural address, the Emergency Banking Act (EBA) would help FDR get past this technicality. Specifically, it amended the TWEA to ensure that FDR had the power to regulate commerce “during time of war”, or crucially, “during any other period of national emergency declared by the President.” FDR had his crisis, and now he had his emergency powers. A couple of weeks after the passage of the EBA he would issue Executive Order 6102, and then the job was mostly done. By and large, everyone complied. The day after the Order, the New York Times ran an article on the front page with the headline: “HOARDERS IN FRIGHT TURN IN $30,000,000; Gold Pours Into Banks and the Federal Reserve as Owners Act to Avoid Penalty”22 This brings us to the end of the story. From The Rapid, to the Trading with the Enemy Act, to the Emergency Banking Act, to Executive Order 6102. The evolution was complete, and enshrined the national emergency exception into Presidential powers from then on. Natural disasters, foreign wars, domestic wars, public health emergencies. This is the story of two hundred years of Presidential power. The law is the law, until it isn’t. Conclusion: Could It Happen Again? Ultimately, this is really what everyone should ask about EO 6102. Could it happen again? Could some unholy triumvirate of the Fed, Treasury Department, and Elizabeth Warren channel the spirit of FDR and attempt a mass seizure of Bitcoin? Nobody can really know, but the best way I can answer the question is with the help of the trusty Midwit meme (see below), which gives us three ways of predicting the likely outcomes. The Left Curve answer is to do a basic pattern match between 1933 and today. People had money the government couldn’t control; Government wasn’t happy; Government stole the money. No more analysis required: the Feds will steal your stuff. The Midwit answer is to carefully compare and contrast the nature of Gold with respect to the American economy of April 1933, versus Bitcoin and today, and to distinguish between the ruthlessly efficient dictatorial powers of FDR and the bungling and incompetent bureaucratic oligarchy of 2024. This isn’t exactly wrong, as the Midwit never quite is. The particular problem for the government in 1933 was that almost every commercial contract in the country was backed by gold, as was the dollar, and a breakneck run on Gold was threatening to implode the economy. None of these things is true about Bitcoin. But the Midwit is never quite right either. The Right Curve answer (if I may humbly submit), is presented in this essay. The meaning of the Executive Order 6102 story is not in the exactness of the analogy from Gold in 1933 to Bitcoin in 2024. Rather, it is the nature of the legal power wielded by FDR to expropriate the property of American citizens, the ubiquity and breadth of its use by every President since, and the likelihood of it being used again in the future. History has shown that the invocation of national emergencies has, time and time again, given the United States government almost unlimited capacity to encroach on civil liberties. What does the next national emergency look like? A mass flight to safety from the US dollar into the hardest asset ever known? Could 175T of unfunded liabilities23 trigger a catastrophic restructuring of American debt? Or perhaps another hot war or three? We don’t know what the crisis will be; only that there will be one. As the state debases the currency at an accelerating rate, and its liabilities balloon out of control, it will get desperate. In late-stage Fiat, just as in the Kingdom of Alice in Wonderland’s Red Queen, the state must run faster and faster just to stay in the same place. And when the moment of crisis comes, the Right Curve prediction is simple: the Feds will steal your stuff. Only this time, it might be different. For the first time, sovereign custody of Bitcoin has a chance at keeping private wealth safe from public expropriation. So to conclude, the lesson as always is: not your keys, not your coins. And see you in hell, FDR.

Advances in agriculture meant that people and their property were often geographically stationary, making them sitting ducks for “specialists in violence”, the predecessors to modern governments, who back then, were both the plunderers and protectors against plunder. The stirrup, contoured saddle, spur, and curb bit had a combined similar disrupting effect, shifting power away from heavy cavalry to a single armed knight. The Gunpowder Revolution disrupted the feudal order of the day, reinforced in those days by the Catholic Church. Rees-Mogg and Davidson write, “the Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system.” The printing press disrupted the Church even further: causing it to lose its monopoly on biblical narrative. The result was a major loss in its influence and power, which gave way to the modern nation state. Rees-Mogg and Davidson argue that the microprocessor would inevitably disrupt the nation state in the same way that the printing press disrupted Christendom a few hundred years ago. The internet itself (a globally-interconnected community) and public key cryptography (which protects both communications and property of Bitcoin) are made possible by microprocessors. The present and future One major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the currency front. Since Bitcoin’s 2009 inception, we have been able to transact permissionlessly, borderlessly, and (often) anonymously. Nation states have long been jealous of any challenge to their monopoly on money, and they will spend vast sums of money to ensure that there are no serious monetary rivals. Bitcoin serves as an alternative to that trap, which is why it is under attack by the likes of politicians and the crumbling legacy media. But to transact on Bitcoin, you need miners. No doubt, regulators in the United States and Europe observed as China outlawed Bitcoin mining in 2021, which only resulted in the majority of the hashing power moving from that country to the United States. So while they would probably wish to ban it in the United States and Europe outright, they know that they would only lose both regulatory control and tax revenue from Bitcoin miners by doing so. Thus, for now, not even Elizabeth Warren – the most Bitcoin-hostile legislator in Washington – proposes to outright ban Bitcoin. Instead, she proposes to expand know-your-customer (KYC) rules to essentially all parties within the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as discourage self-custody and privacy-enhancing technologies. Bitcoin does have an important weak point of centralization (for now): the hardware. The University of Cambridge produces industry reports on Bitcoin mining and communicates that, hardware-wise, the overwhelming majority of Bitcoin miners report to use an “ASIC” chip for mining Bitcoin’s SHA-256 hashing algorithm produced by Singapore-based company Bitmain, with competitors MicroBT and Canaan trailing behind. Regardless of where Bitmain produces its ASIC chips, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin’s decentralization would be that production of ASIC miners (and the mining itself for that matter) would be dispersed around the world so that no specific region could have a definitive advantage, taking the majority control of the hashing power. A reasonable compromise would be one in which ASIC miners were produced, at scale and in high quality, by at least more manufacturers than there are now, especially across countries that are not politically aligned with one another so that collusion between them would be increasingly unlikely. A second major battlefront for decentralization is fought on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) front. I once attended a conference in which Peter Thiel participated as a speaker. He said something very close to the following (quoted from my memory): “Bitcoin is a technology that, on net, favors the individual. AI is a technology that, on net, favors the state.” It is the latter technology and its favoring the state that emphasizes the importance of getting it into the hands of as many participants as possible if we are to build a truly decentralized world. One risk to AI’s decentralization is one that Bitcoin has in common: a potential future scenario in which hardware is monitored and must be registered by law. In the case of Bitcoin, that would mean miners must register their ASIC chips. In the case of AI, it could mean that even you or I would need to register graphics processing units (GPUs) above a certain capacity (or, in the case of software, that matrices must be registered). Guillaume Verdon, the name behind the now doxed alias @BasedBeffJesos, highlighted this risk in a podcast with Lex Fridman, arguing that this could “[stop] the open source ecosystem from thriving… by executive order, claiming that open source LLMs are dual-use technologies and should be government-controlled.” Although executive orders could not kill Bitcoin (but could discourage some people from using it), similar reporting requirements for miners would likely, to some degree, impact Bitcoin’s open source ecosystem. A third major battleground worth highlighting is 3D printers, assemblers, and other tools in the “maker” arsenal. This “maker” movement hints at a future solution to the problem of centralization tendencies for Bitcoin and AI. Imagine a world with 3D printers and accompanying tools in most people’s homes. If you could print your own high-quality ASIC Bitcoin miners and GPUs for running large language models (LLMs), decentralization is light-years ahead. We can ignore for a moment the futuristic scenario in which 3D printers and other “maker” tools are used to produce hardware for Bitcoin and AI applications. Even at present, at least one government is looking at the 3D printer with the same skeptical eye that the Catholic Church had for the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. New York State’s Assembly Bill A8132, if passed into law, would require criminal background checks, with fingerprints sent to the FBI, in order to purchase 3D printers “capable of creating firearms.” It is reasonable to expect that various governments, fearing loss of their own centralized power, will continue to push registration and “KYC” requirements to maintain control of real-space tools that facilitate decentralization in cyberspace. Note: The Soviet Union had similar controls on seemingly harmless products such as books, photocopiers, fax machines – all of which facilitated the spread of information, and thus, threatened the regime. There were similar efforts to control the sale of fabric that could be used to build hot air balloons in East Germany, to stop people from escaping to West Germany. (See the 1982 American film Night Crossing and the 2018 German film Balloon that both document a real escape). Localized manufacturing, whether at home or in a so-called community fabrication laboratory or “fab lab”, is likely to come under increased hostility by various governments as 3D printers and other “maker” tools are able to produce even more sophisticated electronics. But, for now at least, fab labs are growing exponentially in number, with well over 2,000 of them spread around the world so far, and even receive various levels of support by governments. These fab labs, by the way, don’t account for the many more personalized labs in people’s homes. Neil Gershenfeld at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms tries to understand what the world looks like when almost anybody can make almost anything and when machines can make other machines, even machines more sophisticated than themselves, and often with locally-sourced materials. Gershenfeld argues in a podcast appearance that localized manufacturing doesn’t scale and that production is generally for personal use, not commercial sale. But when many thousands of people around the world learn how to locally produce their own 3D-printed and home-assembled Bitcoin miner and then combine their individual hashing power with others in a mining pool and coordinate with one another over the Tor network… then the world starts to look much more decentralized. Conclusion Bitcoin, AI, and 3D printers share a common theme of decentralization and disruptive potential for the nation state. As both Bitcoin’s ASIC mining chips and GPUs used to run LLMs exist in real-space where nation states are most dominant, governments may become increasingly hostile towards such hardware: requiring criminal background checks, KYC, etc. Interestingly, 3D printers, assemblers, and other “maker” tools could be used now or in the future for localized manufacturing (whether at home or in so-called “fab labs”), enabling a much more decentralized world. Meanwhile, on the policy front, criminal background checks and registration requirements for 3D printers and other “maker” tools such as those proposed in New York’s Assembly Bill A8132 deserve a skeptical eye and strong political pushback.

By framing mining as both a commercial opportunity and crisis mitigation tool, Bhutan has embraced Bitcoin more fully than most nations. Its renewable hydropower reserves also make it an ideal location for eco-friendly mining. The new investment in cutting-edge mining hardware comes as the Bitcoin network faces a halving in mid-April. The quadrennial event cuts block rewards for miners in half, impacting revenue. Bhutan cited offsetting the halving's impact as a motivation for expanding its mining operations. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, far below the global average of up to $45,000.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETF is fast approaching, new applications have come in from an unexpected source: some of the biggest traditional asset managers in Mainland China. Hong Kong’s new ETF has been in the making for several months now, and it’s been attracting no small amount of interest in the digital asset space worldwide. Not only is its in-kind generation model a totally different protocol than the style of Bitcoin spot ETF popularized by the United States, but it’s also an important foothold for ETF acceptance in East Asia. The already-approved Hong Kong futures ETF’s total assets under management (AUM) already passed the $100 million mark in February, and the spot ETF has performed better in every country where it’s gotten the green light. With this economic region having both substantial capital investment and plenty of international finance connections, Hong Kong would make the perfect candidate for a new testing ground in this market. Even the most bullish reads on the situation, however, have not predicted the emergence of a new player in this space. By late March 2024, there were a large array of HK-based capital firms that had expressed some form of interest in launching their own ETF, but only a comparative handful had actually submitted a formal application. This situation changed radically on April 8th, when a series of big players from Mainland China threw their hats in the ring. Harvest Fund, with over $230 billion in total AUM, and Southern Fund, with over $280 billion AUM, both filed applications of their own through HK-based subsidiaries. Additionally, local media reported that China Asset Management, with $270 billion in AUM, had its own subsidiary enter into an unspecified partnership with existing Bitcoin ETF providers in the city. Considering that there are already signs of diminishing ETF hype in the US market, news like this certainly comes as a breath of fresh air. Even if US ETF issuers like BlackRock or Fidelity command several trillion in AUM, the sudden appearance of these multibillion-dollar firms is nothing to sneeze at. It does beg the question, however, of how smoothly interactions between these Mainland firms and Hong Kong financial regulations will actually work together. Isn’t Bitcoin banned in China, with its use among Chinese citizens almost fully underground? How long will a partnership like this actually last? As it turns out, the blanket ban is somewhat overstated in Western media. After all, if Bitcoin was purely contraband in China, why would Chainalysis report $90 billion worth of transactions in one year? Source Mainland China has certainly taken a harsher attitude toward Bitcoin in recent years, to be sure. After the Bitcoin mining ban in 2021, one of the largest worldwide hubs for mining dried up practically overnight. However, the apparent crackdown leaves many windows open to the market. Essentially, the main goal for Chinese authorities has been to raise the bar to entry and make it more annoying and difficult for average citizens to continue accessing this market. Additionally, with many legitimate businesses unable to operate, Chinese Bitcoiners are given an implicit warning: “If you get scammed, don’t expect our help or sympathy.\" Nevertheless, savvy adherents have found ways to continue using their leaderless currency, and these quiet trades evidently amount to many billions. It’s that same ambiguous attitude that makes these new ETF developments so encouraging. Three of the largest asset managers in all of China have signed onto the project in quick succession, and it’s no small commitment; if these firms become ETF issuers, they’ll be entangled in a business with record-breaking trade volumes and broad international interest. It would hardly be the first time that Chinese capital firms have invested heavily in Bitcoin-related ventures, but mining hardware in faraway Ethiopia is very different from financial instruments in a city that’s legally part of China. By making this leap, these firms have found a way to legally entangle themselves with the world of Bitcoin, and the entanglement will even predominantly involve Chinese citizens. Click the image to learn more. Such a move could do a great deal to show both investors and regulators that the world of Bitcoin is nothing to fear but instead a very exciting opportunity. Hong Kong’s aforementioned in-kind model means that new buyers will have to trade custodied Bitcoins for a corresponding share in the ETF instead of merely purchasing it with fiat. In other words, there will be an undeniable and direct link between prestigious national businesses and a trade that operates largely out of sight. Could this link convince party officials that Bitcoin has a place in China after all? Will the ETF issuers try to throw their weight around and lobby for Bitcoin’s re-entry into the legal system? How will the complicated relationship between the PRC and Hong Kong impact the entire arrangement? As far as Hong Kong’s side of the arrangement is concerned, they seem quite committed to the dream of creating a regional crypto hub. Not only have local banks shown an increasing acceptance of the digital asset space as a whole, but this is small potatoes compared to the news from HashKey Global. The South China Morning Post reported on April 8th that HashKey Group, an HK-based exchange that only deals in Bitcoin and Ethereum, opened off its new “Global” initiative with an exchange based in Bermuda. HashKey announced this plan at the Web3 Festival, and the Bermuda operations are set to be just the first step in an ambitious undertaking: the long-term hope is to “overtake US-based crypto giant Coinbase in trading volume within five years.\" A very tall order. And yet, Chief Operating Officer Livio Weng did not seem particularly concerned, telling the Post that “We have seen their data and we don’t think that’ll be difficult”. He added that most global competitors are either “easy to use but not compliant”, or “compliant but hard to use”, and the challenges of Chinese regulation have given his company a substantial leg up in this department. It’s been difficult to offer a practical and enticing service to customers while still maintaining regulatory compliance, so the laxer restrictions worldwide will make HashKey a big fish in a small pond. For example, the Bermuda exchange is already set to offer nearly 20 more digital assets than the original Hong Kong operation. Chinese citizens living abroad are also a definite target demographic. This sort of enthusiasm is certainly a bold statement in the world of Bitcoin! Even in a chaotic market like this, the exchange business’ reigning champs won’t be overthrown easily. Yet, this sort of confidence was reportedly mirrored by the other attendees at the Web3 Festival, as the whole community has pinned its hopes on a rising Bitcoin price. Mainland firms are showing a real willingness to enter the world of Bitcoin through Hong Kong, and the city’s own existing firms are confident that they’ll be worth many billions in short order. Is it really so difficult to imagine that a success here could change the whole paradigm for China? It’s for these reasons that the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong is so hotly anticipated by observers worldwide. A new spin on the same financial instrument could shake up the entire paradigm, bringing lifeblood to ETFs internationally. However, if China reverses its hostility towards Bitcoin, it could frankly be an even bigger upset than the spot ETF itself. It’s for these reasons that we should watch carefully for developments in this space, as it seems likely that the impact will reverberate in one way or another. The signs are all looking bullish for Bitcoin, and the next big opportunity could be just around the corner.","category":["Bitcoin ETF","Hong Kong","Markets","Bitcoin Magazine Pro"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e195","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-startups-raised-nearly-1-billion-between-2021-and-2023-report","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Bitcoin Startups Raised Nearly $1 Billion between 2021 And 2023: Report","author":"Nik Hoffman","creation_date":"2024-04-11T20:30:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQyNjcxMjA3NzUzMTU3/default_detailed_bitcoin_report_0.jpg","article_summary":"Bitcoin startups raised $301 million through all of last year alone.","article_detailed_content":"Trammell Venture Partners (TVP), based in Austin, Texas, has unveiled its second annual findings from its in-depth research into the burgeoning Bitcoin-native startup and venture capital ecosystem. Despite a notable downturn in crypto venture market investments throughout 2023, TVP's research highlights a remarkable surge in the Bitcoin startup sector, particularly at the Pre-Seed stage, with a striking 360% year-over-year rise in transaction count. Contrary to the broader startup landscape experiencing a decline in exit activity to a 10-year low in 2023, Bitcoin-native startups showed resilience and growth, marking a 69.2% increase year-over-year. TVP's data revealed that these early-stage Bitcoin startups collectively raised nearly $1 billion between 2021 and 2023, signifying a substantial interest and investment in this sector. Christopher Calicott, TVP's managing director and founding partner, commented on the findings, noting a strong desire among founders to build on Bitcoin. He highlighted the increasing support infrastructure and technical advancements that are fueling innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. “The early indicators from the TVP research are in line with the expectations we have had for ‘crypto’ venture’s end state: founders really want to be building on Bitcoin specifically,” said Calicott. “With a rapidly growing array of tech enablements fueling enhanced scalability and buildability on Bitcoin, this long-held TVP hypothesis is becoming an evidence- and data-supported reality.” In 2023, Bitcoin-native venture deal count grew significantly, rising 69.2%, while broader crypto venture deal counts were down 35.3%. Though with the increase in Bitcoin-native venture deals, crypto venture deals still account for the overwhelming majority of deal count and venture dollars invested. “Due to cyclicality and bitcoin’s institutional embrace, its market cap dominance is even greater than at the time of our 2023 report,” Calicott continued. “Despite this, allocation to Bitcoin-native venture capital remains very low, relatively speaking. We believe that delta will begin to close as more allocators start to see the compounding benefits from a rapidly expanding design space on Bitcoin thanks to these early-stage Bitcoin startups.” TVP's commitment to driving insights and research for the venture capital landscape led to the launch of the industry's first dedicated Bitcoin-native ecosystem-focused fund series in 2021. This annual release of TVP's Emerging Bitcoin-Native Venture Capital Landscape Research Brief aims to provide valuable data and support for institutional investors looking to explore opportunities within the growing Bitcoin startup sector. The full TVP Bitcoin startup ecosystem research brief is available for download, offering a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape and investment opportunities in Bitcoin-native technologies.","category":["Trammell Venture Partners","Report","Markets","Bitcoin","News","Start Up"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e19c","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/200-billion-us-bitcoin-spot-etfs-trading-volume","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/200-billion-us-bitcoin-spot-etfs-trading-volume","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"$200 Billion: US Bitcoin Spot ETFs Top $200 Billion in Trading Volume","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-10T20:54:41Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk4NzgwODE5OTI5MDQ4NDI3/pile-of-bitcoins.jpg","article_summary":"U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have topped $200 billion in cumulative trading volume just three months after launching, led by major providers like BlackRock.","article_detailed_content":"U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed $200 billion in cumulative trading volume since launching just three months ago.

This comes after spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record monthly volume of $111 billion in March, triple that of February. The ETFs debuted on January 11th when bitcoin traded around $45,000. Since then, bitcoin has climbed to an all-time high above $73,000, buoying interest and trading activity. BlackRock's IBIT leads the volumes, which now hold over 265,000 bitcoins worth more than $18 billion. IBIT comprises nearly 50% of the total spot ETF volume. Meanwhile, Grayscale's GBTC and Fidelity's FBTC rank second and third in market share. The success of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs has prompted applications in other markets like Hong Kong. Regulators there are expected to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs in Asia this month, potentially adding more volume. ETF providers cite surging institutional demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The funds present an easy vehicle for both retail and professional investors to gain bitcoin price exposure. The $200 billion cumulative volume indicates growing bitcoin's maturation since the last bull run when ETF hopes were repeatedly dashed. The growth of bitcoin ETFs signals widening adoption by traditional finance, a mainstream integration that will likely persist as the asset class evolves.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1a0","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/watch-the-bitcoin-policy-summit-is-happening-now-in-washington-dc","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/watch-the-bitcoin-policy-summit-is-happening-now-in-washington-dc","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"WATCH: The Bitcoin Policy Summit is Happening Now in Washington, DC","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","creation_date":"2024-04-09T21:22:44Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODQ1OTM3MTIwOTE5/bitcoin-goes-to-washington-bitcoin-and-money-laundering-2014-commerce.jpg","article_summary":"Leading United States congressmen, industry leaders and academics are meeting in the U.S. capital to discuss the political and economic importance of Bitcoin in the United States.","article_detailed_content":"The second annual Bitcoin Policy Summit by the Bitcoin Policy Institute begins today in Washington, DC and features leading bipartisan lawmakers, Bitcoin experts and human rights advocates.

Despite some mainstream scepticism over the years, Scaramucci has maintained a bullish long-term outlook on Bitcoin as an emerging digital store of value. He cites generational wealth transfers and Bitcoin-friendly demographics as setting the stage for massive growth. Scaramucci also touched on the FTX collapse, its impact, regulatory issues, and his optimism regarding the Bitcoin industry's future maturation.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1a6","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/despite-criticism-lightning-network-continues-seeing-major-rollouts-","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/despite-criticism-lightning-network-continues-seeing-major-rollouts-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Despite Criticism, Lightning Network Continues Seeing Major Rollouts ","author":"Landon Manning","creation_date":"2024-04-08T19:00:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTkyNTg1NDQ2NjMxMzI0/default_the_bitcoin_lightning_network_1.jpg","article_summary":"The Lightning Network is facing a growing number of developers that consider it a “dead end” as capacity drops. Nevertheless, major new partnerships keep breathing in new life.","article_detailed_content":"The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin’s revolutionary Lightning Network has seen two major rollout initiatives begin in the last month, with new access for both the Southeast Asian region and Coinbase worldwide; nevertheless, it faces increased criticism that the entire protocol is fundamentally flawed. The Lightning Network is a Layer-2 protocol being developed on Bitcoin’s blockchain with the ambitious aim of trying to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem. Since the theory behind this protocol was first developed in 2016, it has seen major attention from the entire industry as a revolutionary new potential future. Essentially, Lightning seeks to further embrace the decentralized nature of Bitcoin by relying on a mesh network of locally hosted nodes to carry out its main functions. Microtransactions of BTC are made by various users, and they are processed through these nodes; smart contracts enforce a system where these tiny transactions are shuffled around and bundled. Then, these larger bundles are actually processed directly on the original blockchain, so congestion there is minimized and it’s feasible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. Since development began, large and influential figures have endorsed the project; most famously, El Salvador’s government uses Lightning to make Bitcoin an accessible payment option for its whole citizenry. Despite the early hype for the program, a persistent viewpoint that the project has stagnated has been on the rise. Going back years, multiple defenses of Lightning’s long-term viability as a concept have also acknowledged its setbacks, claiming that the technology might not be sufficient as a “silver bullet” to solve the scaling problem itself. Even as the network grew to its largest heights, a series of problems remained unshakeable. For example, smaller nodes may not have the practical capacity or startup capital to actually move users’ money around; bugs hinder the user experience; merchant access is somewhat lacking; as well as other concerns. Although these problems have been well-known, by April 2024, a few signs are leading community members to question if a breaking point has come. A series of long-term developers have publicly quit the project and denounced its flaws, and this list includes both the protocol’s original authors. As Paul Sztorc, Lightning developer and CEO at Layer Two Labs, put it, “everyone now admits that you cannot onboard 8 billion people” to Lightning, a “microscopic” amount of total Bitcoin is actually available on Lightning, and most damningly, “almost everyone who uses the real thing dislikes it” amidst a series of complaints. Indeed, a particularly concerning statistic on Lightning’s future prospects has emerged, as the network’s capacity for Bitcoin is steadily dropping even as its dollar capacity is at an all-time high. Source Nevertheless, these problems have not led the community as a whole to consider the project finished. For one thing, some long-term developers have displayed continued optimism and willingness to keep building, and the determined spirit of Bitcoin has not left Lightning yet. More to the point, however, major progress is being made in the field of reliable market accessibility. In March 2024, Lightning company Neutronpay secured $1.5 million in venture capital bridge funding to deepen network infrastructure and viability in Southeast Asia. Continued projects like this are vital to ensuring that users in less-developed regions are still able to access secure nodes. This victory pales in comparison to the events of April 3rd, however, as Coinbase finalized a secure partnership to roll out Lightning on its platform. Coinbase has voiced its general support for Lightning access for several months, but only a concrete agreement with a partner like Lightspark can turn this support into access for the exchange’s worldwide user base. Coinbase is one of the largest exchanges in the world, with more than $150 billion in transaction volume on a quarterly basis, so combining its vast resources with Lightspark’s specific technical know-how is sure to create durable node infrastructure. One of the biggest concerns for the network as a whole is the myriad problems that faulty nodes can create, so Coinbase will surely be a bulwark in that respect. The whole situation for the Lightning Network bears remarkable similarities with Ordinals, another popular Layer-2 protocol for Bitcoin. Rather than create a platform to process Bitcoin microtransactions as regular payments, Ordinals instead seeks to transform BTC into a more durable microformat, not to be spent in regular payments. Ordinals is able to “inscribe” unique data onto individual denominations of bitcoin, which enables popular new tokenized assets to exist integrated with the leading blockchain. Of course, the project is not only used for these tokenized assets, as the inscription can be used to incorporate a huge variety of information into the indelible blockchain. In a particularly memorable episode, some developers even use Ordinals to inscribe discontinued video games. Download the full 20-page research report prepared by Tuur Demeester (Founder, Adamant Research) for Unchained. This entire concept has drawn a fair share of ire from certain sectors of the community. Influential developer Luke Dashjr, for example, claimed that the entire rationale behind Ordinals is a “vulnerability” in Bitcoin, one that is being “exploited... to spam the blockchain.\" The popularity of the Ordinals BRC-20 token has even been linked to major congestion issues in Bitcoin, and Dashjr proposed a way to “fix” this alleged vulnerability and sabotage Ordinals’ continued functioning. Even as the network congestion has declined, the whole concept still sees pushback. Binance quoted their “ongoing efforts to streamline product offerings” as a rationale for completely removing Ordinals from their platform in April. The criticism of Lightning does substantially differ from that of Ordinals, to be sure. Lightning’s detractors call it a failed attempt to help Bitcoin’s usability, while Ordinals’ critics see its success as a threat to the same goal. Nevertheless, there are a number of similarities between the two positions: both have developed a cadre of vocal opponents, and both have seen recent practical setbacks to their overall capacity. Developers on Bitcoin’s blockchain have always been an eclectic bunch, holding a wide variety of entirely different viewpoints on how to make Bitcoin better. Especially considering that the world of Bitcoin is both global and leaderless, it’s no wonder that these complex Layer-2 protocols step on a few toes. And yet, neither one of them is completely defeated. Dashjr’s proposal to disable Ordinals was firmly rejected by the community, and development continues. In an impressive turn, the trillion-dollar finance giant Franklin Templeton even endorsed Ordinals with a report from their Digital Assets Division. This report claimed that Ordinals was driving a “renaissance” in Bitcoin adoption and that the new Ordinals products have both energized Bitcoin’s user base and clearly demonstrated the blockchain’s flexibility and superiority over its competitors. Praise like this from such an important source could truly be groundbreaking. Events like this serve, more than anything, to prove once again that Bitcoin’s spirit is not merely posed to disrupt established industries and build a more rational order on the wreckage. Developers from around the world also have a determined ability to keep working on a project in the hard times, and this spirit has served us well on Bitcoin’s rocky road to the top. Lightning and Ordinals developers have both shown a continued ability to refine their projects despite great adversity, and that spirit has been rewarded with newfound institutional acceptance. It’s unclear at present where exactly either of these projects will go from here or if a newer Layer-2 solution will eclipse them both as the next revolution in Bitcoin. No matter what happens, however, it’s clear that Bitcoin as a whole will be stronger for it.","category":["Markets","Lightning network","Bitcoin Magazine Pro"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1ab","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-australia-this-summer","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/first-spot-bitcoin-etf-australia-this-summer","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"First Spot Bitcoin ETF to launch in Australia, Says Monochrome","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-05T21:02:10Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTI0NzQ0MDIyMjcxMzY5/group-3689-1.png","article_summary":"Monochrome plans to launch Australia's first spot bitcoin ETF holding physical BTC, pending approval from Cboe Australia expected by mid-2024.","article_detailed_content":"Australian asset manager Monochrome plans to launch the nation's first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that holds physical bitcoin.

The firm expects approval by mid-2024. Unlike previous bitcoin exchange-traded products in Australia, Monochrome's ETF would hold actual bitcoin. This structure mirrors the highly successful spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has already greenlighted Monochrome's proposal. Cboe Australia is now reviewing the application. \"We anticipate a decision from Cboe Australia about the Monochrome Bitcoin ETF before the middle of 2024,\" said CEO Jeff Yew. \"The Monochrome Bitcoin ETF stands to be the first Bitcoin ETF in Australia authorized to hold Bitcoin directly.\" If approved, the ETF would provide local investors with direct exposure to bitcoin through a regulated investment vehicle. Monochrome said it chose Cboe for its strategic expertise and extensive reach across Asia. The firm had originally planned to list on rival exchange ASX, but it has since pivoted to Cboe's platform. Australia joining the spot bitcoin ETF movement could further validate Bitcoin as an investable asset class, as Monochrome is aiming to tap surging institutional demand as the Bitcoin industry matures. The fund's launch would arrive just before Bitcoin's next halving event, likely boosting interest. As the first to hold physical bitcoin, Monochrome could quickly dominate the local ETF space in Australia.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1ae","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/report-morgan-stanley-ubs-bitcoin-etfs-all-clients","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/report-morgan-stanley-ubs-bitcoin-etfs-all-clients","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Report: Morgan Stanley 'Racing' to Offer Bitcoin ETFs to All Clients","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-04T20:33:24Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTAwMjYxMDk4MDcxNTkw/moran.jpg","article_summary":"Morgan Stanley is racing to become the first major U.S. bank to fully approve Bitcoin ETF trading, a pivotal move for Bitcoin adoption.","article_detailed_content":"Morgan Stanley is working to become the first major U.S. banks to offer a spot Bitcoin ETFs to all clients, according to social media reports. With $1.5 trillion in assets under management respectively, Morgan Stanley is one of the largest wealth managers worldwide. A fully approve Bitcoin ETF trading on its platform would mark a pivotal moment for institutional Bitcoin adoption. The reports come from Bitcoin insider Andrew on X and Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Andrew, an influential Bitcoin commentator, tweeted Morgan Stanley may announce its Bitcoin ETF listing \"days before\" rival UBS. He said global banks have been urgently discussing adding the products. UPDATE: several notes from @MorganStanley execs this AM; salty about @UBS post yesterday. They want to be the first wirehouse to fully approve the #Bitcoin ETF's. - @MorganStanley may announce a few days before @UBS. - interesting that global banks are talking about $BTC ETF's… — Andrew (@AP_Abacus) April 3, 2024 Initially skeptical, Bloomberg's Balchunas agreed the firms are playing a \"compliance game of chicken\" on Bitcoin ETF approvals. But a UBS spokesperson reached out to Bitcoin Magazine for comment, stating that “UBS has no plans to change the conditions for offering spot bitcoin ETFs to clients,” and that the above “social media reports regarding UBS are not accurate.” A potential upcoming Morgan Stanley launch would mark a major milestone for Bitcoin's mainstream acceptance. Morgan Stanley adding BTC ETF trading would be a stunning U-turn after CEO James Gorman said last year he didn't think Bitcoin had much uptake as an institutional asset class. Access could be imminent, pending strict compliance reviews. But a green light would still represent a watershed moment for Bitcoin. Major wealth managers offering ETF trading would convey growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity and expose millions of new investors to the market. Being a leader in Bitcoin ETFs could attract billions in new client assets. The moves also signal growing confidence in Bitcoin's longevity among the world's banking elite. The accelerating FOMO to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs for giants like Morgan Stanley further validates Bitcoin's promise. Other wealth managers will likely quickly follow their lead. As game theory takes hold, Bitcoin's march towards the mainstream financial system gains irresistible momentum. Significant bank adoption may be closer than many imagine.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1b0","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/debt-from-above-the-carbon-credit-coup","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/debt-from-above-the-carbon-credit-coup","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Debt From Above: The Carbon Credit Coup","author":"Whitney Webb","creation_date":"2024-04-04T19:35:04Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NDg4NDI4NzMxNjA2MjIx/debt_from_above_uhxbm_article_preview.jpg","article_summary":"Latin America is quietly being forced into a carbon market scheme through regional contractual obligations – enforced by the satellites of a US intelligence-linked firm – which seeks to create an inter-continental \"smart grid,\" erode national and local sovereignty, and link carbon-based life to the debt-based monetary system via a Bitcoin sidechain.","article_detailed_content":"Sweeping across the shores of Latin America comes a scheme from some of the most predatory figures in the venture capital ecosystem of the United States. It is a brazen attempt to assert foreign influence across Latin America and threatens to reshape the very fabric of the region and the day to day lives of its people. At its core is a serpentine set of contractual obligations, held at the municipal level, cast throughout Central and South America, upheld by an intelligence-linked satellite company, and controlled by a private sector consortium of green-washed financiers aiming to turn the region’s forests into equity and carbon credits. At the same time, it obliges local governments to spend “conservation” funds on projects that further financialize nature and aid the construction of an inter-continental “smart” grid. One of its key ambitions appears to be further entrenching the debt load of the region through the multi-lateral development banks and the dollarization of the continent from the subnational level up through carbon markets upheld by a digital ledger. What seems like a technological marvel aimed at progress and connectivity harbors a darker agenda — one that intertwines planetary surveillance, financial predation, geopolitical maneuvering, and the domination of a resource-rich continent buried in debt. This grand design, known by the acronym GREEN+ and conceived by stalwarts of the digital dollar and debt schemes of the private sector, has quietly taken root through a web of political entanglements at the local level. Even a key figure in the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal plays a role. Astonishingly, every capital city of Latin America has eagerly signed on, apparently unaware of the strings attached to these seemingly benign partnerships, while a majority of municipalities in the region have also made commitments with these same groups that will push them to join GREEN+, potentially in a matter of weeks. The (hopefully) well-meaning regional governments have unwittingly paved the way for a sweeping surveillance apparatus tied to American intelligence that threatens to erode privacy and civil liberties under the guise of progress and combating the climate crisis. Upon further observation, GREEN+'s connections reveal a disturbing narrative of financial interests melding with geopolitical ambitions. The backers of the satellite company share ties with former members of the highest offices of US financial policy and regulation alongside the key architects and profiteers of private capital creation, aiming to consolidate control over monetary flows in Latin America within the redistribution of distressed government debt from the public to the private sector. As this two-part series will show, this concerted effort is not merely about surveillance – it's a calculated move towards further dollarization, tightening the grip of corporate and technological monopolies over the economic landscape of the Americas. The scheme's proponents also speak of how it will significantly advance the \"economic\" and \"regional\" integration of the Americas, invoking visions of unity while obscuring the true nature of their agenda for economic domination and stronger regional governance. Their model, eerily reminiscent of the EU's transition from a free trade union to a bureaucratic behemoth yoked to the US through the Eurodollar, sets the stage for unelected entities to enforce policies through programmable money, enabled by smart contracts on blockchains and designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. What materializes before us is not just a technological evolution but a quiet banker coup — one that lays the groundwork for land grabs and invasive surveillance under the guise of progress and conservation. It's a narrative that echoes throughout history, where intelligence-linked figures and predatory financial interests converge to prey upon the Global South, leaving a trail of economic exploitation and geopolitical manipulation in their wake. What masquerades as progress for individuals and the environment at large may very well be the harbinger of a new era of subjugation and control. GREEN+ The GREEN+ Program In 2022, several groups came together to launch the GREEN+ (Government Reduction of Emissions for Environmental Net + Gain) Jurisdictional Programme, the “first program that will monitor by satellite all subnational protected areas of the planet” and – through contracts with numerous local and state governments – propel and deepen the economic integration of the Americas through the quiet imposition of a continent-wide, blockchain-based carbon market. GREEN+ has been piloted in a handful of Latin American cities since its founding and is due to launch globally in just a few weeks time. Most of the GREEN+ agreements with “subnational” governments have remained focused on Latin America. Per the program, the subnational agreements have established the “rules and requirements to enable accounting and crediting with GREEN+ policies and measures and/or nested projects, implemented as GHG mitigation activities,” with GREEN+ being described as “the planet's new subnational government advisory mechanism.” Key to the program are the services provided by GREEN+ founding member Satellogic, an Argentina-founded company closely aligned with Peter Thiel’s Palantir and Elon Musk’s SpaceX that specializes in sub-meter resolution satellite surveillance. Satellogic, a contractor to the US government and whose founders were also previously contactors for the US’ DHS, NSA and DARPA, will provide surveillance data of the entire world’s “protected areas” to GREEN+’s governing coalition, composed of the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network, The Energy Coalition and other “respected stakeholders.” According to the press release that details Satellogic’s alliance with GREEN+, the satellite surveillance data “will enable individuals, organizations, and global markets to accurately monitor the compliance of signatory jurisdictions to avoid deforestation.” However, other information in the press release reveals that forests will actually be monitored for the purpose of generating “credible” carbon credits to be traded on exchanges by GREEN+ on behalf of subnational governments. The press release also states that the GREEN+ alliance with Satellogic will “advance the future measurement of energy emissions in the most populated areas of the planet,” i.e. the surveillance of carbon emissions from space. Satellogic launched some GREEN+-affiliated satellites in 2022 as part of its pilot and is due to launch the remainder this April during Miami Climate Week. Satellogic’s past and upcoming launches of GREEN+ satellites were/will be conducted in collaboration with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, also a contractor to the US military and US intelligence agencies. Satellogic and GREEN+ Though framed as a way to develop economic incentives to mitigate climate change, the program is based on California’s controversial and grift-prone cap and trade program and has been created (and is being implemented by) individuals and companies that are seeking to covertly dollarize Latin America and/or have deep ties to US intelligence. Its ultimate ambitions go far beyond carbon markets and seek to use satellite surveillance to enforce carbon emission levels in both urban and rural areas. It also seeks to impose a new financial system centered around energy, commodity, and natural resource “credits” that are underpinned by extensive and invasive surveillance, underscored by the motto: “Earth observation is preservation.” The alliance that created GREEN+ includes the NGOs CC35, the Global Footprint Network (GFN), Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Catalytic Finance Foundation (CFF, formerly R20) and The Energy Coalition (TEC); the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas; the global insurance giant Lockton; the satellite company Satellogic; the “green” blockchain company EcoRegistry; the dominant carbon credit certifier in Latin America, Cercarbono; and Rootstock (RSK), the bitcoin side-chain protocol responsible for “smart BTC.” Several members of the alliance, though how many is unclear, now operate as part of a consortium linked to a company called Global Carbon Parks, which is discussed in greater detail later in this article and now manages major aspects of GREEN+. The NGOs (i.e. CC35, GFN, CFF and TEC) involved in founding GREEN+ are those who actually govern the GREEN+ program from California. As previously mentioned, the program takes carbon in “effectively conserved protected areas of a sub-national jurisdiction”, i.e. a city, county, province, or state/region, and converts them into carbon credits. Per the program, “these credits are traded on the [carbon] offset market, and income is deposited in a trust fund” that is controlled by GREEN+ and is known as the GREEN+ Trust. That trust is run by unspecified individuals who work for Lockton, Isolas and Rootstock. Alejandro Guerrero, head of Lockton’s Argentina & Uruguay branch, is the only publicly acknowledged member of the trust. Another website tied to the GREEN+ initiative describes the initial process as follows: Public and private agreements between [a subnational] government and custodians are signed with zero upfront cost. Custodians trade the carbon units that are produced by the subnational governments (the public sector) signing contracts with the private sector in voluntary carbon markets. Those contracts signed by the subnational governments become smart contracts and carbon credits are then tokenized for traceability. The GREEN+ Trust holds government funds in escrow. Subsequently, “a partial release of trust funds is made periodically during the crediting period of the jurisdictional initiative.” From this “partial release,” “a percentage operational fee” is deducted (the percentage is undisclosed in the program’s documents) and paid to the GREEN+ program while a separate (and also undisclosed) fee is also deducted “for the operation of the GREEN+ Trust.” Disbursements of what remains are made annually over a ten year period and, per graphs produced by GREEN+, those payments remain the same, fixed value even if the value of the carbon credits of the protected areas grows. From GREEN+ Between 40% and 60% of the funds actually received by subnational governments can be used to “design and execute projects” aimed at conservation, while the rest “is allocated for new jurisdictional decarbonisation initiatives” that can produce additional or “consequential” carbon credits. These “consequential” credits are then “offered as a preferred option to the investors who initially purchased the conservation credits at a 50% discounted price calculated at the current market price.” However, later in the same document, the program says that “the amount required for the initial implementation” of conservation projects “may not exceed 20% of the funds allocated [from the GREEN+ Trust] to the jurisdictional initiative.” Clearly, the amount of funds actually being generated for conservation-related projects is minimal and, even in the best case scenario, is less than half of the capital generated by the carbon credits themselves. However, as we shall see, these “conservation” projects must be done in conjunction with approved partners of Global Carbon Parks, which – like the organization itself – are tied to predatory financial interests and oligarchs with questionable motives. Of the funds that governments actually receive as part of GREEN+, half are officially meant to go toward conservation-related projects while the other half are meant to go toward decarbonization-related projects. However, on the Global Carbon Parks-GREEN+ website, it notes that the decarbonization projects must be conducted alongside Community Electricity, which forms part of Global Carbon Parks and is closely connected to the GREEN+ alliance member The Energy Coalition (TEC). As will be discussed later, TEC and Community Electricity are together attempting to build an inter-continental “smart” grid in the Americas and are also involved in efforts to develop “smart” cities and suburbs. As for GREEN+’s conservation projects, the website states that “50% of the resources received by the capital [city as part of GREEN+] must be used for social and environmental impact in protected urban areas with partners such as Cities4Forests.” Cities4Forests was founded by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a World Economic Forum affiliate and contractor to suspected CIA front USAID that is focused on resource “sustainability.” WRI is funded by the US and several European governments, billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mike Bloomberg as well as Google, Meta/Facebook, the Soros family’s Open Societies Foundations, the UN, Walmart, the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, among others. WRI’s Cities4Forests shares many of the same funding sources, such as the governments of the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US as well as the World Bank and the Caterpillar Foundation. Other funders include the Wall Street giant Citi Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Notably, the Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB recently teamed up to create the Intrinsic Exchange Group, which has spearheaded the financialization of nature via the creation of Natural Asset Corporations (NACs). As Unlimited Hangout previously reported, NACs create corporations that take control of natural assets that were previously part of the “commons,\" such as forests, rivers and lakes, and then sell shares of those assets to Wall Street asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and other financial institutions in order to generate profit under the guise of “conserving” the asset they target. From GREEN+ Unsurprisingly, most of Cities4Forests’ projects, such as those that would be built with GREEN+ funds, are similar to NACs in that they focus on using natural assets and “natural capital” to produce new financial and insurance products. Examples of Cities4Forests “conservation” projects include the development of a Forest Resilience Bond and the India Forum for Nature-based Solutions. One of the India-based forum’s “core partners” is the Nature Conservancy, which has been run by Wall Street bankers for years and has pioneered the modern iteration of the controversial “debt for conservation” swap among other “nature-based solutions.” The funders of Cities4Forest and its creator the WRI are also deeply affiliated with groups like the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and UN-backed climate finance initiatives that openly seek to use debt imperialism to herd the global economy, with a focus on emerging markets, into a new system of global financial governance. Thus, the “conservation” and “decarbonization” efforts that subnational governments must enact as part of their contractual agreements with GREEN+ will go towards projects tied to either the smart grid/smart city developer Community Electricity or a “conservation” organization backed by Western oligarchs, multi-national corporations and banks that seeks to financialize and monetize nature under the guise of conserving it. CC35 and the Subnational Pivot CC35, or Ciudades Capitales de las Americas frente al Cambio Climático (American Capital Cities Facing Climate Change), is the most visible organization behind the GREEN+ program and one of the members of its governance committee. CC35’s goal is the economic integration of the Americas (North, South and Central) through coordinated climate change policies, specifically the creation of an Inter-American carbon market, with GREEN+ being the means of implementing that market. The group focuses on “subnational” governments, namely capital cities of the Americas, thereby circumventing national governments with respect to Climate Change-related policy. Regarding GREEN+, Sebastián Navarro, the secretary general of CC35, stated of the program that: “We will be relentless from the governance of the GREEN+ program with those who want to continue playing with the future of humanity,” adding that their “relentless” approach would be greatly aided by Satellogic’s satellite surveillance capabilities, which would also “generate unprecedented credibility among investors of the carbon credits produced by conservation.” Navarro’s promise to be “relentless” in governing a satellite surveillance regime of American forests for the purpose of producing “high-credibility” carbon markets. Sebastián Navarro of CC35 While framed as an initiative “born out of Latin America,” CC35 is registered in Miami; Florida (Coral Gables, specifically) and has long been funded and partnered with US-based interests. For instance, CC35’s first partners were R20 (Regions of Climate Action, now the Catalytic Finance Foundation), a group created by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in partnership with the UN, and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. From there, CC35 partnered with UN and UN-linked organizations as well as Pegasus Capital Advisors, which also finances CC35 and Schwarzenegger’s R20/Catalytic Finance Foundation. R20/Catalytic Finance, like CC35, focuses its attention on “subnational” governments. Pegasus Capital is the firm created by Craig Cogut, a key figure in the “junk bond” financial scandal at the now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert. Drexel’s junk bond department, led by Michael Milken, engaged in blatantly illegal activity and used junk bonds to help fuel the takeovers of major corporations by the era’s infamous “corporate raiders” before the bank’s collapse. Specifically, Cogut was the lawyer who advised the Milken-run and scandal-ridden junk bond department on the legality of transactions, including those that saw Milken become a convicted felon. Following Drexel’s collapse, Cogut teamed up with a group of Drexel alumni led by Leon Black – now best known for his close association with the deceased sex trafficker and \"financial adviser\" Jeffrey Epstein – to co-found Apollo Advisers (now Apollo Global Management) in 1990. Cogut left Apollo to found Pegasus in 1996 and Pegasus has since became a key player in several UN-supported “green” finance initiatives. Cogut is also financially entangled with Satellogic’s co-founder, Emiliano Kargieman, as will be discussed later. Cogut subsequently became a board member of Arizona State University’s Global Institute of Sustainability, which was created by Michael Crow (and who served on the board alongside Cogut). Crow is chairman of the board of trustees In-Q-tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Cogut also served on the board of ASU’S McCain Institute, named for the late Senator John McCain, which has links to Ashton Kutcher’s CIA-linked charity Thorn. Current board members of the McCain Institute include both Crow and former CIA director David Petraeus on its board, as well as Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who co-created the Council for Inclusive Capital with the Vatican. Cogut was also on the board of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), part of the Clinton family philanthropies, and CHAI was largely shaped and influenced by notorious sex trafficker and “financial advisor for billionaires” Jeffrey Epstein, having been the chief reason for former president Bill Clinton’s flights on Epstein’s plane in the early 2000s. Notably, Cogut is not the only Drexel alum to be involved in “green finance.” The field of “green finance” itself was essentially invented by Richard Sandor, who made millions at Drexel during the 1980s, pioneering “innovative” products like the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), which would later contribute to the 2008 financial crisis. Sandor had previously been deemed the “father of financial futures” and is also credited with helping create derivatives. After Drexel’s collapse, Sandor moved on to pioneering carbon emissions trading and carbon markets with the vision of creating “an all-electronic exchange for carbon trading,” a vision that has since taken shape. Craig Cogut of Pegasus Capital CC35 has long been led by Sebastián Navarro. Under his leadership, CC35 helped broker the creation of the Subnational Climate Fund, which is backed by Cogut’s Pegasus Capital along with BNP Paribas, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bloomberg Philanthropies and the governments of Germany, the UK, Australia and the Netherlands. That fund focuses on financing infrastructure projects in the Global South at the subnational (e.g. city, state) level, again bypassing national governments. Indeed, the main modus operandi of CC35 is brokering contracts between small, subnational governments and “green” finance entities that are tied to centers of US/European political or financial power. Navarro is listed as a director of CC35 as are two prominent, right-leaning Latin American politicians: Felipe Alessandri Vergara, mayor of the Chilean capital Santiago from 2016 to 2021, and Nasry Asfura Zablah, former mayor of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and former Honduran presidential candidate. Alessandri is a well-known figure in Chilean center-right politics and an ally of the recently deceased former Chilean president Sebastián Piñera. Alessandri is controversial within the Chilean right for his covert support of initiatives generally favored by the left and publicly shunned by his party while serving as Santiago’s mayor, such as climate finance/regional economic integration (via CC35) and his financing of initiatives related to illegal immigration. Alessandri’s successor and supposed political nemesis, Irací Hassler of Chile’s Communist Party, has since taken over for Alessandri as CC35’s Vice President for South America. As for Nasry Asfura, he was the subject of a Honduran political scandal due to his appearance in the Pandora Papers and his alleged involvement in suspicious offshore finance activities. He was also indicted on money laundering and fund embezzlement, but charges were dropped under Asfura’s successor Jorge Aldana, who is now president of CC35. The current vice president of CC35 for Central America is Mario Durán, the mayor of San Salvador and a close ally of El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele as well as a member of Bukele’s Nuevas Ideas party. Durán is poised to take over the leadership of CC35 per a recent announcement from the group. In 2021, Durán signed a contract with CC35 regarding education about the use of Bitcoin in all metropolitan region municipalities in El Salvador, and is the only mention of CC35 promoting the use of Bitcoin. As will be noted again later on, the CC35-led GREEN+ initiative is partnered with Rootstock, which created and develops a Bitcoin sidechain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presumably, the goal is to run GREEN+’s digital carbon market on the same blockchain. While it may seem odd to an American audience that “regional integration” efforts under the guise of climate change would be led largely by right-leaning politicians, it is important to point out that such integration efforts have historically been led by both left and right factions in Latin America, who compete for dominance over the region. For instance, right-leaning efforts at economically and/or politically integrating the Americas include Mercosur (the Southern Common Market, now championed by the “anti-globalist” Javier Milei) and Prosur (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America, launched by Chile’s center-right Piñera). Left-leaning efforts include ALADI (Latin American Integration Association) and UNASUR (Union of South American Nations). All of these efforts have failed due to geopolitical disagreements mainly centered around whether to grant membership to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and others with governments estranged from the so-called “Washington consensus” or, more recently, efforts to forge closer ties to Russia and/or China. Given that several important Latin American countries can suddenly change what side of the “consensus” they are on depending on presidential election results, such as recently happened in Brazil and Argentina, these regional integration efforts have failed to gain significant traction over the last several decades. Nevertheless, the end goal of economic integration begetting political integration remains the same. Thus, as CC35 shows, the push to regionally integrate Latin America has now, very quietly, pivoted away from engagement at the national level to the subnational level. Aurelio Peccei at the 3rd Annual WWF Congress in 1973 The Club of Rome’s Global Footprint While CC35 is the most visible face of GREEN+’s governing body, it is actually chaired by a group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN). The GFN exists to promote “the Ecological Footprint, which tracks how much nature we use and how much we have, as an accounting tool” for green finance initiatives and originated the concept of “ecological debt” based on that metric. Elsewhere, the GFN calls for “one-planet prosperity” and emphasizes climate finance, a field dominated by predatory Wall Street banks and billionaires, as an economic imperative. They work with governments at both the national and subnational level and establish the carbon emissions limits for localities, states and countries that programs like GREEN+ seek to enforce with satellite surveillance and binding contractual obligations. The GFN is intimately connected to the Club of Rome. For instance, GFN’s founder and a member of its board, Mathis Wackernagel, who also co-created the Ecological Footprint concept, is a member of the Club of Rome. Wackernagel’s former mentor and the other developer of the Ecological Footprint, William Rees, was a member of the Club of Rome until 2018. Heiko Specking, a GFN board member, is also affiliated with the Club of Rome as is another GFN board member, Lewis Akenji. The Club of Rome was founded in 1968 by the Italian industrialist Aurelio Peccei and Scottish chemist Alexander King. Its earliest success was the 1972 report and later book “The Limits to Growth,\" which was based on an MIT study and claimed that “if the world’s consumption patterns and population growth continued at the same high rates of the time, the earth would strike its limits within a century.” The book was heavily promoted by the earliest annual meetings of the World Economic Forum, particularly in 1973. Peccei, who spent a large part of his life living in Argentina, had previously been a member of ADELA, the Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America. ADELA was composed of powerful Western companies that pooled money to invest in Latin American companies of their choosing, essentially “king-making” the titans of the Latin American corporate world. ADELA’s backers included Bank of America, IBM, Fiat (where Peccei was an executive), and the Rockefeller family’s Standard Oil. The group was part of the Rockefeller-dominated network in Latin America, which also included the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), which has been linked to the 1973 CIA-backed military coup in Chile through the Chilean Rockefeller associate Agustín Edwards, and Deltec, best known today as a main bank for the failed crypto exchange FTX and its close relationship with the stablecoin Tether. Modern iterations of this network include Endeavor and the Council of the Americas (CoA), which will be discussed in the second part of this series. Notably, it was Peccei’s speech at an ADELA conference that spurred his partnership with Alexander King and led to the Club of Rome’s formation. At the time he got involved with Peccei and made the Club of Rome, King was head of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD was originally established as the OEEC to help administer the post-WWII, US-developed Marshall Plan and was later expanded to become a global organization in 1961. The US remains the OECD’s main funder by a significant margin. The group has long claimed to promote “sustainable economic growth” and “consistently improving standard of living in its member countries,” but – in practice – it routinely favors neoliberal policies that enrich Western-based multi-national corporations. It is closely partnered with entities like the IMF, the World Bank and the broader multi-lateral development banking system that has used debt slavery sold as “economic development” to privatize state-owned assets and sell them off to privileged corporate interests. That system has also been considered by the US military to be part of its arsenal of “financial weapons” used to protect US interests abroad. The Club of Rome was criticized for many decades for embracing neo-Malthusian thought (i.e. eugenics and specifically population control measures in the developing world) as well as for promoting greater global governance. Some of its members have championed the imposition of a “benevolent” global dictatorship. Criticisms of the Club of Rome have been voiced by academia as well as independent and mainstream media. The group’s attempt to rebrand as an environmental group in order to gain popular support for those same policies was discussed in their 1991 book “The First Global Revolution,” which states: “In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together. But in designating these dangers as the enemy, we fall into the trap, which we have already warned readers about, namely mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention in natural processes, and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome. The real enemy then is humanity itself.” The Global Footprint Network’s methods, products and ideology are very much aligned with the neo-Malthusian “Limits to Growth” view of the Club of Rome as well as the efforts to incorporate nature into financial markets via so-called “nature-based solutions.” Indeed, the GFN’s ecological footprint metric is promoted by groups like the World Economic Forum and the World Wildlife Fund (where Peccei served on the board and which has long been tied to European oligarch and corporate interests). GFN also provides the statistical means of imposing Limits to Growth-style models that control both population levels and industrialization levels on governments by developing “ecological budgets” that, as evidenced by GREEN+, are now interfacing directly with carbon markets. Building a “GREEN” Power Monopoly The other member of the GREEN+ governing committee that will control the program as well as Satellogic’s surveillance data is The Energy Coalition (TEC). Notably, it was TEC’s executive director Craig Perkins who said that GREEN+ would also enable the surveillance of carbon emissions of populated areas, presumably via satellite. TEC was founded by John Phillips, who ran Phillips Energy – an oil and gas company, in 1975. Since 1979, it has been closely partnered with local California governments via its Community Energy Partnership program. Currently, TEC is partnered with, and some of its key initiatives are financed by, major California gas companies, referred to by TEC as California’s “investor-owned utilities.” These include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, SDGE and SoCalGas. With the backing of these major oil and gas companies, TEC assures us it is “creating the building blocks for a new energy economy.” One of its main partners in doing so is Community Electricity, which claims to be “building the NASDAQ of the clean energy field.” TEC and Community Electricity, which is backed by Google, have co-designed “a master plan” financed by the California Energy Commission “to implement the largest and first-of-its-kind decarbonization by electrification protocols using DERs [distributed energy resources], carbon emissions management, blockchain, AI and IoT [internet of things] all connected under one plug-and-play platform.” Community Electric designs, funds and develops this technology for GluHomes (formerly GluEnergy), its parent company which shares the same founder as Community Electricity – Felipe Cano. The program is being piloted in the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles as well as in disadvantaged communities in Colombia. The goal, per Cano, is to “bring the Americas together” through an inter-continental, “clean” smart grid. Helena Donoso, Samuel Garcia, Felipe Cano, Santiago F. Maldonado, and Sebastian Navarro The blockchain involved in these efforts is RSK, the smart contract-oriented sidechain that runs on top of the Bitcoin network. As previously mentioned, RSK is a founding member of GREEN+. The initiative involving TEC, Community Electricity, California’s government, and RSK also seeks “to digitize carbon credit reporting” and to “create opportunities for businesses to redeem credits.” The Community Electricity/TEC program also uses the RSK blockchain to record a person’s energy usage “with the help of RIF, an identity product [i.e. digital identity] developed by RSK Labs.” The Community Electricity system requires a digital ID tied to a digital wallet that “is embedded to store daily profits derived from surplus energy sales” that allow electricity consumers to trade energy credits and become what the company calls “prosumers,” with the goal of creating “an energy social network.” The Community Electricity hardware produced with GluHomes also “utilize[s] AI and machine learning to transform any home intro a smart micro electricity generation utility.” The group is partnering with real estate developers to develop smart homes connected to their energy-related technology, with a focus on social housing and affordable housing, i.e. housing for lower income families. The goal is to connect together retro-fitted existing homes, new smart homes, a neighborhood co-op of electric vehicles and a reward-payment system called GluPay, which is partnered with Mastercard and Contigo, which designs products “for the unbanked, immigrants, homeless and disadvantaged population,” with a focus on remittance payments. Contigo is currently in talks with El Salvador’s government to have the company’s “Payments Wallet tied into the Salvadoran financial inclusion products.” Contigo is run by Raul Hinojosa, an academic at UCLA who wrote a book entitled “Convergence and Divergence between NAFTA, Chile, and MERCOSUR: Overcoming Dilemmas of North and South American Economic Integration,” which focuses on “the impact of a potential Free Trade of the Americas Agreement.” The creator of Community Electricity and GluHomes, Felipe Cano has also spent most of his career attempting to economically integrate large swathes of the world. For instance, in 1998, his vision was “to unify both European and US stock exchanges under one platform and protocol, the create the smart grid of the equity market and stock trading in a bilateral, single network.” This vision led him to create ECN Access, which “was the first tech hub in Europe to route the first block of institutional order flows from a European Bank directly to the NASDAQ electronic exchange without intermediaries,” creating what Cano calls “the first smart grid every built.” He then sought to “create a digital market for the energy sector,” which has since culminated in his creation of Community Electricity and GluHomes. Cano is an adviser to TEC and is also a senior partner at Silverbear Capital, where he focuses on investments related to smart cities. According to his bio at Silverbear, Cano is also CEO of “Olidata Smart Cities LLC, a market-maker platform which uses nano-grids and microgrids as the underlying strategy to deploy the Internet of Things Protocol of the future.” Cano was also, until recently, the president of Global Carbon Parks, which is a consortium of companies, the only known members of which all happen to be companies that founded GREEN+, with the one exception being Cano’s Community Electricity. Global Carbon Parks, unsurprisingly, is now one of the main implementers of the GREEN+ program. Global Carbon Parks is also partnered with Aclima, a start-up backed by Microsoft and the foundation of former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Global Carbon Park’s stated mission is to “transform protected areas into natural equity” via public-private partnerships, essentially admitting that the GREEN+ program it now helps manage is about financializing protected natural assets and resources. Felipe Cano - GluHomes Inc Global Carbon Parks “transforms” these forests into “natural equity” by measuring, certifying and trading carbon credits in conjunction with the carbon credit certification Cercarbono (discussed later in this article). Their partnership with Satellogic, which goes beyond but also includes the GREEN+ program, uses satellite surveillance “to ensure the integrity of the preserved area” which contains the carbon represented by the carbon credits. The company also promotes their integration with The Energy Coalition and Community Electricity to develop “advanced electricity communities” that develop “renewable energy credits,\" which the company claims will “contribute to local wealth creation.” The company is partnered with a financial firm, which does the actual trading of carbon credits for both Global Carbon Parks and presumably GREEN+. However, Global Carbon Parks declines to reveal their identity, merely stating that “They are a financial firm that integrates technical, economic, and environmental solutions.” In summary, the governance of the GREEN+ program and the group with control over its satellite surveillance data; are tied to or funded by groups that have long used debt as a form of control over the Global South in particular; seek to control the population size and the degree of industrialization in countries; are tied to globalist efforts to economically and politically integrate the Americas; are building a Bitcoin blockchain-based smart grid that surveils and limits energy usage and links energy usage to currency; and are integrating and tokenizing the natural world, including endangered or protected areas, into the financial system under the guise of conservation. Through CC35’s Alcades por el Clima (Mayors for the Climate) initiative, over 15,000 local governments in Latin America have signed agreements with CC35 related to carbon emission trading schemes and limits, led by Brazil (5,564 local governments), Argentina (2,457 local governments), and Mexico (2,481 local governments). Presumably, those carbon neutrality/trading agreements will allow CC35 to push those municipalities into the GREEN+ program, if they aren’t already planning to participate directly (many are). In other words, the vast majority of Latin America, unbeknownst to the vast majority of its populace, is already contractually yoked to one of the main organizations behind the GREEN+ program – run by interests tied to foreign banks, corporations and even intelligence services. The program is set to launch continent-wide in a matter of weeks. As this article and subsequent article will show, what has transpired is a brazen attempt to conduct a silent coup of the continent’s natural resources, energy production, local governments and economy. The GREEN+ Trust and the Bitcoin Carbon Market The GREEN+ Trust, which is to hold and handle the profits from the carbon credits produced and then disburse them to governments if certain conditions are met, is to be managed by individuals “selected from the members institutions of the [GREEN+] Executive Board” as well as from Isolas, Lockton and Rootstock (RSK). According to GREEN+, the Trust is not only responsible for fund custody, but also “the regulation of smart contracts, in coordination with the certification standard [Cercarbono] and the monitoring of mitigation initiatives [conducted by Satellogic].” The only known member of the Trust, as previously mentioned, is Alejandro Guerrero, the head of Lockton’s branch in Argentina and Uruguay. Lockton, a founding member of GREEN+ and also of Global Carbon Parks, is the world’s largest, privately held insurance brokerage firm that also provides risk management services, employee benefits and retirement services. They are owned by the Lockton family and the company – and the family behind it – are rather secretive. However, the company has been overt about the opportunities they see in the type of carbon market that initiatives like GREEN+ will create. In a 2023 article, Lockton’s head of Digital Integration and Special Projects, David Briscoe, wrote that making carbon credits “a stable and trusted currency” would “require the support of the insurance market.” This is because, as Briscoe notes, “voluntary” carbon markets come with risks, particularly because “of the financial values involved.” Per Briscoe, these risks include “non- or under-delivery of forward purchased carbon removal credits,\" “start-ups involved in the voluntary carbon market may face insolvency risks,” and “fraud and negligence.” Indeed, mismanagement and fraud has been a major driver of why carbon markets have failed to catch on despite relentless promotion and the adoption of ESG and climate change plans by many of the most powerful names in finance and industry. Instead of addressing the rampant fraud in carbon credits directly, it appears that the high probability of fraud and insolvency has been seen as an opportunity to create a new market for the insurance industry, with carbon credit insurance being framed as the only “feasible” means of de-risking the fraud-prone world of carbon markets, which have been criticized by environmental groups and have been shown to have a negligible impact on climate. Lockton offers a variety of products related to carbon credits and so do its competitors, with the first such insurance having been issued by the UK-based insurance company Howden in 2022. That product was designed to “increase confidence in the Voluntary Carbon Market” and was “incubated” in collaboration with “the Insurance Task Force of the Sustainable Markets Initiative; an initiative led by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales [now King Charles].” Industry publications have openly posited that carbon credits are likely to be “the next $1 billion insurance market.” Some companies, like Kita and Oka, were created specifically to insure carbon credits. Presumably, Lockton’s involvement with GREEN+ means that Lockton will be insuring the mass of carbon credits to be produced by the program, which plans to harvest carbon credits from all of the world’s “subnational protected areas.” In addition, Lockton’s role as the carbon credits insurer means it will be involved in ensuring that those cities/regions that are to become part of GREEN+ comply with the program’s stipulations in order to receive funds from the trust. RootstockLabs (RSK) Another member of the GREEN+ Trust is RSK, or Rootstock. RSK is a federated sidechain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that allows smart contract functionality akin to the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the same programming language known as Solidity. In effect, this means that any smart contract that can be designed and authored on Ethereum, such as identity systems, dollar-pegged stablecoins, or tokenized carbon credits, can be “trivially” ported to Bitcoin. The concept of Bitcoin sidechains was first introduced in October 2014 by a group of Bitcoin developers mainly employed by Blockstream, whose November 2014 seed round was led by Reid Hoffman, that gives “bitcoins and other ledger assets” the ability to be “transferred between multiple blockchains” giving new functionality to “assets they already own” without compromising any of the security innate to Bitcoin's blockchain. RSK works by allowing users to deposit funds sent using traditional bitcoin transactions into a wallet controlled by a federation (in this case, a known group of Rootstock-selected key signers) that issues a 1:1 token called Smart Bitcoin, represented by RBTC, which fuels the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine), a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). RBTC is “the native currency” of Rootstock, and is used to pay for the fees required to complete and settle the smart contracts or transactions that take place on the RSK sidechain. RSK was launched in 2015 by RSK Labs, which was acquired by RIF Labs before becoming IOV (“internet of value”) Labs. IOV labs, as of last week, has rebranded once again to become RootstockLabs. It was co-founded by Sergio Lerner, who became the Bitcoin Foundation’s bitcoin core security auditor the same year he conceived of RSK, and Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. Gutierrez is the current chairman of RootstockLabs, while Lerner is its chief scientist and they are the president and vice president, respectively, of the IOV Foundation, which enables “interventions that contribute to sustainable development,\" specifically the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on emerging markets and territories. A major goal of the SDGs is to create a new global financial governance system. That system has been described in recent years by top UN climate finance official, central banker, and ex-Goldman Sachs executive Mark Carney, as relying largely on programmable, surveillable digital currencies (namely central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs) and a global carbon market. According to RootstockLabs and its affiliated foundation, the group’s mission is to harness “the power of digital technology, blockchain, and collaboration” to “break down barriers and create a more equitable society.” They also state that Rootstock Labs was created with the intent of creating “a new open financial ecosystem,” while RIF Labs states it (along with RootstockLabs) is “creating a global financial system that works for everyone.” Wences Casares - July 2018 Diego Gutierrez is a long-time associate of Wenceslao (Wences) Casares, an Argentine tech entrepreneur sometimes referred to as the “Peter Thiel of Latin America.” Gutierrez worked with Casares at Argentina’s first Internet service provider, which Casares had launched, and then helped create the Casares-founded Argentinian online brokerage firm Patagon that was later sold to Spanish banking giant Santander. Casares, like Gutierrez, is a long-time promoter and early adopter of Bitcoin and is allegedly responsible for pitching the promise of Bitcoin to elites, like Bill Gates and LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman. Hoffman once referred to Casares as Bitcoin’s “patient zero” in terms of Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin. Forbes has even referred to Casares as “crypto royalty who ran with the original gang of Bitcoin OGs.” Casares subsequently became a board member of PayPal and also part of Facebook’s failed stablecoin project Libra/Diem. He is also a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader. Casares was formerly a partner at NXTP Ventures, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Latin America, and he is credited with introducing the firm’s founders to crypto. NXTP subsequently became a major investor in Gutierrez’s RSK as well as another Gutierrez-founded company, Koibanx, a Latin America-focused asset tokenization company that – per its CEO – is at the “forefront of redefining Latin America’s financial system.” Gutierrez’s Koibanx has been instrumental in developing Bitcoin products and services sponsored by El Salvador’s government as well as enabling the role of Algorand as an intermediary in El Salvador’s Bitcoin ecosystem. Algorand is also a major investor in Koibanx and is currently run by Staci Warden, who aided the cronyist privatization of Russia while at Harvard, oversaw J.P. Morgan’s division of emerging market government debt and led crypto-related initiatives and “global market development” for the Institute of the mastermind of the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond scandal, Michael Milken. Gutierrez’s Koibanx has also launched a blockchain-based digital ID in Colombia with over 12 million users and is partnered with Nigeria’s government on a crypto initiative where Nigerians can exchange their intellectual property (IP) for a “stable token” considered “equivalent to the Naira,” Nigeria’s currency that has been completely taken over by the government’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. Both of those projects have also been conducted jointly with Algorand. Algorand is a member alongside PayPal and Amazon of the Digital Monetary Institute, which works with central banks, major commercial banks, and Big Tech firms to “examine the distribution and use cases of both retail and wholesale central bank digital currencies, tokenised assets, deposits and capital markets, cross-border payments and domestic interoperability.” The DMI also focuses on “crypto assets and stablecoins.” NXTP is also an investor in Ripio, an Argentina-based crypto firm partnered with the World Economic Forum. Rootstock co-founder Sergio Lerner sits on the board of Ripio’s P2P lending subsidiary, the Ripio Credit Network (RCN). Ripio is backed by Tim Draper, who is on the board of the Netanyahu family-founded crypto company Bancor, Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, and Argentina’s richest man Marcos Galperín. Galperín also sits on the board of GREEN+ partner and intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Galperín is intimately connected to the “emerging market” entrepreneurial network known as Endeavor, the board of which is chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr. and includes Reid Hoffman. Both the Bronfman family and Hoffman have considerable ties to sex trafficker and financial criminal Jeffrey Epstein. Wences Casares was previously on Endeavor’s board and still maintains ties with the group. Ripio is also an Endeavor-backed company. Marcos Galperin at the World Economic Forum Galperín’s company, Mercado Libre, is considered the first Endeavor success story, and Galperín sits on the board of Endeavor’s Argentina branch alongside controversial Argentinian oligarchs, like former George Soros protégé Eduardo Elzstain. Galperín’s Mercado Libre is deeply interconnected with PayPal as well as Paxos, the stablecoin issuer creating PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD. Mercado Libre’s Mercado Pago subsidiary, Ripio and Brazil’s Mercado Bitcoin (another Endeavor/Mercado Libre-connected company) collectively dominate crypto use in South America, especially its biggest markets – Argentina and Brazil. Diego Gutierrez’s RSK and Wences Casares’ Xapo, a crypto-focused bank founded in 2014 with a long-standing interest in Bitcoin and stablecoin providers, share a common tie in Joey Garcia, who is on the board of both companies. Garcia is also listed as being Xapo’s Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer. Garcia is a lawyer for and head of the fintech team at the Gibraltar-based law firm Isolas, which is also part of the GREEN+ group and manages the GREEN+ Trust alongside RSK and Lockton. Both Xapo and RSK’s parent, Rootstock Labs, are based in Gibraltar – a UK overseas territory, where Garcia helped develop and lobby for crypto regulations with hopes of having that regulatory regime influence coming regulations in the US and Europe. Garcia is also connected to UN initiatives on digital currencies, with a focus on regulation and law enforcement. The involvement of this network in GREEN+ speaks to an effort to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain in the creation of a new global financial system centered around digital currencies and carbon markets. As carbon markets have developed, it has become clear that the carbon market which central and commercial bankers wish to build (with UN backing) will be blockchain-based and that carbon credits will be tokenized and traded on digital exchanges, such as the Goldman Sachs and Blackstone-backed Xpansiv, which is partnered with GREEN+ members Cercarbono and EcoRegistry. There are efforts to make Bitcoin the blockchain on which these markets (or at least key parts of them) will run, hence the relatively recent effort to create a more “sustainable” and “net zero” Bitcoin. RSK is clearly part of this effort, as evidenced by their involvement in GREEN+, where they are managing the smart contracts of GREEN+ carbon credits, as well as their partnership with the California Energy Commission and GREEN+ member The Energy Coalition on creating “an experimental market for carbon credit trading” on top of Bitcoin. The importance of RSK within the maturation of the carbon credit market in the blockchain era is two-fold; the direct and immediate interoperability between tokenized assets representing green finance instruments and bitcoin, and the leveraging of the most distributed and most secure blockchain in the world, Bitcoin, as a universal ledger for the execution and settlement of otherwise impossible smart contracts. Rootstock allows Bitcoin the protocol to become the enabling and enforcing environment for all aspects of climate capitalism – green bond authoring and settlement, parametric insurance clauses, the tokenization of carbon emission offsets, and the issuance of dollar stablecoins that denominate the entire system and globalize the US Treasury market. Diego Gutierrez of RootstockLabs As recently mentioned, Diego Gutierrez of RSK was a very early adopter and promoter of Bitcoin and today runs Bitcoin Argentina while also being a co-founder of Latin America’s largest and oldest Bitcoin conference. In an interview with Argentinian outlet La Voz early last year, Gutierrez stated that, in order for Bitcoin to become part of the global financial system that is emerging, there would have to be a “trade off” that would mean stripping Bitcoin of its “ethos” and “part of its disruptive potential.” In other words, in Gutierrez’s view, Bitcoin must cease to be a threat to central and commercial banks as it integrates into the system those banks have designed and uphold and will become their tool. There is perhaps no greater evidence of this than the recent pivot of BlackRock’s Larry Fink on Bitcoin and its promise as a “technology for asset storage” and the wild success of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Gutierrez also tellingly stated in the same interview that there would soon be a move away from fiat and fiat-backed stablecoins to commodity-backed stablecoins that would make the companies and entities that control those commodities (which would include carbon in this emerging financial paradigm) more powerful than central banks and eliminate the need for central banks entirely. Wences Casares, Gutierrez's close associate, created his bank Xapo to help “solve the disjointed nature of our world economy” and to act as “the bridge between bitcoin, US dollars and stablecoins.” As a consequence, Xapo has been a key player in efforts to dollarize bitcoin and has developed close relationships with Circle (USDC), Tether (USDT) and Lightspark, whose founder David Marcus invested in Xapo while head of PayPal. Marcus also previously worked for Facebook and co-created Facebook’s Libra/Diem stablecoin project, where Casares was on the board and which was allied with Xapo. Xapo’s initial advisory board was composed of former longtime head of Citibank John Reed, Visa founder Dee Hock and former Treasury Secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. Summers is best known for his close association with Jeffrey Epstein and his role in repealing key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act at Citi’s behest, which is widely believed to have provoked the 2008 financial crisis. While on Xapo’s board, Summers became a leading voice behind the effort to “put a price on carbon” and implement carbon taxes and carbon markets. In 2015, together with these men, Xapo claimed, they would build “the global bitcoin ecosystem.” The GREEN+ Registry Working closely with the GREEN+ Trust is the carbon credit certification standard chosen by GREEN+, Cercarbono. In addition to certifying the carbon credits produced by the program, Cercarbono also has a role in choosing which initiatives participating jurisdictions can implement with funds received and are also involved in fund custody alongside the GREEN+ Trust. Cercarbono was launched in 2016, shortly after Colombia – where Cercarbono was formed – passed a law establishing a carbon tax. Cercarbono’s founders created the company because the law created a “need for a national certifying entity that would provide solutions to the climate problem.” Further Colombian legislation in 2017 spurred the company to expand into carbon markets. It has since become a leading voluntary carbon credit certifier in Latin America. In 2018, Cercarbono formed a partnership with EcoRegistry, a blockchain registry that is also part of GREEN+ and “develops services and platforms for reporting, monitoring and registering environmental assets and carbon units.” The program says the company also “addresses the issuance, monitoring and cancellation of the carbon credits generated by the jurisdictions in close coordination with the certification standard and the Trust Fund.” EcoRegistry provides a unique serial number to each carbon credit issued and allows for close monitoring of that credit on-chain. As a consequence, it works closely with the lead of GREEN+’s monitoring unit, the intelligence-linked satellite surveillance firm Satellogic. EcoRegistry is also a part of the Climate Action Data Trust, or CAD Trust. The CAD Trust was discussed in previous reporting from Bitcoin Magazine and Unlimited Hangout and is an effort led by the World Bank and funded by Google (among others) in an effort to construct what they refer to as “climate wallets.” IETA, discussed below, is also a member of the CAD Trust. Tokenized, Inc. The World Bank has been exploring tokenization and digital ledger technology in order to create “a modular and interoperable end-to-end digital ecosystem for the carbon market.” Through the Digital for Climate (D4C) working group, the World Bank aims to build “the next generation of climate markets” by directing governments to create National Carbon Registries reliant on blockchain technology. The data produced by these registries will be “link[ed], aggregat[ed] and harmoniz[ed]” by the CAD Trust. D4C itself leverages the Chia blockchain, developed by BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen. Part of the D4C’s “Climate Tokenization Suite” includes the aforementioned Climate Wallet to facilitate the exchange of carbon credit tokens, requiring an active connection to a Climate Action Data Trust node to function. EcoRegistry is also part of the Climate Chain Coalition, whose other members include disgraced WeWork CEO Adam Neumann’s new venture Flowcarbon, the Cardano Foundation, the Google-backed oracle service Chainlink, and the Sustainable Bitcoin Protocol (SBP), which seeks to “encourage [bitcoin] miners to utilize environmentally friendly energy sources using tokenization.” The SBP aims to turn “sustainability into an investable asset” when they create what they refer to as a Sustainable Bitcoin Certificate (SBC), a verified “on-chain environmental asset” representing “bitcoin mined using clean energy.” The SBP website further specifies the incentivized opportunity for additional revenue streams for Bitcoin miners, stating that “unlike carbon credits or RECs which are retired,\" each individual SBC is a tokenized asset which “permanently represents the sustainability of one bitcoin.” Due to an upcoming 50% reduction in the rate of bitcoin issued per block – referred to as a “halving” – alternative sources of income for miners can be the difference between thriving and barely surviving in such an unforgiving market. While initially issued alongside the mining of every new bitcoin, the SBC itself can later be sold to other investors. Depending on future regulations of energy in relation to Bitcoin mining operations in the United States, non-mining businesses might look to purchase these certificates from miners as a means to offset the carbon footprint of their bitcoin holdings. In effect, the SBP aims to incentivize carbon neutrality for Bitcoin miners while simultaneously allowing investors to meet ESG goals while holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, the latter exemplified in their partnership with Bitcoin custodian BitGo. Their website explains that they “believe Bitcoin has a unique potential to expedite the clean energy transition” and due to being “the world’s first commodity derived from a network,” every bitcoin mined is “fully fungible in both price and also carbon footprint” – culminating in a “sustainability opportunity unlike any other industry.\" If a large company with a large carbon output due in large part to the sheer energy demands of being a multi-national company – traveling employees, large scale data centers, and simply offices that require electricity – was holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, they could purchase large amounts of SBCs to source yield on the appreciating certificate token while also generating accounting opportunities to reach metric-based ESG goals faster. The co-founder of SBP, Matthew Twomey, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, OSL and Deutsche Bank, while Head of Climate Strategy Elliot David previously held positions at the US Department of Energy, as well as worked with the Clinton Foundation within their Clinton Climate Initiative on their Island Energy Program. Listed among the SBP Advisors are Natasha Barrientos (S&P Global and the United Nations), Dr. Julia Nesheiwat (the Atlantic Council), Emma Todd (World Economic Forum) and Kelvin Chang (Coinbase and Microsoft). Cercarbono and EcoRegistry share several noteworthy partners and affiliations. For example, both are members of Asocarbono, an alliance of different companies and actors running or supporting Colombian carbon markets, that has written about the issue of “carbon rights” within voluntary carbon markets. According to the UN, “carbon rights” “comprises two fundamental concepts: 1) the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc. and 2) the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights (i.e. through emissions trading schemes).” The issue itself portends the possibility that those who purchase carbon credits will obtain the “property rights” of the carbon sequestered in trees and other natural elements found in the area tied to those carbon credits, opening the door to land grabs through carbon markets. Notably, there is no clear definition of carbon rights and it is unclear, due to the fact that their contracts with jurisdictions/governments are not publicly available, how GREEN+ views the issue of carbon rights in relation to property rights. Source: AirCarbon. Note: Prices on October 7, 2022. EcoRegistry and Cercarbono are also both partnered with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), “the world's first fully digital carbon exchange,” established in 2019 with the Singapore Sustainable Energy Association – subsidized by the Singapore government's Enterprise Singapore – and backed by the UN. ACX was founded by CEO Thomas McMahon, an over 30 year veteran of the commodities and derivatives industry, having spent over 20 years at the New York Mercantile Exchange before establishing himself in Singapore, where ACX is based. ACX is Singapore's first international carbon credit exchange, chosen by McMahon “due to demand for carbon credits from the airline industry.” The exchange uses distributed ledger technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain, to trade six different tokenized carbon credits, boasting settlement for “as low as $3 per 1,000 CO2 tonnes.” While ACX began mainly by focusing on the airline industry, the exchange now has over 160 clients ranging from financial institutions to project developers. Between January and August 2021, over 5.7 million CO2 tonnes were traded on the exchange. Mubadala, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, acquired a 20% stake in the company, with the intent to build a carbon exchange in the UAE. ACX is also partnered with IETA (more on them below), as well as the Carbon Business Council, and the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). It can be assumed that ACX will be the exchange on which GREEN+ carbon credits will be traded due to its partnerships with GREEN+’s credit certifier and registry. Both Cercarbono and EcoRegistry were also recently integrated into Xpansiv, which “operates the leading multi-registry, multi-asset environmental portfolio management system and market data service” as well as CBL, the “largest spot exchange for environmental commodities, including carbon credits and renewable energy certificates.” Xpansiv is backed by Blackstone, which poured $400 million into the company, with other investors including British Petroleum (BP) Ventures, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. Xpansiv’s CBL has partnered extensively with CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) Group, which is one of the world’s main derivatives exchanges, and together they have produced several futures contracts on carbon markets. Cercarbono and EcoRegistry also both share an affiliation with the International Emissions Trading Association, or IETA. Founded in 1999 under the auspices of the UN, IETA “is dedicated to the establishment of linked trading systems to ensure efficient and competitive GHG [greenhouse gas] markets.” Its inaugural members included the titans of the oil and manufacturing industries. Current members include AngloAmerican mining, Saudi Aramco, Bank of America, Bayer/Monsanto, Cargill, Chevron, Citi Group, Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, PetroChina and the Mossad-linked commodities company Glencore. Another company that is a member of IETA is StoneX, which is partnered with the aforementioned exchange ACX and is sponsoring the launch of GREEN+ satellites in Miami later this month. IETA is also part of the aforementioned Climate Action Data Trust, along with EcoRegistry, the World Bank and others. IETA is also notably behind the ICROA accreditation program, which Cercarbono and most other carbon credit certification standards of note have received. These include the world’s leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was recently embroiled in a major scandal when it was revealed that 90% of their most common category of carbon credits were “worthless” despite being ICROA (and IETA) approved. Satellogic Satellogic - Observation Is Preservation As the digital carbon credit industry grows into a multi-trillion dollar market upheld by smart contracts on a distributed ledger, so too does the need for participants to access metric-specific data to insure the eventual pay outs of green bonds. For example, the company Atos, best known for its Olympic Games IT partnership since 1989, raised $916 million in sustainability-linked bonds at the end of 2021. According to a press release in November 2021, the bonds were issued with “an eight-year maturity and one percent coupon,” with a clause that the annual interest rate paid during the “last three years will be unchanged if the company reduces its annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1, 2 & 3) by 50 percent in 2025 compared to 2019.” While these particular bonds were not authored using a blockchain, there remains the now-sudden economic incentive – a one percent coupon on nearly $1 billion – to deliver verifiable real world data to the participants, the state of which determines the eventual payout. These bonds were issued with BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan acting as Global Coordinators and with Joint Bookrunners such as HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Banco Santander, Bank of America Securities, and Wells Fargo Securities, among others, with Rothschild & Co “acting as financial advisor to Atos SE.” An article from Data Center Dynamics on the raise makes note of the common trend of “sustainability-linked financing” among data center and communication firms, referencing how NTT, Aligned, Airtrunk, KPN, Baidu, and Nabiax all raised “funds or converted existing debt to include interest rates tied to sustainability and ESG goals” within the last year. Atos and techUK When the eventual payout of billions of dollars in cleverly-authored green bonds comes down to accurate measurements of carbon molecule density over a vast land mass, such as a South American rainforest, the market for reliable data service providers has quite literally left the atmosphere. As the debt instruments of the private sector evolve alongside the proliferation of blockchain technology, the data that makes these smart contracts execute to eventually settle the issued bond no longer goes to a human arbitrator, but rather a consciousness-free protocol that reduces a pair of potential outcomes to a single output. In the case of a sustainability-linked green bond, if the carbon emissions of a business are not empirically reduced beyond a relative metric at a certain time – both data points of which are determined at the issuance of the smart contract and thus willingly agreed-upon by both parties – the coupon on the bond is not paid out. With the carbon credit market presenting itself as one of the preferred debt instruments of the modern era, the aforementioned Satellogic – an intelligence-linked company focused on privatizing the data from satellite surveillance with an advisory board full of key players in the digital debt system – finds itself ready to act as a crucial pillar of the encroaching new financial system. Emiliano Kargieman of Satellogic Satellogic was co-founded in 2010 by Emiliano Kargieman, its current CEO, and Gerardo Richarte, its current CTO, after spending “some time” at the NASA Ames Campus in Mountain View, CA. According to press releases on their website, Satellogic is “the first vertically integrated geospatial company” that is building “the first scalable, fully automated EO [Earth Observation] platform” with capabilities to “remap the entire planet at both high-frequency and high-resolution” in order to generate “accessible and affordable solutions for customers.” Their listed mission is “to democratize access to geospatial data through its information platform of high-resolution images and analytics” to help solve the world’s most pressing problems” of which they list “climate change, energy supply, and food security.” Other Satellogic documentation reveals that by “democratize,\" they mean expand satellite surveillance from the public sector (i.e. governments and security agencies) into the private sector. Due to their “patented Earth imaging technology,” Satellogic “unlocks the power of EO” to deliver “high-quality, planetary insights” at “the lowest cost in the industry.” Both Kargieman and Richarte previously worked for Core Security Technologies, which Kargieman co-founded, with clients such as Apple, Cisco, Homeland Security, NSA, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and DARPA. In 1998, Core Security was recognized as an \"Endeavor Entrepreneur\" by the Endeavor Foundation and in 2002, Morgan Stanley invested $1.5 million into Core Security, with the bank gaining a seat on the board. The company was also funded by Bank of America in its Series A. Kargieman later founded Aconcagua Ventures in a joint venture with Craig Cogut’s Pegasus Capital, and served as a Member of the Special Projects Group at the World Bank. As previously noted, Cogut’s Pegasus Capital is also a main funder of CC35. Another Core Security Technologies employee that migrated to Satellogic with Kargeiman and Richarte is Aviv Cohen, a former Israeli intelligence officer who is now Satellogic’s head of “special projects.” Satellogic's seed round raise was funded by Ariel Arrieta and NXTP Ventures, Starlight Ventures – which Kargieman advises – and Santiago Pinto Escalier of Endeavor. As stated earlier in this article, NXTP is a funder of GREEN+ member Rootstock as well as the tokenization firm created by Rootstock’s co-founder, Koibanx. Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns a significant stake in Elon Musk’s Tesla, invested in Satellogic’s Series A as did Endeavor Catalyst, which is run by LinkedIn/PayPal’s Reid Hoffman, and Valor Capital. Valor Capital, whose partners include figures tied to US military and intelligence activities in Latin America as well as CBDC development on the continent, invested in Satellogic’s Series B, again joined by Tencent, with the Inter-American Development Bank (mentioned more than once in this article) joining in the company’s Series C funding round. In July 2021, Satellogic went public with a $1.1 billion valuation through a “merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s CF Acquisition Corp. V,” with J.P. Morgan serving as the “exclusive financial advisor to Satellogic,” with a “concurrent PIPE offering of $100 million led by SoftBank’s SBLA Advisers Corp” alongside Cantor Fitzgerald and “other top-tier institutional investors,” including former US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin's Liberty Strategic Capital. Mnuchin’s recently created venture capital firm, along with Softbank, are major investors in Cybereason, a controversial company tied to Israeli intelligence that previously simulated the hacking of US critical infrastructure in order to cancel a US presidential election and spur the declaration of martial law. Mnuchin’s firm also includes Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and previously attempted to recruit former Mossad director Yossi Cohen, who instead went on to join Softbank. Joseph Dunford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump who is now senior managing director of Mnuchin’s firm, is on the advisory board of Cybereason while Mnuchin is on its board of directors. Both Mnuchin and Dunford simultaneously sit on the board of Satellogic and Mnuchin is Satellogic’s chairman. Satellogic Board of Directors Satellogic’s board also includes Howard Lutnick, longtime head of Cantor Fitzgerald (as well as Jeffrey Epstein’s neighbor and a major Clinton donor); Marcos Galperin, the founder and CEO of MercadoLibre who is closely associated with Endeavor, a Satellogic funder; Former Facebook and Twitter lawyer turned venture capitalist Ted Wang; Tom Killalea, former Chief Information Security Officer and Vice President of Security for Amazon who is also on the board of Capital One; and Miguel Gutiérrez, a Partner and a Co‐Chief Investment Officer at The Rohatyn Group. Gutiérrez previously worked with Nicholas Rohatyn at J.P. Morgan, where Rohatyn positioned the bank to become a leader in taking ownership of distressed government debt in the 1980s and 1990s, with a focus on Latin America. Gutiérrez was involved with J.P. Morgan’s debt markets in Argentina, before becoming its head of Latin America Emerging Markets and later head of Global Emerging Market Sales. The press release about Satellogic’s SPAC paints a clear picture of the hefty value proposition behind the public offering, which boasts that Satellogic is the “proven leader in Earth Observation” with “17 commercial satellites” currently in orbit, more than “the next four Earth Observation companies combined.” The satellite company's vertical product stack offers “enhanced analytics capabilities” with “commercial, sustainability, and government applications” by providing a “live catalog” daily of “every square meter of Earth,” providing “vital information to power the conversation around global challenges” such as “climate change, water and energy use, and food supply.” In the SPAC press release, Cantor’s Howard Lutnick stated that “Satellogic is uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry. Its technology, data, and analytics have vast use cases across countless industries.” Kargieman echoed these remarks: “We think this is a winner takes most or winner takes all market. This is a supply limited market – governments just can’t get enough data today; there’s not enough satellites out there.” This is also true for the private sector. Satellogic showed CNBC a then-current investor deck which exemplified the true economic potential of dominating “the Earth Observation industry.” Kargieman noted that the company had completed “a pilot program” with “a major oil and gas corporation,” in which the company required surveillance data for “about 1,800 miles of pipeline every other week.” Doing this visual audit with airplanes “cost about $750 per mile,” whereas Satellogic “demonstrated similar detection capabilities” for less than $60 per mile. While Satellogic failed to clear $0 of revenue in 2020, the company was expecting to see that “tick up” due to new contracts that began generating revenue in the spring of 2021. According to an investor slide deck, the company had a backlog of about $38 million in signed contracts around when they went public, but was predicting “$800 million in opportunities over the next two years.” In their full year 2022 financial results update, Satellogic CEO Kargieman tallied “34 satellites in orbit” making “the largest commercial fleet of sub-meter resolution satellites” and thus “well positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for Earth Observation data and satellites.” Kargieman claimed their revenue grew “42% year-over-year” due in large part to their “Asset Monitoring” and “Constellation-as-a-Service” businesses. Satellogic's new Space Systems, or satellite sales business, “creates a satellite purchase program that aims to lower the financial barrier to Earth Observation spacecraft ownership” according to CFO Rick Dunn. “Space Systems is designed to offer governments asset ownership to enhance national geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) with global tasking autonomy... Going forward, revenue will be driven by our continued growth in Asset Monitoring.” Luciano Giesso, Sales Director for Satellogic has stated that Latin America is “an area of focus for us.” He explained a current trend of Latin America being “increasingly focused on space technologies” in order to “create new infrastructures” that “unlock the benefits of satellite data” throughout multiple industries. The press release states Satellogic's position is informed by their view that “countries unequipped with their own satellites” are thus “limited in their ability” to meaningfully “capture data about their policy implementation and infrastructure.” Satellogic’s Dedicated Satellite Constellation Program is specifically marketed as a product for “strategic national interests” allowing “governments of all sizes” to create “unique earth-observation programs” to “support key decisions and manage policy impact, measure investment and socio-economic progress, and foster collaboration, data and information sharing, and innovation.” The stated mission of Satellogic is to privatize and monopolize Earth Observation in the form of satellite surveillance sold as a service to both the public and private sectors. Palantir, a private sector intelligence firm led by PayPal founder Peter Thiel and created with CIA funds to replace a controversial DARPA mass surveillance and data-mining program, committed to a five year strategic partnership wth Satellogic. Satellogic's partnership with Palantir enables its “government and commercial customers”, which include the CIA and J.P. Morgan, access to Satellogic’s Aleph platform APIs to feed raw satellite imagery to Palantir’s MetaConstellation and Edge AI. This partnership builds on a previous collaboration between Satellogic and Palantir to “field unique AI capabilities to the orbital edge,” including “live upgrades to the satellite’s onboard AI” that enables “an ultra-low-latency maritime use-case.” Palantir and Satellogic customers, which include the Pentagon's Space Systems Command, Space Force, SpaceX, the government of India, and others, will soon have access to the Edge AI platform running on Satellogic satellites “to offer customers tailored AI insights” which is expected to increase Satellogic’s business of “data products, streamline pipeline management, and further scale customer delivery required for weekly and daily world remaps.” Palantir “The holistic capabilities of Palantir’s Foundry will be instrumental in helping Satellogic realize our mission to improve life on Earth through geospatial data,” commented Matthew Tirman, President of Satellogic North America. Tirman later made note that within this agreement, Satellogic will provide “Palantir’s US government customers” with access to “high-resolution satellite imagery” which will “drive analytical insights across a range of mission-oriented use cases.” Other notable private-public sector partnerships of Satellogic include the Endeavor-funded SkyLoom, which in late 2021 partnered with Honeywell to “produce laser crosslinks” for both commercial and military satellites, including for the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency, as well as with CIA contractor Amazon Web Services, to facilitate the “50 gigabytes of data per day” per satellite, which “beams to Earth with the help of the Amazon.com Inc. unit’s AWS Ground Station service.” While it is surely a profitable venture, what Satellogic truly enables is venture capital access to high resolution data of every single square meter on Earth. Space surveillance as a service allows the operators themselves to fill up on up-to-date information of the world's industry, energy use, transportation, commodity storage, and asset consumption – information that could influence a firm's decision while playing in the private markets. It could also be used by the public-private partnership engineering global technocratic policies that seek to limit consumption, industrialization and energy use by the public and enforce them via space. Outside of this metric-driven advantage, the aforementioned transition to a universal ledger upholding and settling the majority of financial (including purely speculative) activity will require obscene amounts of data. If the private sector's so-called commodity-backed, Real World Asset tokens are to take off in any meaningful way, highly reliable satellite imagery will be needed to uphold billions of dollars of value. Any push towards smart contract-derived money representing tangible objects will demand exactly the data Satellogic intends to not only supply but sell as a service – to any firm, or government. Blockchain - The New Enabling Environment The idea of green finance, in which private firms utilize data and physical elements from the real world to create novel economic instruments such as bonds based on carbon emissions, necessitates government-upheld agreements and eventual court-based litigation as the ability to find consensus, thus acting as the enabling environment, for the settlement of large values of securities between the public and private sector. Regulation and contractual agreements between governments and their commercial sector partners require not just the literal letter of the law, but vetted insurance brokers, data firms, legislative bureaucrats, and various other accredited lawyers to dictate the grounds in which business can be legally conducted. The private-public partnership has become continually blurred by the relaxing of regulation restricting how corporations can influence current and aspiring politicians via campaign fundraising. In turn, this group of purchased public sector employees must repay the corporations responsible for their successful attempts at gaining office, leading to the push for further dissolution of certain laws that prevented their donors from gaining footholds within a once-regulated market. No longer is the public sector primarily beholden to their constituents, but rather their corporate donors. This ongoing dynamic has led to a runaway feedback of legal corruption and conspiracy between these ostensibly delineated sectors. The net result of the public-private partnerships that upholds the CC35, Green+ and Satellogic collaborations is due to the calculated focus on regional governments, thus finding their enabling environment through pacts and treaties at the subnational level. Steve Mnuchin Once larger regulatory “fish are fried,” the fight for further interoperability of digital assets (such as dollar instruments) moves down to the regional governments of the Global South. For example, the regulation allowing US banks to custody digital assets and stablecoins was put forth by former OneWest official and Coinbase VP Brian Brooks while he served as comptroller of the currency under Mnuchin in the Trump administration. Once world governments, local and national, are forced onboard the universal ledger, the enabling environment will trend towards the ledger itself – a product of the private sector – and further out of the hands of the public sector. This capturing of the commons by the private sector via a revolving door of public-then-private operators has been done before, such as during the Plaza Accord, the creation of Brady Bonds, the dissolution of Glass-Steagall, the demolition of Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 fiscal response. The intended future of blockchain – now that US regulators have embraced Bitcoin as an asset and universal ledger – is to serve as the new enabling environment, complete with its very own digital dollar instruments, most likely backed by US government debt. There are very few people in the world more responsible for the digitization of the dollar than Steve Mnuchin and Howie Lutnick – the former's VC firm now consists of several members from his stint at the Treasury, while the latter's firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds the securities for Tether, the world's largest dollar-denominated stablecoin that recently crossed $100 billion issued – and here they are partnering with the richest man in Argentina and the founder of the largest online marketplace (as well as crypto marketplace) in Latin America, Marcos Galperin. The network of firms associated with Galperin's MercadoLibre – Xapo, Paxos, Circle, Visa, among others – is rife with board members and venture capital from the “PayPal Mafia,” as well as the Argentine advisor group Endeavor. These powerful organizations, successors to groups like ADELA that spurred the creation of the Club of Rome and chose the winners of Latin America’s corporate landscape, have made it clear that they foresee this fundamental market transition. They have quietly positioned themselves to dominate the main pillars of the new financial system in Latin America and the world at large: regulated banking services, global marketplaces, payment processing, digital asset infrastructure, and capital creation monopolies. As we will see, this financial system is not about “inclusion” or “sustainability” as professed, but about using and deepening Latin America’s debt burden to force policy changes while enforcing foreign control over the region’s economic activity and governance, all under the watchful “eyes” of US intelligence-linked satellites.

The move reflects growing institutional interest despite China's previous hostility towards Bitcoin. Harvest Fund manages over $230 billion in total assets, while Southern Fund oversees over $280 billion. Approval of Bitcoin ETF products from such influential institutions could significantly validate Bitcoin in the eyes of both Chinese regulators and investors. The news is also a testament to the evolving landscape of Bitcoin in China. Despite its previous crackdown on Bitcoin trading and mining, the country is now witnessing a shift. While the mainland remains cautious, Hong Kong has adopted a more open approach, attracting the attention of Chinese funds. By leveraging Hong Kong subsidiaries, major funds can gain exposure to Bitcoin in a compliant manner. The location provides a legal loophole for Chinese companies to participate in the burgeoning Bitcoin asset class. Industry insiders are buzzing with anticipation as they predict a significant milestone in Bitcoin. Hong Kong's first Bitcoin ETFs could potentially launch as early as Q2 this year.

The move comes ahead of industry expectations for launches later this year. Multiple Chinese financial institutions, including the Hong Kong subsidiaries of Harvest Fund and China Southern Fund, have applied for bitcoin ETFs recently. Spot bitcoin ETFs provide exposure to actual bitcoin rather than derivatives. According to sources, the SFC will announce its first approved batch of spot bitcoin ETFs on April 15. After approvals, the funds can then be applied to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which is expected to take 10 days. This accelerated timeline demonstrates Hong Kong's proactive approach in enhancing its appeal as a global financial hub. It also builds on the city's Bitcoin-friendly stance, including granting crypto exchange Hashkey a retail trading license last year. The news comes after the tremendous success of spot bitcoin ETFs in the United States after approval this January, which attracted over $12 billion in inflows. As the first Asian jurisdiction to approve spot bitcoin ETFs, Hong Kong is paving the way for potential launches in other markets. Accessible Bitcoin investment products have seen rapid growth in demand among both institutional and retail investors.

CarbonChain’s recent report on Gryphon shows that the company has used 100% renewable energy to mine bitcoin thus far in 2024 and 98% renewable energy in 2023, as per Scope 1 and 2 of the report. “We’re 100% renewable, and we’re showing you exactly how it’s calculated,” Gryphon Digital Mining CEO Rob Chang told Bitcoin Magazine. “And we’re not even the ones calculating it. It’s a respected third party doing it,” he added. “There are various levels of transparency that the industry needs, but the fact that the reporting is not uniform can be fixed and should be fixed — and we’re happy to lead the way.” Gryphon currently conducts all of its mining through a hosting contract with Coinmint at a facility located in upstate New York that harnesses 100% hydroelectric power for its operations. While bitcoin mining operations have caused electricity prices to spike in some upstate New York towns, Gryphon’s operation is having the opposite effect. “Our location is in an economic Opportunity Zone, so, if anything, there isn’t much demand [for power] competing against us,” Chang told Bitcoin Magazine. “In fact, the existence of bitcoin mining is providing economic power deployment for the region, because it is actually a stable consumer of power that allows the economic delivery of more power to the area,” he added. Gryphon is looking to expand its operations into other jurisdictions that have supportive regulations around bitcoin mining and that offer favorable economics for mining as well as renewable energy to power its facilities. “If it’s economic and carbon neutral, we’re there,” said Chang.

Talks have stalled for nearly two years over the IMF's calls to limit Bitcoin's scope in the country. According to the IMF's communications director Julie Kozack on last Thursday, the \"risks\" of Bitcoin remain a key issue in discussions with El Salvador. The IMF has previously cited financial integrity and stability concerns about Bitcoin. The fund's opposition highlights a clash over the future of money and payments. While Bukele sees Bitcoin as an innovative solution for financial inclusion, the IMF remains wary of its volatility and decentralized nature, and a threat to their dominance. Irrespective of pressures, El Salvador has stood firm on its Bitcoin commitment. The country has invested over $150 million in BTC reserves, continually buying more. Bukele also pledged to purchase 1 BTC daily. The IMF loan impasse puts El Salvador in a difficult fiscal position. By tying loan access to changes in El Salvador's Bitcoin law, the IMF is exerting its influence over poorer nations. But Bukele seems unwilling to back down on Bitcoin, creating an ideological tug-of-war. El Salvador's pioneering Bitcoin adoption signaled a shift toward decentralization and self-determination. Demands to roll back the Bitcoin law undermine the country's monetary sovereignty. The standoff illustrates the disruptive potential of Bitcoin to reshape global finance. While risky for El Salvador in the near-term, Bukele's Bitcoin bet could pay long-run dividends.","category":["El Salvador"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1a5","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/fully-noded-the-basics-and-benefits-of-running-a-bitcoin-node","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Fully Noded: The Basics and Benefits of Running a Bitcoin Node","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","creation_date":"2024-04-08T21:30:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NTk0ODk4ODIzMzkwMjgy/ledger-10-steps--fully-noded---article-preview.png","article_summary":"While you can interact with the Bitcoin network solely using a wallet, running your own node delivers privacy benefits and grants the ability to verify your transactions and Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. The fifth installment of “10 Steps to Self-Sovereignty” powered by Ledger.","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin is a decentralized and finite digital currency, it’s verifiable by anyone anywhere in the world. This is the chief reason people have any interest in holding it at all. No one can dilute the supply, no one can counterfeit Bitcoin, it just works as an autonomous system that cannot be interfered with. So how do you participate in this system fully to verify everything? If you think that simply using a Bitcoin wallet is enough to do so, I’m sorry to tell you that in reality that does not make you a full participant in the Bitcoin network. A wallet simply manages your private keys and helps you craft and sign your transactions, it does not actually participate in the full validation of the Bitcoin blockchain. To become a node and validate the transactions you need to run an additional piece of software called a client. This software is what actually handles processing and validating blocks that miners produce. The most widely used Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core. It is possible to interact with Bitcoin using just a wallet, and not running a full node, but there are benefits to actually using Bitcoin Core yourself. Verifying Things Yourself When you initiate and then sign a transaction to send an amount of Bitcoin, the signed transaction goes to the Bitcoin network’s nodes. These full nodes, some of which are miners, verify transactions and then form a race to make the next block. Miners bundle transactions together into a block, and upon completing the required proof-of-work, the block is broadcast to the network Most people likely don’t care about other people’s bitcoin payments, if you aren’t the sender or the receiver in a transaction why would you care? If any transaction in a Bitcoin block is not a valid transaction, then the entire block is considered invalid and rejected by all full nodes running on the network. This means that in order to be absolutely sure that a payment your wallet is showing as confirmed is in fact confirmed, you need to know that every other transaction confirmed in that block is also valid. Your full node handles all of this for you automatically. Every time a block is found, your node automatically verifies that every coin being spent has not been spent before, that all the signatures are valid, and that all other spending conditions such as timelocks meet the spending requirements. When you are using a wallet without verifying it with your own full node, you are essentially trusting the operator of that wallet to do all of this verification for you. Running a full node yourself completely removes this aspect of trust you place in your wallet provider. The Supply Cap The finite supply of 21 million bitcoin is one of, if not the, core properties of Bitcoin that people think of when the subject comes up. At the core of the entire project sits the idea of removing the issuance and control over the supply of money from the hands of governments. Satoshi himself specifically discussed the factor of trust placed in government to not debase the monetary supply as a core problem of how money functioned in society. All of the work that a full node does to verify your own transactions is also the verification necessary to ensure the integrity of the 21 million supply cap. Every bitcoin that exists in circulation on the network right now came from the same source ultimately, a special transaction in each block called the coinbase transaction. This special transaction allows the miners to bring a predefined amount of Bitcoin into circulation per block. Your node validates each of these coinbase transactions every time a block is found. It does this to guarantee that the new coins brought into circulation do not exceed the limitations of the predefined supply cap. Any excess above that must be no more than the transaction fees paid by all of the transactions in that block. The combination of verifying that the coinbase transaction follows these special rules, as well as the fact that every other transaction is only spending valid coins that have never been spent before, your full node guarantees that the supply cap of 21 million coins is kept intact. Keeping Your Bitcoin Private Another important aspect of why it is important to run your own node is privacy. Now, before making this point it is very important to understand that privacy is a very nuanced issue on bitcoin. When it comes to actually maintaining privacy and preventing the people you actually transact with, i.e. send money to or receive money from, running a node is by no means a comprehensive solution. It is a very important starting point: the foundation necessary to improve your privacy. When you are using a Bitcoin wallet that is not connected to your own full node, you must rely on someone else to process your transactions. To do so your wallet communicates all of the details about your bitcoin wallet to someone else’s node. Most of the time, this involves sending them the details of your xpub, the code that allows someone to read your transaction history and see your unspent coins. For most people, this isn't a threat, but if you want to stay anonymous this may pose a risk. By running your own full node and connecting your wallet to that, none of this information is revealed to them. If you value maintaining your privacy in using Bitcoin, connecting your wallet to your own full node is an absolute requirement. Without using your own node, all of the other steps you take to maintain your privacy such as coinjoining (coinjoins are a collaborative transaction you can trustlessly make with other people to obscure whose coins go where) are a moot point, your wallet provider can see your entire balance. Why This is All Important While holding your own keys is an absolute necessity to interact with Bitcoin in a sovereign way, hopefully you can see now that taking the extra steps to fully validate your interactions with your own full node has additional benefits. Without running your own full node, you are trusting a wallet provider to verify that your transactions are being confirmed. It is possible for that operator to deceive you. They can tell you that you have received coins that don’t actually exist. They could attempt to trick you by saying coins you did receive never arrived. You are trusting them to verify your balance for you, or some other third party block explorer which learns your IP address. A full node can remove that trust. Trusting someone else to verify your transactions for you similarly outsources the verification of the total supply of bitcoin to the collective group of users who are actually verifying things themselves. By running your own node you can verify yourself with absolute certainty that the supply cap has remained intact. Lastly, maintaining the privacy of your funds is not something that can be meaningfully achieved without running your own node. If you are using tools like coinjoins to obscure your transaction history on-chain, this activity is undermined by using someone else’s node to verify your balances. Only by running your own node can you plug this massive privacy hole in your use of Bitcoin. Holding your own keys is a critical first step on your path down the road in Bitcoin, but by not taking this next step you are making certain compromises in your interaction with the network. Once you have your keys safely secured, it is absolutely important that you take this next step.

The sixth installment of “10 Steps to Self-Sovereignty” powered by Ledger.","article_detailed_content":"The Bitcoin Halving: Gold is on Borrowed Time For the first time since its inception, Bitcoin’s annual inflation rate is poised to become less than that of gold, the quintessential store of value. At Bitcoin block height 840,000, the annual supply of Bitcoin will be cut in half, resulting in a decrease in its annual inflation rate from 1.7% to 0.85%. In comparison, the supply of gold is estimated to increase by 1-2% per year, depending on technological changes and economic conditions. To date, Bitcoin has experienced three halving events: November 28, 2012: Bitcoin’s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. July 9, 2016: The second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. May 20, 2020: The third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. The upcoming fourth Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 20, 2024 EDT, and with it, the newly supplied bitcoin per block will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This epoch — a period of 210,000 blocks or approximately 4 years – will see Bitcoin’s supply increase by 164,250 BTC (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. ~94% of the total #bitcoin supply has now been issued and the halving is in 11 days 👀 Digital scarcity at its finest 🚀 pic.twitter.com/fjbLs1tq7r — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 8, 2024 Gold Throughout the Ages One benchmark often used to underscore the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold matches the price of a “fine man’s suit” over time. This principle, known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the amount of gold you would pay for a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga. While gold has held remarkably true to the expectation of procuring a fine man’s suit for its holders over the years, the lustrous yellow metal does come with its challenges. For example, the cost of verification – or assaying – gold requires it to either be dissolved in a solution or melted down. This is certainly a challenge for someone who wants to purchase everyday household goods with their hard-fought store of value. Additionally, the cost and onerous nature of transporting and storing gold itself arguably led to the demise of the gold standard. While certificates of deposit were historically redeemable for gold, the underlying commodity was often rehypothecated, resulting in the infamous ”Nixon Shock” in 1971, when the United States left the gold standard for good. This is not to mention the risks that come from securing physical gold, its physical nature again proving a risk and liability in serving its function as currency. Executive Order 6102 comes to mind, when then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt prohibited “the hoarding of gold coin”, highlighting the unique challenge of adequately and privately securing precious metals to store value. Bitcoin’s Transition from Speculation to Safe Haven? Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations in the early days, bitcoin has increasingly been adopted as a store of value. Today, investors recognize its potential worth, and superior qualities as a monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the discovery of digital scarcity while offering a range of use cases far beyond those of precious metals. As such Bitcoin has become a significant force in the economy in just 15 years – reaching a market cap of $1.4 trillion on March 13, 2024. Source: Glassnode While this growth cannot be monocausally ascribed to the fact that Bitcoin satisfies the requirements of a store of value better than gold, it is certainly promising. This “magic internet money” continues to rapidly gain on gold’s estimated $15.9 trillion market capitalization. Gold’s Monetary Qualities: Perfected Digitally Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies, and the market-driven supply of precious metals. Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring it remains a reliable store of value over time barring unforeseen catastrophic tail risks. Given its informational nature, the ability to store Bitcoin despite the attempts of adversaries to prevent you from doing so is another positive monetary attribute. Immutability: Once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, it is incredibly difficult, though not impossible, to alter or reverse. This immutability, derived from the geographical distribution of Bitcoin’s network of nodes and miners, is a critical feature. It ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise as a monetary good – predictable, free of terminal inflation, and easily transferable – has contributed to it gaining acceptance as a store of value among holders. With the upcoming halving, its scarcity will surpass gold’s for the first time and will likely serve as a wake-up call for market participants seeking to avoid the drag of monetary debasement. While there are no certainties in life, and especially none in investing, the near-certainty that Bitcoin provides in its ability to maintain the integrity of its 21 million supply cap through its decentralized nature continues to drive adoption one block at a time. Gold had a good run. But, with the halving on the horizon, it’s Bitcoin’s time to shine.","category":["Finite Supply","Bitcoin","Gold","Sponsored"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e199","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-payment-processor-btcpay-server-to-debut-origin-story-documentary-in-poland","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-payment-processor-btcpay-server-to-debut-origin-story-documentary-in-poland","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Bitcoin Payment Processor BTCPay Server To Debut Origin Story Documentary In Poland","author":"Nik Hoffman","creation_date":"2024-04-11T00:11:19Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1NjQzNDM1MTc1MDYxMDIx/btcpay-documentary-cover.png","article_summary":"The film will premiere at the Bitcoin Film Festival on April 19.","article_detailed_content":"BTCPay Server, an open-source bitcoin payment processor, is set to premiere a feature documentary titled \"My Trust In You Is Broken\" at the Bitcoin Film Fest in Warsaw, Poland, on April 19.

The Bitcoin ecosystem has always had a dogmatic streak; it’s kind of an inherent part of it. It takes a certain degree of stubbornness or dogma to get involved in something like Bitcoin this early on and demonstrate the type of conviction necessary to hodl on for the ride. Bitcoin is almost 15 years old, and a lot of the newer people who just entered the space in the last few years don’t really understand how wildly different the entire landscape was even just five years ago. You used to be able to feed a 50-dollar bill into a Bitcoin ATM and get 0.25 BTC for it with nothing but a phone number, and no filters or restrictions on burner numbers with no KYC attached. There were no nation-states adopting bitcoin as legal tender. The only ETF attempts were 100% guaranteed to be denied without a chance at serious consideration or approval. Lightning was still just a vague concept with nothing deployed in the real world. You had to be at least a little bit dogmatic to even consider for a moment putting any sizable amount of your net worth into bitcoin; there was no real indication of its success at all except belief in its design. If you didn’t have that, you likely didn’t stick around to the present day. At the very least you walked in and out the door frequently enough to wind up with much less than you could have had if you just stayed put. That dogma was necessary — without it the people who have built this ecosystem into what it is today wouldn’t have had the motivation to do so. Without that dogma, those people would not have had customers and users to build anything for in the first place. It was the foundation of everything we have around us today. Now the inevitable is happening: the foundation is cracking. Click the image above to subscribe! Which Church Do You Go To? The thing with dogma is that the vast majority of the time it starts to fracture; the growth of discontent and dissent within the existing dogma, it doesn’t die — it multiplies. And that outgrowth externally tends to reinforce the existing dogma within those who remain. When people in Europe started to ideologically diverge from the Catholic Church, they didn’t destroy it — they fractured off and created their own church with their own conflicting dogma. There was no death and decay of the Catholic Church as it faded off into irrelevance; instead the Protestant Reformation led to a proliferation of numerous conflicting ideologies with their own dogma existing alongside the Catholic Church. The Protestant Reformation in the 1500s is always portrayed as being the first major dissent from the Catholic Church, painting life prior to Martin Luther as a peaceful environment of subservience to the Church. But this is not the historical reality. The Great Schism that led to the split between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church occurred approximately 500 years before Martin Luther’s famous Theses. What was the first domino to fall in the chain reaction that led to the schism? Churches in southern Italy that conducted mass in Greek were informed by the Pope that they must start conducting their masses in Latin. From here disagreements multiplied. Was it acceptable to use unleavened bread in the sacrament of communion? The West thought it was; the East disagreed. Should priests have to remain celibate? The West thought they should, and again the East disagreed. This ultimately culminated in a papal envoy being sent to Constantinople, where the head clergymen of the East, the Ecumenical Patriarch, had been directly voicing these disagreements to the Pope. During the meetings in Constantinople disagreements boiled up to the point of the head of the envoy excommunicating the Patriarch, and the Patriarch excommunicating the members of the envoy. This fracture never healed, and led to the permanent schism between the Catholic Church and what became the Eastern Orthodox Church. That schism is not unlike the divide between small blockers and large blockers that culminated in a split of sorts in the 2017 end of the Blocksize Wars. Both Catholics and the divergent Eastern believers worshiped God. They both agreed on the holy divinity of Jesus Christ. There was no disagreement or rifts on core fundamental truths such as that, just like ultimately small blockers and big blockers alike both wanted Bitcoin to succeed and grow to become a dominant economic force in the world. They simply disagreed about how to go about accomplishing that. They had the exact same goal, but differences in thoughts on how to achieve it led to an irreconcilable division that has lasted six years (or over a thousand years in the case of the churches). At least they took over the dominant dogma, right? Wrong. The estimated population of Catholics is 1 billion people today, versus some 200 million people belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church. In both cases, despite creating a new dogma that gathered a significant number of devout believers, neither the Orthodox Church nor the big blockers actually destroyed or subsumed the previously existing dogma. Breaking News at 10: When you tell someone everything they believe about the universe around them is wrong they dig deeper into their preexisting beliefs. The Protestants’ Disgust With Indulgences So now that we have established that the Protestants were not the first to diverge from the Catholic Church, let’s look at what actually happened to elicit such a harsh reaction from Udi, I mean Martin Luther: indulgences — the idea that you could just pay your way into having your sins forgiven. A common ascribed phrase to advertise indulgences often cited as one of the things that finally pushed Luther over the edge was, “As soon as the coin into the box rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven springs”. That is how boldly Catholic priests would push the idea that by giving the Church money you would automatically be absolved of your sins. “Just follow these simple easy steps to find your guaranteed economic salvation.” Sound familiar? Just dollar-cost average, just read this book, just follow these simple steps and you are guaranteed to find your salvation. Just getting your hands on 0.1 BTC ensures you a seat at the table as a member of the economic elite of the new world order. Promises like this are completely delusional, and the parallels between that type of evangelization and the Catholic practice of indulgences are so stark they’re undeniable. In the framework of this analogy I would say the JPEG People represent the Protestants. They are a group of Bitcoiners who are fed up with the notion that “this one simple trick” is enough to guarantee an individual’s financial success in using Bitcoin. They are especially fed up with so much energy in this space being devoted to catering to that attitude and narrative. I honestly can’t blame them, and I agree with some of the things that they criticize and are upset with. It has not only become a dominant attitude in this space that no one needs to really do anything in order for Bitcoin to succeed, but many people with that attitude actively attack, FUD, and disrupt efforts or ideas to address shortcomings of Bitcoin that could lead to its failure. I have spoken up about this dynamic and the problems it is exacerbating many times over the years. It’s not surprising to me in the slightest to see a new subculture and dogma rise in this space defining itself through opposition to this blind attitude of preordained success. Here’s a cold, hard reality check: Like I said earlier, the Protestant Reformation didn’t eclipse and wipe out the Catholic Church. Even at an estimated population of 800 million to 1 billion people — roughly the same size as the Catholic population — Protestants have not marginalized the Catholic Church. The Pope is still one of the most listened to and respected religious figures around the world. Catholicism is still adhered to worldwide. And the funniest part? Shortly after Martin Luther’s death, the Church banned the exchange of money for the forgiving of one’s sins. What does this teach us? Despite the primary reason for Protestants leaving and forming their own dogma actually being addressed and forbidden by the Church, they didn’t come back. Why is that? And another factor I just mentioned above is that the Protestant population is almost 1 billion people; they are not all a single congregation or dogma. The Protestants continued fracturing and dividing, forming a large set of conflicting and contradictory dogmas over the years. They did not remain or grow into a single competitive group competing with Catholicism. Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. Dissent Breeds Dissent Does it make more sense now why Catholicism was never actually usurped or subsumed by new dogmas? Nothing ever grew to the size that it actually could, the preexisting dogma didn’t just sit around content and unchanging; it evolved around dissent strong enough to actually incite material amounts of people to challenge and leave it. If some aspect of current dogma was so disliked and disagreed with that people became dissuaded from its accuracy, eventually the current dogma changed to acknowledge that. From a cold and logical point of view, it’s simply a matter of survival. And what of the new dogmas that were birthed before that period of adaptation and evolution? They continued on and did not simply fold back into their original belief after it conceded to their disagreement. But that dissent, that acceptance of it, the fact that to a degree the new dogma was actually defined by it, festered. This encouraged people who adapted the new dogma to dissent even from that, and this cycle repeated itself. This is why there is no single “Protestant” dogma. You have the Lutherans and the Calvanites, the Anglicans, the Baptists, the Quakers, the Methodists, etc. The list goes on and on. We have seen the same thing with big blockers. First, the Bitcoin Cash people split from Bitcoin. Then, Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Both of them had numerous splits from that point among themselves. Why should anyone expect the JPEG People to be any different? They, too, predominantly define themselves as “against” the Laser Eyes. They cheer themselves on as “doing what the Laser Eyes couldn’t” as they pat themselves on the back for spurring adoption. They, too, seem to base a large portion of their comradery around “owning the Laser Eyes”. Their entire dogma is almost entirely defined by its existence as an opposite to the dogma of the Laser Eyes. That is why in all likelihood there will be no long-lasting cultural effect to come of this new dogma as it exists today. There is nothing it can define itself by in a vacuum. Every Christian ostensibly stands on their faith in Jesus Christ, but many denominations define that faith by standing in contrast to the Catholic Church. What is that in terms of the foundation for a belief? What does that really define a person as in terms of goals, motivations, or net productive output? The JPEG People claim they are here to “make Bitcoin fun again”, to get people engaged and interested in using it, and there is undeniably a good number of people in that community who actually live by that. But there is in my experience a much larger number of people who define themselves through their actions as simply existing to “own the Laser Eyes”. That doesn’t produce anything of value. That doesn’t actually inspire people with a vision. Movements, dogmas, cultures, any of these things that are defined solely by their opposition to other movements or dogmas or cultures lose their identity the moment the thing they exist in opposition to is defeated. To really create a lasting and transformative cultural shift, there needs to be a foundation of identity that can exist on its own.

The halving (also known as the “Halvening”) is one of the most important and innovative features of Bitcoin. Every 10 minutes, the Bitcoin network issues new bitcoin and approximately every four years (every 210,000 blocks, to be precise) the amount issued (the “block subsidy”) is cut in half. The block subsidy is the reward miners receive for validating and recording new transactions on the blockchain. The halving of the block subsidy is a critical factor in bitcoin’s eventual capped supply of 21 million bitcoin. In addition, miners also collect transaction fees that users attach to their transactions to encourage miners to include them in the next block. Therefore miners often earn more bitcoin for mining a block than just the subsidy. . WHEN IS THE NEXT BITCOIN HALVING? The next Bitcoin halving is anticipated to take place on April 20, 2024 EST, reducing the block reward from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. This halving period — or epoch — will increase the supply by 164,250 bitcoin (from 19,687,500 to 20,671,875), a mere 328,124 bitcoin from the maximum supply limit of 21 million. TO CALCULATE THE NEXT HALVING DATE Determine the block interval: While it’s true that Bitcoin’s block time (the time between each block) is approximately 10 minutes, the time can vary slightly due to hash rate and network adjustments. Find the current block height: You need to know the current block height, which you can find on various blockchain explorer websites or directly from your Bitcoin node if you’re running one. Calculate the blocks remaining until the next halving: Bitcoin’s halving occurs every 210,000 blocks. Subtract the current block height from the next halving block height. Calculate the estimated time remaining: Multiply the number of blocks remaining by the approximate block interval (in seconds) to estimate the time remaining until the next halving. Convert the time into a date: Convert the estimated time remaining into a date format to find out when the next halving is expected. Current block height: can be found here. Block time: can be found here. Current date: xx/xx/xxxx Blocks per epoch: 210,000 Next halving block height: 210,000 times next halving number Calculation: (((Next Halving Block Height - Current Block Height)*10)/60)/24 = Days remaining Hash rate and difficulty adjustment are two variables which constantly shape the speed at which blocks are processed and therefore the intervals between blocks. The date of the next halving can vary as a result, so it’s important to keep running the calculation. HISTORY OF BITCOIN HALVINGS As of March 2024, there have been three Bitcoin halvings: On November 28, 2012, Bitcoin’s block subsidy decreased from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block. On July 9, 2016, the second Bitcoin halving decreased the block subsidy from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block. On May 20, 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block subsidy from 12.5 BTC per block to 6.25 BTC per block. BITCOIN HALVING 2012 The 2012 halving was Bitcoin’s first halving. Halving: Date: November 28, 2012 Halving number: 01 Block height: 210,000 Block reward: 25 Mined supply: 10,500,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 5,250,000 Percentage of mined supply: 25% BITCOIN HALVING 2016 The 2016 halving was Bitcoin’s second halving. Halving: Date: July 9, 2016 Halving number: 01 Block height: 420,000 Block reward: 12.5 Mined supply: 15,750,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 2,625,000 Percentage of mined supply: 12.5% BITCOIN HALVING 2020 The 2020 halving was Bitcoin’s third halving. Halving: Date: May 20, 2020 Halving number: 03 Block height: 630,000 Block reward: 6.25 Mined supply: 18,375,000 (amount of bitcoin already issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 1,312,500 Percentage of mined supply: 6.25% BITCOIN HALVING 2024 The 2024 halving will be Bitcoin’s third halving. Halving: Date: April 19, 2024 (estimated) Halving number: 04 Block height: 840,000 Block reward: 3.125 Mined supply: 19,687,500 (amount of bitcoin issued when the halving occurred) Epoch: Subsidy: 656,250 Percentage of mined supply: 3.125% FUTURE BITCOIN HALVINGS The blocktime variable will introduce some variance in estimated halving dates, but it is possible to project approximate dates until the conclusion of block subsidies in 2140. Below, we provide a succinct overview of anticipated halving dates from 2024 to 2060, offering valuable insights into these upcoming milestones.

Price Appreciation Historically, bitcoin’s price has experienced significant upswings following halving events due to the combination of reduced supply and increased demand. These events substantially influence the overall supply of bitcoin, thereby affecting its price. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the price dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond halving events. After the 2012 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 9,000% to $1,162. After the 2016 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 4,200% to $19,800. After the 2020 halving, the bitcoin price rose approximately 683% to $69,000. Bitcoin issuance rate gets reduced in half roughly every four years. Challenges for Miners Halving events can pose challenges for miners, as their income decreases when block rewards are cut in half. To remain competitive, miners must operate efficiently, potentially driving the development and adoption of more energy-efficient mining technology. It is quite common for miners to go bankrupt, which often impacts the network’s hash rate, the supply of available for-sale bitcoin, and ultimately bitcoin’s price. Through the upheaval, the difficulty adjustment eventually restores equilibrium and the Bitcoin network and ecosystem continues to march forward. FAQs: Will Bitcoin go up at the halving? Bitcoin’s historical performance after a halving event has shown a remarkable upward trajectory. The reduction in the rate of new supply is Bitcoin’s path to absolute scarcity. This event often sparks increased interest and demand. However, it’s vital to exercise caution and not view the halvings as guaranteed paths to quick profits. The prudent approach is to understand the long-term potential of bitcoin and consider it as a store of value rather than attempting to time the market with buying and selling. Is Bitcoin halving bullish? The Bitcoin halving is unquestionably a bullish event, as it shifts the supply dynamics in favor of price appreciation. While the halving is generally seen as a bullish event, it’s wise to remember that bitcoin’s price is influenced by several factors. Caution is advised. How many days after Bitcoin halving does it hit its peak? A look at the past three halving events shows that a significant price rise usually begins within a few months of the halving event. Also, before a halving event, the price of bitcoin tends to rise as investors anticipate a price rally post-halving. After the halving, the price usually takes over 12 months to reach its peak. Should you buy bitcoin before the halving? Instead of trying to understand when to buy and sell bitcoin, it’s advisable to understand the value of the asset. That said, a pattern has played out in the past where buying 6-12 months before the halving and selling 12-18 months after the halving tends to return a sizable profit. Past performance and behavior is not a guarantee of future performance. Our best advice to those who are not experienced traders would be to buy and hold for many cycles.","category":["Guides"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e18d","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/spot-bitcoin-etf-issuer-support-btc-developers-bitwise-and-vaneck","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Who Will Be The Next Spot Bitcoin ETF Issuer To Support BTC Developers After Bitwise And VanEck?","author":"Frank Corva","creation_date":"2024-04-13T02:22:26Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3NzYxMzkzMTI1MDE1/educating-the-next-wave-of-bitcoin-developers.jpg","article_summary":"Currently, less than 20% of the financial institutions that issued spot Bitcoin ETFs give back to Bitcoin Core developers.","article_detailed_content":"Of the 11 financial institutions that issued spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, only two — Bitwise and VanEck — have pledged to donate a percentage of their profits to open-source Bitcoin development. Regardless of whether large holders are harassing ETF sponsors for funding core dev, the real question is - why are only @BitwiseInvest and @vaneck_us doing so? Bitcoin is an ongoing project and core dev continues to be underfunded — nic \"bankful\" carter (@nic__carter) April 10, 2024 In considering the logic behind Bitwise and VanEck’s decision to donate to developers who maintain and update the Bitcoin protocol, it’s difficult to imagine why more spot Bitcoin ETF issuers haven’t followed suit. “While we use the language of ‘donation’ when we support devs, I think in reality it's closer to a self-investment into making the asset itself stronger,” Hong Kim, co-founder and CTO of Bitwise, wrote in an AMA thread on Stacker News. “Many people think Bitcoin just magically gets maintained, but that's not true! If you manage a large pool of Bitcoin and you take fees for doing so, then why would you not reinvest some of that into the underlying infrastructure?” For this reason, Bitwise, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (ticker: BITB), committed to donating 10% of its ETF fee profits to three different nonprofits that fund Bitcoin Core developers — OpenSats, Brink and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — for 10 years. “Brink, OpenSats and HRF were the most established nonprofits with a track record of funding Bitcoin devs — they had the proof of work, so to speak,” Kim told Bitcoin Magazine. VanEck, which issued its spot Bitcoin ETF under the name VanEck Bitcoin Trust (ticker: HODL), also sees the value in supporting Bitcoin Core developers. Hence, it promised to contribute 5% of HODL profits to Brink and it made an initial $10,000 donation to the organization. “We believe TradFi stands to gain from the efforts of Bitcoin's Core contributors,” Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck, told Bitcoin Magazine. “As we stand to profit from Bitcoin’s price increase, it makes sense that we also give back to the work of the innovators who make the chain possible,” he added. Given that it’s only sensible for spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to give back Bitcoin Core developers — those who support and further the underlying asset for their financial product — which will be next to follow Bitwise and VanEck’s lead? The development of Bitcoin and open-source scaling solutions for the protocol could benefit significantly from more of these major financial institutions donating even a small portion of the profits from their spot Bitcoin ETF fees.","category":["Business","Vaneck","News","Bitcoin core","Developers","Spot Bitcoin Etf","Bitwise"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e19a","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/how-does-a-bitcoin-loan-work-","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/how-does-a-bitcoin-loan-work-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"How Does a Bitcoin Loan Work?

In 2023, it outperformed the S&P 500, high-yield corporate bonds, and gold, soaring as much as 156 percent in a year. Today, Bitcoin demand is reaching record highs as the approval of new spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a wave of institutional interest. Although dubbed a risky and volatile asset, Bitcoin remains a profitable investment, especially for its earliest investors. When it was launched in 2009, it was practically worthless. In 2010, it traded at $0.10. By 2013, it was hitting highs of $250—a 250,000 percent growth for early investors. Those who invested in 2017 would look at gains of over 6,700 percent in 2024 as the crypto asset briefly touched $70,000 recently. With this kind of growth, it’s no wonder that investors view it as a long-term investment, preferring to “HODL\" until it reaches new price highs. However, any long-term BTC holder knows the path toward profitability isn't always smooth sailing. Sometimes, you need to sell or take profits to sustain expenses or meet emergency cash needs. As a result, you surrender part of your BTC holdings and reduce its long-term earning potential. Those intent on replenishing their Bitcoin also end up re-purchasing the asset at many times the price of the original buy. What if there were another way to gain access to much-needed funds without selling your BTC? Bitcoin loans offer a solution that provides access to liquidity without letting go of your holdings. How does a Bitcoin loan work? Here, we delve into the unique mechanics of a Bitcoin loan. We discuss how the world’s leading cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the world of finance beyond trading by providing alternative means to secure loans while retaining access to potentially higher returns in the future. Click the image to learn more. Understanding Bitcoin and Crypto Lending Bitcoin loans are a form of crypto lending. Crypto lending platforms allow BTC investors to borrow against their deposited assets. They can also lend out their BTC holdings to earn interest in crypto rewards. In 2020, crypto lending platforms began gaining significant traction. They have since expanded to hold billions in total value locked (TVL) across several platforms. You can divide crypto lending into two components. Crypto or BTC deposits that earn interest and crypto loans. Deposit accounts on such platforms behave like regular bank accounts. You can deposit BTC and earn interest. The platform can use the deposited funds to lend to borrowers or for other investments—similar to how a bank operates. Typically, crypto loans are offered as collateralized lending products. They require users to deposit a 100 percent minimum to access the loan. Some require up to 150 percent—thus becoming overcollateralized loans. How To Secure a Bitcoin Loan A Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed loan is a US dollar loan that BTC collateralizes. To secure this type of loan, you send BTC to a lending platform as collateral. In return, you receive a loan in stablecoin or US dollars. The mechanics of Bitcoin-backed loans are similar to traditional secured loans, except BTC is the collateral. Such loans eliminate the need for extensive credit checks. The steps include account creation, brief onboarding, key upload, and loan application submission. In decentralized platforms, the process could be even more straightforward. Once your BTC deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, US dollars or an equivalent in stablecoin is sent to your bank account or crypto wallet. The interest on the loan is paid in regular intervals. For example, interest payments could be due every 30 days and will go on until the loan matures. The final interest payment and the principal amount will be due upon maturity. The amount you receive is based on the value of your BTC holdings and the platform's LTV (loan-to-value) ratio. The LTV ratio is determined based on risk factors associated with the crypto market's volatility. Should the value of Bitcoin drop, the platform may require you to add more collateral to equalize the borrowed amount. If you don't add collateral, you risk liquidating your BTC holdings. Factors To Consider When Applying for a Bitcoin-backed Loan Bitcoin loans are not risk-free. While they offer many benefits, consider the following before deciding to lend out your BTC holdings: Risks associated with rehypothecation Some Bitcoin lenders mimic the processes of banks, which means your deposited BTC may be subject to rehypothecation. Rehypothecation is the process of lending out client assets posted as collateral. Thus, the BTC is put at risk. The lending platform, in turn, earns interest by utilizing your digital assets for various purposes, including re-lending. Some Bitcoin-backed loan providers lend clients' Bitcoin to third parties. With rehypothecation, the loan provider earns interest from both the borrower's interest payments and the proceeds of lending the BTC collateral to other parties. The lender passes a portion of the interest to the borrower of US dollars through a marginally lower interest rate. However, some of the borrower's collateral—or even 100 percent—is at risk. Borrowers are unaware of the counterparty risk surrounding BTC-backed loans. Their holdings are exposed to multiple layers of counterparty risk. Lenders who rehypothecated collateral, therefore, expose borrowers to risk when either party becomes insolvent. Thankfully, some BTC loan providers do not rehypothecate. It is up to the user or client to select the features of a lending platform and decide how much risk they can take on. Annual percentage rate (APR) The annual percentage rate, also known as the APR, is the yearly interest rate generated by a sum charged to borrowers or paid to investors. The APR is a percentage representing the annual cost of funds over a loan term or an investment's earned income. In other words, it annualizes the total cost of a loan. The value includes additional costs or fees associated with the transaction. APR does not factor in compounding. The APR provides platform users a bottom-line number to compare investment products and lenders. Some lending companies offer low interest rates but charge high origination fees. This feature will cause the APR to increase significantly. A higher APR means it is more expensive for the borrower when multiple loans originate in a single year. A short-term loan will promise low interest rates. However, you need to check the origination fee. It will be cheaper to take out a twelve-month loan at a slightly higher interest rate with a one-time origination fee than getting a three-month loan with a 1 percent origination fee and renewing it. LTV requirement The LTV or loan-to-value requirement must be considered when you take out a Bitcoin-backed loan. For example, a 40 percent LTV means a $10,000 loan will require $25,000 worth of BTC as collateral. The ratio aims to prevent collateral liquidations as the market price fluctuates. Some lenders offer low interest rates and lower LTV ratios. A lower LTV ratio could range from 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, the clients must deposit more BTC to access the loan. This practice is done to have the ability to lend out or rehypothecate the collateral to others. Another reason for a low LTV is that higher collateral means less risk when they lend. Collateral to principal (CTP) vs. loan to value (LTV) The CTP, or collateral-to-principal ratio, is the LTV's inverse value. For example, an LTV at 40 percent equates to a CTP of 250 percent. CTP helps users understand the current status of their collateral ratio. This value is instrumental when the BTC price drops. Tax implications Tax legislation around Bitcoin loans is still evolving. It is crucial to consult a tax professional about your possible tax obligations, even if it is reasonable to expect BTC-backed loans to be treated analogously to traditional lending practices by the IRS. The IRS declared in 2014 that virtual currencies be treated as property when it comes to tax treatment. Therefore, they trigger capital gains taxes when sold. Borrowing against Bitcoin or crypto, however, would not trigger those taxes. Nonetheless, consulting a tax expert regarding current and future tax issues with Bitcoin loans is best.

The most obvious benefit is access to liquidity without the need to sell off BTC holdings. Bitcoin loans preserve your digital asset holdings. They also save you capital gains tax as a result of not selling. Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash Moreover, BTC loans tend to offer a higher level of privacy versus those from traditional financial institutions. They don’t typically require extensive credit checks and disclosure of extensive personal information. To secure a Bitcoin loan, you will only disclose minimal information for identity verification. Another benefit of Bitcoin loans is speed. Some Bitcoin-collateralized loans can be obtained within days, hours, or even minutes. Bitcoin Loans: An Alternative To Selling Your Bitcoin Owning Bitcoin offers many advantages, including generating significant growth in your investment and having a scarce asset that doubles as a decentralized mode of payment. Hence, holders understandably think twice about selling BTC to fund urgent expenses in US dollars. However, we all need to take care of our financial needs. Bitcoin-backed loans bridge the gap between owning a profitable investment with high growth potential and temporarily meeting fiat-based expenses. Several platforms offer Bitcoin-backed loans with varying features and requirements. You must evaluate the pros and cons of each platform and use the ones that balance risk with the most significant financial benefits. As you hold your Bitcoin long-term, you can explore novel products and services that protect your wealth as they offer an avenue to meet financial needs, invest in other assets, and take advantage of business opportunities.

You don’t often see the term “Roth IRA” trending online, but in 2021, tech investor Peter Thiel made headlines for his $5 billion tax-free Roth IRA piggy bank. How did he do it? The answer is alternative investments. He used a self-directed IRA to invest in early-stage tech companies multiple times over. Is it a loophole? Possibly. But it happened, it got attention, and the IRA structure in question could come under further scrutiny. “Thiel has taken a retirement account worth less than $2,000 in 1999 and spun it into a $5 billion windfall.” – ProPublica (2021) Let’s look at six common risks associated with self-directed and checkbook IRAs, how they may apply in the context of bitcoin, and why there may be increased regulation coming in the future. But first, we need to define our terms and differentiate between IRA structures. The different IRA structures The different IRA structures can behave in an “every square is a rectangle, but not all rectangles are squares” kind of way. IRAs can be Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) regardless of custodial relationship/structure. All IRAs are custodial. A custodian, in the context of IRAs, is a licensed financial institution overseeing and administering the IRA. Brokerage and Bank IRAs Brokerage and bank IRAs are the most familiar and common types. Brokerage and Bank IRAs allow investors to invest in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities, as well as banking products (CDs, deposit accounts, etc.). Examples include your typical Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or Charles Schwab IRA. The Unchained IRA is closest to this structure in this hierarchy. Self-directed IRA (SDIRA) A self-directed IRA is a custodial IRA where the custodian allows for expanded investment options outside of or in addition to typical brokerage and bank assets (stocks, bonds, CDs, etc.). Owners of self-directed IRAs can invest in non-traditional assets like real estate, businesses, private loans, tax liens, precious metals, and digital assets. Although the IRS doesn’t have a definitive list of allowed investments, it certainly has a few that are not allowed (collectibles, life insurance, certain derivatives, S-Corps, etc.). Checkbook IRA Checkbook IRAs are a subset of self-directed IRAs. The term “checkbook IRA” is not standard, but it usually refers to a self-directed IRA that gives an account owner control of investments through a checking account, usually through an LLC conduit. The account holder can then make investments with IRA funds simply by writing a check (“checkbook control”). With the added freedom of additional investment choices comes added responsibility of administration, as well as legal ambiguity as to whether the structure still qualifies as a tax-exempt IRA. Non-checkbook self-directed IRA A subset of self-directed IRA where the custodian approves transactions before investments are made. Investors must wait for the custodian to review each potential investment and formally accept title to the underlying asset. These were commonly used for real estate and private equity investments and began regaining popularity once additional legal uncertainties arose regarding checkbook IRAs in late 2021 (discussed in section 4 below).

Liquidity Unfortunately, many self-directed assets lack liquidity, making them difficult to sell quickly. Examples include real estate, privately held businesses, precious metals, etc. If cash is ever needed for a distribution or internal expense, selling an asset fast could be a problem (which compounds into other problems, i.e., accidentally commingling funds). Self-directed IRA owners should conduct thorough due diligence on asset liquidity before committing to an investment strategy. 2. Formation and legal structure When forming a checkbook IRA, a self-directed IRA LLC is established first. Then, the LLC establishes a checking account just like any other business entity. Next, the LLC is funded by sending the IRA funds to the checking account. With the proper legal structure, the IRA owner can become the sole managing member of the LLC and have signing authority over the checking account. However, improper legal structure, registration, or titling could all cause serious problems for the tax-advantaged status of the IRA. Many checkbook IRA facilitators are competent, but errors could always lead to issues and possible disqualification/loss of the entire IRA. 3. Misreporting transactions Within a checkbook IRA, owners can fund investments quickly and freely, but this comes with the responsibility of properly following rules and self-reporting transactions. At the end of each year, the owner of the LLC will need to provide complete transaction details to its IRA custodian and submit fair market valuation (FMV) information. Without oversight into each transaction you make, a custodian is more likely to misreport income on your investments. Always ensure the custodian has accurate information to avoid accidentally breaking the law. 4. “Deemed distribution” treatment Clients looking to buy precious metals, real estate, or digital assets should know the risk of “deemed distributions” treatment. A recent United States tax court case, McNulty v. Commissioner, illustrates the considerable risks of maintaining a checkbook IRA. In the McNulty case, a taxpayer used her checkbook IRA LLC to purchase gold from a precious metals dealer. She stored the LLC’s gold at home in her personal safe. The court ruled that her “unfettered control” over the LLC’s gold without third party supervision created a deemed taxable distribution from her IRA. It is impossible to know how far a tax court will go applying “deemed distribution” treatment to any given transaction or investment within a checkbook IRA. For checkbook IRA owners that hold the keys to bitcoin in an unsupervised structure, there is a risk that the McNulty ruling could cause your entire IRA to be subject to tax. Further, since alternative investments were fairly recently (2015) added to IRS Publication 590, it’s entirely possible that the IRS and Congress could apply more scrutiny to checkbook IRAs going forward. Read more about the McNulty case and its implications. 5. Prohibited transactions All self-directed IRA owners are always prohibited from commingling personal and IRA assets or using any personal funds to improve IRA assets. “Self-dealing” is one of the most common pitfalls for self-directed account holders. For example, if you use your IRA to purchase real estate, you are not allowed to use the property yourself—not even a little bit. You cannot live there, stay there, or rent office space to yourself there. You are not even allowed to make your own repairs or provide “sweat equity.” It’s not only the IRA owner that can’t participate in any “self-dealing,” but spouses, children, and grandchildren as well. They are considered disqualified individuals, and penalties are stiff. These are stringent rules and can result in huge tax headaches if breached. I don’t intend to crush any dreams, but investing your 401k/IRA into your lakefront Airbnb vacation home and having you or your family stay there even once is a bad idea. No purchasing a rental home and renting it out to family members either. For further fun, see the IRS list of prohibited transactions here. Here are a few examples of how prohibited transactions rules could be applied to digital asset investors: Commingling personal wallets with IRA wallets Leverage without a non-recourse loan Investing in certain collectible NFTs1 6. Financing Financing within a self-directed IRA is also more complicated for several reasons: Typically, a non-recourse loan and larger down payment are needed for any property purchases. Unexpected costs and fees can add up quickly and eat into any profits. IRA-owned active businesses could run into the issue of UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax). This also affects the overlap of bitcoin mining within an IRA. Any income and expenses must remain within the IRA structure and never commingled with personal funds. For example, when the water heater goes out (real estate) or salaries need to be paid (businesses), the IRA itself must pay for those services out of the IRA’s own cash. IRA owners could be tempted to co-mingle funds temporarily as they look for short-term liquidity to solve their cash needs. What does this mean for bitcoin IRAs? The self-directed IRA space has many potential risks if not properly managed. The IRS and Congress have been paying special attention to how these structures are used and abused. Combine this with their interest in regulating digital assets, and the landscape appears ripe for further scrutiny. With that, bitcoin IRAs need a unique approach that mitigates these pitfalls. Unchained IRA is not a checkbook IRA If you’re looking to hold actual bitcoin in your IRA account, you should consider the Unchained IRA. It’s not a “checkbook IRA” where transactions must be self-reported, and Unchained uses its key in the collaborative custody setup to track inflows and outflows of IRA vaults. That visibility mechanism allows the custodian to actively monitor the IRA and therefore allows users to remain compliant with current IRA rules and regulations. There is no self-reporting required, and the non-checkbook structure helps mitigate the risk of potential pitfalls (McNulty, misreporting transactions, etc.). If bitcoin appreciates like many investors hope and expect, holding coins in an IRA structure properly is of the utmost importance.

Institutions are coming 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3lSDwNwE5Q — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 4, 2024 In recent years, Franklin Templeton has emerged as one of the earliest big institutional adopters of Bitcoin. After filing for a spot BTC ETF last year, the firm launched its Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) in January amid a wave of SEC approvals. This openness to Bitcoin continued in a recent report from Franklin Templeton's Digital Assets division in which it highlighted the rise of Bitcoin-based NFTs called Ordinals, new fungible tokens, and layer 2 protocols. Franklin Templeton tweeted that these new projects primarily drive positive momentum in Bitcoin innovation. Trading volume data shows ordinals like NodeMonkes and Runestone surpassing Ethereum NFTs. According to the report, this is providing evidence that Bitcoin provides advantages over other blockchains, and that its security, decentralization, and large user base give it an edge for mainstream adoption. Beyond NFTs, technical standards like BRC-20 and Runes are expanding Bitcoin's functionality. Along with layer 2 scaling, these developments are kickstarting a new growth and maturity phase, the Wall Street firm said. Franklin Templeton's bullish perspective reflects a broader institutional warming towards Bitcoin and its capabilities, with major players like BlackRock also embracing Bitcoin even as they openly discuss \"tokenizing\" assets.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1b5","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/111-billion-bitcoin-etfs-record-inflows-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"$111 Billion: Bitcoin ETFs See Record Volumes in March","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-03T17:59:54Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU2NDEwNjkxMjY3/wall-street-blockchain-alliance-launches-educational-platform-for-financial-markets.jpg","article_summary":"Spot bitcoin ETFs saw record trading volume of $111 billion in March, nearly triple February's total, indicating strong demand for the new products.","article_detailed_content":"Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their trading volume surge to a record $111 billion in March, nearly triple the $42 billion traded in February.

NEW: #Bitcoin ETFs saw a record volume of $111 BILLION in March. That's TRIPLE the inflows from February 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Ol1PaS8vC9 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 3, 2024 According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, March trading volume was around triple that of February and January. The massive rise indicates spot bitcoin ETFs are meeting strong demand from institutional and retail investors. He stated, \"I can't imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.\" BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) led the pack, capturing 50% of the total volume. Grayscale's GBTC took second place with 20%, while Fidelity's FBTC followed at 17%. Balchunas declared IBIT the \"$GLD of bitcoin,\" referring to the mammoth SPDR Gold ETF. He said its March victory makes IBIT the undisputed leader among bitcoin ETFs. The surge in trading activity aligns with Bitcoin's climb to new all-time highs in March. However, it also suggests spot ETFs are altering market dynamics and driving new demand. Critics initially argued bitcoin markets would shrug off the new products. Yet flows into funds like IBIT and FBTC have been overwhelmingly positive. Demand is vastly outpacing bitcoin mined. ETFs bought around 66,000 BTC in March, while miners only produced 28,500. This supply-demand imbalance seems poised to grow as more investors get exposure through ETFs and newly mined coins get cut in half in two weeks during the bitcoin halving event. With strong inflows, assets under management, and trading activity, these new regulated instruments have firmly established themselves within Bitcoin markets. If March was any indication, their rise is only just beginning.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1c4","guid":"https://cryptoslate.com/?p=411976","article_link":"https://cryptoslate.com/us-court-hands-down-historic-sentence-for-smart-contract-hacker/","website_source":"cryptoslate","article_title":"US court hands down historic sentence for smart contract hacker","author":"Oluwapelumi Adejumo","creation_date":"2024-04-13T02:02:36Z","thumbnail_image":"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jail.jpg","article_summary":"A US court has sentenced Shakeeb Ahmed to three years in prison for hacking two separate decentralized crypto exchanges and stealing digital assets worth over $12 million, according to an April 12 statement from the US Department of Justice.

The sentencing marks the first time someone has been convicted for hacking a smart contract. US attorney Damian Williams said: “No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks.” Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit approximately $12.3 million and a significant quantity of crypto and pay over $5 million in restitution to the unnamed crypto exchange and Nirvana. The hacks In 2022, Ahmed hacked the smart contracts of two decentralized crypto exchanges, including Nirvana and an unnamed protocol, for a substantial amount of a digital asset. The DOJ said Ahmed manipulated pricing data on the unnamed platform to siphon approximately $9 million in inflated fees and withdrew the funds in crypto. Subsequently, Ahmed agreed to return around $7.5 million under the condition that the exchange refrains from involving law enforcement. Shortly after, Ahmed targeted Nirvana Finance, stealing about $3.6 million. According to the DOJ, Ahmed exploited Nirvana’s smart contracts to purchase crypto at lower prices from the exchange and sold it at higher prices. Despite the exchange offering a $600,000 bounty, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million, leading to a stalemate and the retention of all stolen funds, culminating in the exchange’s closure. Subsequently, Ahmed laundered the stolen digital assets using sophisticated techniques such as token-swap transactions and advanced crypto mixers like Samourai Whirlpool. At the time of these thefts, Ahmed was a senior security engineer for an unnamed international technology company.

Youssef and the global team at NoOnes are on a mission to end financial apartheid and to unite the financially disenfranchised around the world. In the process, they’re taking on the old financial guard, driven by the belief that when people can trade freely with one another using bitcoin, the oppressive powers that be will lose their leverage over those living in developing economies. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: What is the primary mission of NoOnes? Ray Youssef: It's the world's first peer-to-peer distributed nation. I see myself as a chief advocate, not just CEO — someone that is representing the people. We want to onboard a billion citizens in the next six years. By citizens, I mean engaged customers. They're not just using it once every two weeks. They have to be deeply engaged for this to be victorious. That means a billion daily engaged people. It's an amazing number when you consider Binance has 120 million users and about 2-3% of them are probably monthly active. We're trying to get a hundred times that. Corva: How many people are currently using it? Youssef: We have about 400,000 active users, which is pretty amazing. My old company had like a quarter million active [users]. The goal here is not just to get empty signups. The goal here is to make people active. Corva: You’ve talked about how apps like NoOnes and Bitcoin can help end “financial apartheid.” Could you define this term? Youssef: Financial apartheid is the most evil form of apartheid. It's invisible chains that have basically kept the vast majority of the world poor for over a hundred years, and people aren't even aware [of it]. It manifests in so many different ways. Broken overregulation [is one form of it]. Africa is the most overregulated region of the world. M-Pesa is the top mobile wallet in Kenya. 98.8% of Kenyans have an M-Pesa wallet. M-Pesa is so big it’s expanded beyond Kenya to Ghana, South African and other African countries, but you still can't send money from an M-Pesa wallet in Kenya to an M-Pesa wallet in Ghana or South Africa. You are trapped in the economy where your passport was issued. You can't access liquidity in other countries, and they can't access liquidity in your country. The problem gets even worse when you consider commerce between companies. Pan-European trade is at 69%. In Asia, I think it’s 59%. Latin America drops down to 30%. And Africa, officially it's at 13%. But guess what? The real number is less than 1%. Because in that 13%, they count all these American and Western corporations that just have local names. Intracontinental African trade is at less than 1%. If that doesn't scream financial apartheid, what does? Corva: Speaking of Africa, let's discuss what's happening in Nigeria. The government took two Binance executives hostage. In response, Binance has stopped supporting the Naira and has shut down its P2P trading platform in Nigeria. NoOnes is currently enabling Binance P2P traders to transfer their P2P trading profiles from Binance to NoOnes. How is this going? Youssef: Traders are very happy to have their feedback imported over. It's very important. Reputation is huge in this business, especially if you're an OTC trader. [So,] we made a special landing page for all the peer-to-peer refugees. They're very happy to come over and be able to talk to the CEO directly in a Telegram and WhatsApp channel. That goes a long way. Binance is being torn apart by the US government right now. Why did they go for this guy (Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance’s former CEO) so hard? Were they angry he was front-running his own users? No. They didn't care about that at all. What they really cared about is that CZ and Binance allowed all of us plebs — all of us peasants out there — to have financial access through peer-to-peer trading. The fact that there's 120 million people on the same internal money transmission network and that CZ has all these off ramps to local money all over the world set them off. Remember the guy they came after before CZ? Ross. Corva: Ross Ulbricht? Youssef: Yes, sir. Peer-to-peer is the enemy, and it always has been. They've had Ross in jail for over 11 years. He just put up a website like Amazon or eBay where anyone could trade anyone with anything. [Sure,] some people sold some weed on there. For that, they made up this story about [his involvement in a murder conspiracy]. This is all garbage. This is a sweet, innocent kid. And they put him in jail for two life sentences. Corva: And Sam Bankman-Fried only got 25 years. Youssef: The only reason Sam Bankman-Fried got any time at all was because some rich people lost some money. This is the only reason that Madoff got any time at all. too. If he was robbing poor people, no one would give a damn. But Ross Ulbricht, man, they hit him with everything because they could. They wanted to send a message: “Hey, if you try to make global free marketplaces — real commerce — happen, we're going to destroy you. You don’t touch that.” And guess what? They’ve done that to bitcoin, [too]. They said, “Hey, we’ll let bitcoin exist as a store of value. If you get in good with us, we’re going to give you an ETF ticker. We’re going to get our pension funds in there. We’re going to let the price go up high. You’ll be just a little bit better off than everyone else. But you gotta give up this whole medium of exchange [thing].” We gave up literally the best thing in the world, a free system of real commerce for a store of value for just another get rich quick pump and dump. It’s actually beginning to dawn on all of us: Oh, my goodness. Roger Ver was right. Corva: I was actually just watching an interview with him on The Bitcoin Takeover. He made some interesting points that are in line with what you’re saying. Youssef: I mean, yeah, I was pissing all over Roger with all the other clowns before, too, but the dude is right. We have lost the ethos. We have lost the foundational base for what we're doing. And should they actually manage to keep bitcoin out of the picture as this medium of exchange and just keep it as a store of value, eventually we'll lose everything. If it wasn't for what's happening in the Global South, it's empty. And quite frankly, the Global South has moved over mostly to USDT on Tron. The only nation still [using] bitcoin primarily for a medium exchange is Nigeria. But the truth is, USDT on Tron is way cheaper. It doesn't have volatility. It makes a lot more sense. So, how are we going to compete with that? Corva: That’s a good question. Going back to Nigeria for a moment. NoOnes has team members on the ground who are promoting the platform in the wake of Binance P2P shutting down. Do you ever worry about their safety? How do you deal with the fact that they could easily be targeted? Youssef: Number one, I’d try to get them out of the country. And if we can't do that, then I’d ask them to keep as low of a profile as possible. We also keep something in the bank to represent them legally. I don't want anyone to go to jail for anything I do. I'm not going to play with other people's freedom or safety. But throughout this whole process, everyone's been pooping all over the Nigerian government. They're like, “These people are dumb,” and that's not helpful. There are some very smart people in the Nigerian government that know exactly what's going on, but they can't tell their own people exactly what's going on because their own people wouldn't be able to handle it or help them. Every time I talk about this on Bloomberg or CNN Africa, I say, “The governments are not the problem. There is external pressure being applied to them that we're not aware of.” And this is always the case in every one of these situations, whether it's Zimbabwe or Venezuela. I invite the government to talk anytime. Peer-to-peer is not a problem but the solution to actually correcting Nigeria's capital control imbalance. If you go to peer-to-peer traders and say, “We need you to help us get more American dollars into the government here to stabilize the price of the Naira, they're like, 'Okay, [let’s] do it for Nigeria.'” [However,] they're not going to lose money doing it. They want to make some money doing it. But if they have the choice between doing the right thing to help everyone across a long-term timeline and making a little bit less profit, they'll take that. Believe me, these people are not stupid. They know what's good for the country is good for them, and that should be leveraged. Corva: Speaking of people not being stupid, the team at NoOnes focuses heavily on education. How challenging is educating people on the ground? Youssef: I posted a video on my Twitter of one of our workshops. There were over a thousand people there. That's how much hunger there is for this. Seriously, Education is THE way and #noOnes is absolutely blowing up now !#Bitcoin to the first billion, self custody and p2p. pic.twitter.com/lEGaNlXGSE — Ray Youssef (@raycivkit) March 27, 2024 Everyone needs bullish education. What I mean by bullish education is not the one, two, threes, or even how the blockchain works. No one really cares. It's how to make money. People want to change their lives. You can move money around the world to leverage arbitrage. You can start real simple and put up an offer to buy bitcoin cheap on NoOnes and then take it and sell it on another exchange, a local exchange, whether you're in South Africa or Malawi or wherever at 10% plus. That's what some people are doing. One guy I just talked to last week was making $2,000 a month — just buying bitcoin cheaply and selling it for 9-10% of what he bought it for. He [told me], “This is how I’m paying my way through college.” He spends just five hours a week doing these trades. There's another dude in South Africa, and he identified a problem. Nigerian workers want to send money back home to mama. They can't do it because they don't have a South African bank account. So he tells them, “Deposit your cash into my South African bank account.” He just takes that cash, buys bitcoin with it, sells that Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria on the NoOnes marketplace and says, “Send a bank transfer to this guy’s mother’s bank account.” He did two peer-to-peer transactions and turned [South African] Rand into a Nigerian bank transfer, and the people on the ground are super happy they didn't have to do it themselves. They just put money in the bank, gave him his mom's bank account number. He did all the work. He's banking and making profit. He started his own remittance corridor. He's basically Western Union for the very specific corridor of South Africa to Nigeria. Corva: These are incredible stories. When I think about NoOnes, I think about people around the world gaining access to bitcoin, not necessarily becoming entrepreneurs using the platform. It’s great to hear that P2P bitcoin trading enables this. Youssef: Absolutely. We are in the middle right now of the peer-to-peer revolution. It started with the internet. We got all these mobile devices and all these startups that disrupted everything except finance. Then, we got peer-to-peer electronic cash. Now, we're fighting for the soul of it as a [medium] of exchange. Peer-to-peer marketplaces are the last step. That's what they put Ross Ulbricht in jail for. That's what they put CZ in cuffs for. They don't want someone actually finishing it, completing the peer-to-peer revolution. We're going to the mom and pops, the farmers markets, but if the money isn't peer-to-peer, none of it will stick. Once we’ve gone peer-to-peer, what power do they have?

One of the longest running criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not possible to make arbitrary programs to control how money is spent or locked. Bitcoin only has a very limited amount of programmability in its scripting language, and the primitives available are extremely constrained. You can check a signature, you can add a timelock to something, you can manipulate data in a few simple ways, but that’s it. You can program a Bitcoin UTXO to require a signature check, a timelock verification, etc. But you cannot program it to unlock based on any arbitrary conditions. Robin’s insight with BitVM was that one single primitive in the field of computing could be enforced in Bitcoin script: a NAND gate, one of the basic primitives of computing at the physical/electrical level. Every computation that is possible can be constructed out of NAND gates. Script can actually verify a NAND gate due to a neat trick using OP_BOOLAND and OP_NOT. OP_BOOLAND is an AND operation, the opposite of NAND. OP_NOT takes a binary 1 or 0 value and inverts it. This together allows you to actually enforce a single NAND operation in script directly. In combination with hashlocks, a NAND gate script can be made where each input and output field has two possible hashlocks to “unlock” that spending path, each one pushing a 1 or 0 to the stack to perform the NAND operation. Each script also has a path where if you can reveal both preimages to a single bit value, you can immediately claim the funds. This is so that once someone decides what to input to the NAND gate, they cannot change their mind without losing money. A massive amount of NAND gate scripts can all be compacted into a taproot tree, and once someone commits to the bit values off-chain to input to that computation, the other party can challenge them on any individual step in the computation to prove it is being executed correctly on chain. Each “challenge” allows the challenged party to prove that the individual gate was computed correctly, otherwise the other party can claim the funds after a timelock. Going back and forth like this if a computation is contested, it is guaranteed that the cheating party will eventually be caught and lose funds. The limitations The main limitation of BitVM is that only the people involved in creating a BitVM contract can participate, and the roles are very limited. There is the prover, the person asserting how the computation happened off-chain, and the verifier, the person who can challenge the computation and force it to be proven on-chain if the prover does not complete the computation off-chain or tries to lie about the results. One of the reasons for designing BitVM was to establish two way pegs to sidechains or other systems. The scheme offers a very powerful primitive in that use case, the ability to actually enforce funds be given to one party or the other based on the correctness of an arbitrary computation, i.e. a validity check on whether a pegout is valid according to a sidechains rules. The problem is, only the people who hold keys to that BitVM UTXO can actually go “Hey, you’re cheating!” when someone is, and engage in the challenge protocol. This ultimately makes the system still trusted. Another limitation is that the challenge response protocol can be very long. If someone realizes the outcome of the computation is going to result in them losing money and they stop responding, the verifier has to essentially guess where the individual NAND gate is in the computation that the prover would have to lie at and reveal both preimages to a bit that would give the verifier the funds. Until that specific gate is challenged on-chain, the prover can still respond correctly to a challenge and drag it out. This can be very time consuming and inefficient. Some improvements to this design have been made since the original proposal to allow for multiple verifiers to exist in the system with the prover, to create a 1-of-n trust model where only a single verifier is required to challenge a dishonest prover. However, this requires the instantiation of multiple BitVM instances in parallel to accomplish, and therefore increases the inefficiencies with the original two party design. BitVM 2 Robin recently proposed a design scheme for BitVM 2. This scheme seeks to make a few trade offs in comparison to the original design for the benefit of mitigating its two major shortcomings. BitVM 2 shortens the challenge/response protocol length from an indeterminate series of transactions that could be upwards of dozens in the worst case scenario, to two rounds in the challenge/response. In addition to this, with the use of connector outputs it allows anyone to act as a verifier. It does not require someone to be a member involved in establishing the BitVM to challenge a dishonest prover. The fundamental shift here is moving away from directly using script NAND gates to implement the raw computational trace directly, and moving to using them to implement a general SNARK zero knowledge proof verifier (one of the core primitives Robin intended from the start to implement using BitVM). Instead of putting the raw input into the raw computational trace, and running it gate by gate in their own tapleaf scripts, the input of the BitVM 2 instance would simply be a zero knowledge proof input in combination with an asserted output of the computation. In addition to abstracting away the computation implementation with a ZKP, the tapleaf scripts are being massively expanded from a single NAND gate per leaf to an entire sub-function of the ZKP verifier. Instead of the challenge response protocol being based around the verifier guessing at which NAND gate the prover attempted to cheat at, selectively challenging at a single gate, the verifier can prove an entire sub-function’s output is invalid according to the input. Just like BitVM 1, the contract is pre-negotiated using pre-signed transactions and branching scripts. Funds pegged into the BitVM are sent to an n-of-n multisig which signs two possible execution transactions, one in which no challenge occurs, and one in which a challenge occurs. To start the process of executing the contract, the prover initiates a kick off transaction. This kick off transaction commits to the output value ‘y’ they claim the computation produces, and includes three outputs: a timelocked output that is included in the no challenge execution transaction, a connector output A, and a connector output B, both of which also are spent in the no challenge transaction. Here is where the design allows for anyone to participate as a verifier. Connector output A has a second pre-signed transaction that can spend it, the challenge transaction. This is a pre-signed transaction that pays the prover a bond in bitcoin, but the connector output A is not enough to fund it. Literally anyone can add their own inputs to fund the transaction and spend connector output A, which invalidates the no challenge withdrawal transaction for the prover (one of the inputs it needs no challenge exists). This forces the challenge path. Connector output B is also spendable using a pre-signed transaction, the assert transaction, to the output of every sub-function in the entire BitVM 2 contract. This requires a large transaction with a lot of data, but remember, the ultimate output ‘y’ the prover is claiming the computation produced was already committed to in the kick off transaction. This creates two outputs. One is a timelocked output, the other is a connector output C. Both of these outputs, in addition to the original pegged in funds, are all spent in the second successful withdrawal transaction for the prover after the timelock. Connector output C is also spendable by anyone who can prove that any sub-function output in the BitVM 2 contract produces an invalid output. This requires a very large transaction, because the script necessary to prove an entire section of the BitVM computation is incorrect is massive, but in this single transaction a verifier can claim the coins in the connector output with a valid proof. This invalidates the second withdrawal transaction for the prover and effectively burns the coins. The only way to recover them at this point is if the prover and all of the verifiers in the original n-of-n funding multisig all cooperate to recover them (in the case of a setup ceremony involving key deletion this recovery possibility does not exist). Connector output B in the kick off transaction can also be spent after a much longer timeout than no challenge withdrawal to invalidate both the no challenge and the assert transaction, burning the pegged coins. This reduces what could be a ridiculous chain of transactions in the original BitVM proposal to enforce the correct contract outcome, to at most four transactions (although admittedly very massive ones), while in the process making the set of verifiers for the BitVM 2 instance literally anyone with bitcoin who will fund the challenge transaction. BitVM 2 could wind up being a significant breakthrough in regards to the wave of rollups and other layer 2s aiming to use BitVM as a two way peg. The operator of a rollup (the prover in the BitVM) can use their own funds to cover withdrawals of users who have pegged into the system, and periodically withdraw those funds from the BitVM to compensate themselves. Any user or interested party would then be able to penalize them by burning their funds if they could produce proof the operator was not processing all withdrawals correctly. It is important to note that ultimately the security of a BitVM 2 instance is backstopped by the n-of-n keyholder, even though people not participating in it can still challenge the prover as a verifier. But because the prover has an efficient exit in the case of no challengers, and anyone can fund the challenge transaction to act as a verifier, the n-of-n funding multisig could follow a setup and key deletion ceremony similar to the Zcash launch to improve its security. BitVM 2 will probably wind up being a significant breakthrough in terms of improving the flexibility and trust model of two way pegs that make use of BitVM. Once again, Robin has proven himself a real wizard.","category":["Robin Linus","BitVM","BitVM 2","Technical","Opinion"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1d7","guid":"https://bitcoinist.com/?p=293994","article_link":"https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-takes-lead-outpacing-warren/","website_source":"bitcoinist","article_title":"Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Takes The Lead, Outpacing Warren In Pivotal Senate Contest","author":"Ronaldo Marquez","creation_date":"2024-04-13T07:00:12Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Downloader.la-66195f1893226.jpg?fit=640%2C360","article_summary":"John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and crypto advocate, is running for a seat in the US Senate against Elizabeth Warren, known for her skepticism on cryptocurrencies, when US regulators are stepping up their enforcement actions and crackdowns on the crypto industry.

Notably, Deaton’s campaign has gained significant support from industry leaders, indicating a growing demand for change in crypto regulation frameworks and a shift in approach towards the industry. Crypto Industry Backs Pro-XRP Lawyer’s Senate Campaign According to a local report from Boston, Deaton, running as a Republican candidate, has personally loaned his campaign $1 million, showcasing his commitment to his uphill battle against Senator Warren. Since announcing his candidacy in mid-February, Deaton has also raised $360,690 from individual contributors, leaving him with nearly $1.4 million cash on hand. According to the Federal Election Commission, Deaton outraised Warren in the race’s first quarter, with Deaton raising a total of $1.36 million to Warren’s $1.1 million. Notable donations have come from influential figures such as Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum; Anthony Scaramucci, former communications director for Donald Trump and vocal crypto investor; and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of Gemini exchange. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s executive chairman and co-founder, Chris Larsen, also contributed the maximum $6,600 each, split between the primary and general election campaigns, underscoring Deaton’s support from key industry players. However, it should be noted that Deaton faces a challenging campaign against Warren, who has a significant financial advantage with $4.4 million in her campaign war chest. This solidifies her position as the “heavy favorite” to win the Senate battle against the pro-XRP attorney in what is considered a “reliably blue state.” High-Stakes Senate Race A spokesperson for Warren emphasized that her campaign is powered by “small-dollar donations,” emphasizing grassroots support rather than “special interests attempting to elevate candidates.” Nevertheless, Deaton’s challenge against Warren extends beyond a political rivalry, representing the ongoing debate surrounding the role of cryptocurrencies and their regulation in the United States. Deaton has previously stated, “Regular people are sick and tired of different rules being applied to Washington insiders. We need real leadership in Washington, DC.” Deaton, an ex-US Naval officer from Detroit who attended Eastern Michigan University and New England Law Boston, moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island in late January, shortly before he announced his Senate candidacy. While Warren’s record of service and establishment support pose significant challenges, the crypto industry’s endorsement and call for change, coupled with the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, gives Deaton significant leverage in his campaign. The outcome of this high-profile race will not only determine a political representative but also shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. As of this writing, XRP is trading at $0.59, marking a significant drop in value over the past month. The cryptocurrency has seen losses of up to 12.4% over the past 30 days.

Ficco said the IRS has seen an increase in “pure crypto tax crimes” that fall under Title 26 of the US Code, which includes federal income tax violations. Crimes considered pure tax crimes involve failing to report income from crypto sales and hiding or shielding one’s actual basis in crypto. The issue will likely persist. Ficco observed an “uptick” in tax-reporting crimes and expects the IRS to bring forward more charges this year and in the future. Until recently, IRS investigations have primarily been a part of broader investigations into crypto crimes such as scams and embezzlement. Ficco acknowledged that crypto is “becoming more pervasive” and will “maintain or probably have a larger part” in broader crimes such as phone scams, romance scams, and pig butchering. Crypto scams are distinct from tax-reporting crimes. Reporting failures widespread Ficco’s comments come after the IRS published a reminder that individuals must report taxes if they sold crypto, received crypto as payment, or engaged in other crypto transactions. The IRS has included some form of tax reporting rules for crypto investors since at least 2014, but past reports suggest that reporting failures remain high. A 2023 report from Divly found that in the US, just 1.62% of investors paid taxes on crypto as required. The US rate is only slightly above the global average of 0.53%. IRS enforcement efforts around crypto could become especially strong starting this year. In February, the agency hired two experts to focus on crypto, and past reports from CNBC suggest that tax professionals are preparing for a “tidal wave” of scrutiny. Ficco’s predecessor, Jim Lee, also suggested an increased focus on tax issues in December 2023. Lee said half of 2023’s then-active crypto investigations involved tax issues.

The decline mirrored a broader selloff across asset classes amid heightened global economic uncertainties and geopolitical risks. Bitcoin has slightly recovered since the violent drawdown, trading at around $67,300 as of press time, based on CryptoSlate data. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, fell 12% to $3,100 before paring some losses to close 8% lower at $3244 as of press time. Meanwhile, BNB and Solana (SOL) dropped almost 14% before recovering some losses. Both tokens were down roughly 12% over the past 24 hours as of press time — trading at $593 and $153, respectively. Smaller cryptocurrencies faced even steeper declines, with tokens like Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recording losses ranging from 15% to 20%. The crypto market’s downturn triggered one of the largest leverage washouts of the month, erasing approximately $850 million in leveraged derivatives positions, with CoinGlass data indicating that $770 million of these were long positions expecting price increases. Traditional stock markets also suffered losses as investors feared an escalation in Middle Eastern conflicts following warnings from US officials about potential aggressive actions by Iran against Israel. This uncertainty drove investors toward safer assets, boosting Treasury bonds and the US dollar. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 each dropped about 1.7%. Gold prices briefly soared to an all-time high of over $2,400, and oil prices increased by 1%. Ryze Labs commented on the day’s events, forecasting continued volatility for cryptocurrencies in the short term due to the upcoming tax season. Despite the immediate market jitters, the firm maintains a positive long-term view, anticipating that an easing monetary policy and a slowdown in quantitative tightening might stabilize and boost the crypto sector. As global markets navigate through economic indicators and geopolitical tensions, the crypto sector remains particularly sensitive to such developments, preparing for possible further fluctuations as it approaches tax season and beyond.

Allegedly, the companies participated in an elaborate scheme that resulted in the loss of AU$ 160 million, worth $104 million, from investors. ASIC After Unlicensed Mining Companies The Australian regulator commenced civil procedures against the NGS Group companies and their directors, Brett Mendham, Ryan brown, and Mark Ten Caten. The NGS Blockchain crypto mining companies include NGS Crypto, NGS Digital, and NGS Group. ASIC alleges that the NGS companies targeted Australian investors to acquire blockchain mining packages with a fixed-rate return. The regulator also accuses the companies of allegedly encouraging investors to use self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and convert the money into crypto. According to the NGS Crypto website, the company was formed in 2018 as a blockchain firm. As part of the NGS Group, the firm “aims to help members generate consistent returns.” The Australian regulator stated in their press release that these financial services are being provided without the proper licensing. Due to this, ASIC is seeking “interim and final injunctions against the NGS Companies.” ASIC Chair Joe Longo urged Australian users to consider the risks involving self-managing the SMSFs before using the funds to invest in crypto-related investment products like those offered by the NGS Group. Moreover, ASIC’s Chair warned the industry about the regulator’s standard to scrutinize crypto products: These proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinised by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers. The Australian regulator applied to the Federal Court to designate liquidators responsible for the companies’ digital assets. The request was made because the regulator believed the investor’s assets were “at risk of dissipation.” On Wednesday, the court approved the request and prevented Mendham from leaving the country. The preliminary investigations revealed that over 450 Australians invested AU$62 million, approximately $41 million, through the NGS Companies. Crypto Funds Busted For Irregularities Similarly, over 100 investors are owed over AUD$ 100 million, around $64.6 million, by the now-collapsing DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund. Recently, investigations started after investors denounced the crypto funds operated by Ash Balanian, an alleged former NASA mission scientist. As a result, liquidators were appointed to the three companies managed by Balanian. Per the report, the fund was geared at wealthy investors, requiring a minimum deposit of AU$ 50,000. Investors discovered irregularities in the fund’s management, which resulted in the authorities’ involvement. Numerous investors were concerned as they considered that the funds failed to hold the required licenses and “breached managed investment scheme requirements.” On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Court ordered the freezing of Balanian’s assets, worth AU$55 million, and the crypto fund manager to hand over his passport.","category":["Crypto News","asic","Australia crypto adoption","australian crypto firms","australian regulator","Crypto Funds","crypto mining","Crypto mining firms"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1db","guid":"https://beincrypto.com/?p=500659","article_link":"https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-defi-lending-protocol/","website_source":"beincrypto","article_title":"Ripple Steps Into DeFi, Announces XRP Lending Protocol","author":"Oluwapelumi Adejumo","creation_date":"2024-04-15T02:45:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bic_Ripple_space_general_positive.png","article_summary":"Ripple's XRPL proposed native lending protocol would enable direct lending and borrowing of fungible tokens like XRP, wBTC, and wETH.

Notably, the protocol allows participants to contribute fungible tokens such as XRP, wBTC, and wETH to a lending pool to earn interest. The platform would also allow loan terms to be negotiated off-chain and then securely recorded on-chain. This streamlined process would facilitate user engagement and ensure transparency and security. “The Lending Protocol enables fixed-term loans with pre-set terms for interest-accruing loans. It bypasses the need for collateral by using off-chain underwriting, risk management, and a first-loss capital protection scheme in case of default,” RippleX added.

While the proposal undergoes review and refinement, there is optimism regarding its potential impact on the XRP. Ripple CTO David Schwartz said it could introduce a new utility layer without deterring traditional finance entities from its use. “If passed, this could bring new utility to the XRPL. Together with the native DEX, this lending protocol forms a critical pillar in enabling more accessible, efficient, and transparent financial services,” Schwartz remarked. However, Schwartz also conceded that some companies might be reluctant to use the feature. He said these firms would be concerned about participating in an unregulated lending product.

Thailand Authorities Target Crypto Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Regulations to Combat Online Fraud","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Thailand Authorities Target Crypto Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Regulations to Combat Online Fraud Authorities in Thailand are targeting peer-to-peer (P2P) trading as part of broader efforts to tackle online fraud in the country. In a meeting, several state agencies called for regulating P2P crypto trading and digital asset purchases to protect people from financial loss. Thailand to Prevent Scammers from Cleaning Money via P2P Trades In attendance were representatives from several agencies, including the Defense Ministry, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission, the Royal Thai Police, and the Bank of Thailand. Others were the Department of Special Investigation, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Thai Bankers’ Association, the Interior Ministry, the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, and the Department of Special Investigation. The meeting was led by the Thai Minister for Digital Economy and Society, Prasert Jantararuangthong. The participants met following a recent order from Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. The Prime Minister gave agencies 30 days to disclose plans to crack down on growing online fraud. According to a Bangkok Post publication, online scammers take the proceeds from their illicit activities and pass them through crypto exchanges and trading platforms via P2P trading. This helps to minimize the risk of being traced, making it difficult for authorities to find and prosecute scammers. According to Prasert’s ministry, 80% of the 100 million baht ($2.7 million) worth of daily fraud recorded in Thailand passes through P2P channels. The ministry believes this is an easy way for fraudsters to clean the money because these fund transfers are unregulated. The Minister tasked the SEC with finding ways to regulate P2P trades to prevent money laundering. No VAT for Crypto in Thailand According to the SEC, there are 2 million crypto accounts held by individuals in Thailand. Current regulations focus on regulating crypto trading, especially targeting unauthorized exchanges. The new effort is to widen regulatory activities to ensure that P2P trading is scrutinized as part of current efforts. However, Prasert assures that registered platforms will not be targeted: “The move to regulate the P2P platform would not affect cryptocurrency traders on authorized exchanges.” The Minister plans to offer a regulation scheme to the Prime Minister if the SEC cannot modify existing regulations. In addition to P2P trading, the agencies also hope to tackle online fraud and call center scams. Thailand is working on establishing the country as a digital asset hub. In February, the Ministry of Finance excluded crypto trading from value-added tax (VAT) requirements to encourage the use of digital assets. According to the Finance Minister’s secretary, Paopoom Rojanasakul, the vision is to support crypto adoption to drive the digital economy. The ministry waived the 7% tax earlier imposed on the crypto sector, effective January 1. Initially, for authorized crypto exchanges, the waiver now extends to all brokers and dealers under the SEC’s purview. For regulations, the SEC and Finance Ministry are currently modifying the country’s 2019 Securities and Exchange Act. The agencies want to better regulate crypto use and investment by classifying digital investment tokens as securities.next Thailand Authorities Target Crypto Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading Regulations to Combat Online Fraud","category":["Altcoin News","Cryptocurrency News","News","nbtc","thailand sec"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e232","guid":"https://themerkle.com/?p=80521","article_link":"https://themerkle.com/pendle-token-sees-7-decline-following-all-time-high-on-chain-activity-reflects-positive-sentiment/","website_source":"themerkle","article_title":"Pendle Token Sees 7% Decline Following All-Time High, On-Chain Activity Reflects Positive Sentiment","author":"Will Izuchukwu","creation_date":"2024-04-13T06:01:15Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"Pendle, the decentralized finance (DeFi) token, experienced a notable decline of over 7% today, following a surge to an all-time high of $7.5 yesterday.

This is after news that Hong Kong is likely to approve its first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as soon as early next week. Bitbot (BITBOT) is nearing the $2.3 million mark in presale amid investor interest. Bitcoin is trading up, currently green as price hovers above $70,900. The leading cryptocurrency’s potential to break out to a new all-time high has received a new boost as reports emerge Hong Kong is set to approve its first spot Bitcoin ETFs. BTC’s upside flip is likely to push other altcoins higher, and one of the new tokens attracting the most attention is Bitbot (BITBOT). Is Bitcoin (BTC) set to explode next week? There are reports that Hong Kong could approve the first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the region as early as Monday. A Bloomberg report on Friday quotes sources as saying that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is set to give it nod, just days after major Chinese funds applied to issue spot Bitcoin ETFs. While Hong Kong’s decision is not officially communicated as of writing, there’s growing positivity in the market already. In January 2024, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin ETFs, the price of BTC skyrocketed amid massive demand. BTC reached its ATH of $73,737 in March, riding halving and spot ETFs sentiment. The SEC has called for public participation on spot ETH ETFs. Today’s news has seen the bellwether crypto flip from lows of $69,500 to currently trade above $70,900. Ethereum has also gained slightly, currently hovering above $3,520. Should the ETFs draw inflows as witnessed with BlackRock’s IBIT and others, there’s potential for BTC, ETH and other coins to rally in coming weeks. Also likely to attract investor are new tokens that could tap into the overall market strength and specific fundamentals to emerge as top performers in the market in 2024 and beyond. Bitbot: Pioneering non-custodial trading bot on Telegram BitBot is the pioneering non-custodial crypto trading bot, poised to enter the crypto market at a time traders are keen on available opportunities. While competing Telegram trading bots are custodial solutions – that is they control users’ private keys and thus hold their assets – Bitbot takes the approach of ‘not your keys, not your assets.” In short, Bitbot is where a Telegram bot user has the full control of their private keys and wallet. Security is key to crypto traders, who unfortunately have had to learn the hard way given incidents involving top bots such as Unibot and Banana Gun. By focusing on security through its partnership with Knightsafe, Bitbot has taken an early lead against potential rival trading apps. Bitbot app’s AI capabilities add to the superior outlook, with users able to access all the advanced institutional-grade trading tools that make trading via bots such a huge market in the crypto space. Bitbot offers all of these, including trade sniping, gem scanner, copy trading and automated execution, without compromising on user security and convenience. Bitbot presale surpasses $2.2 million amid investor interest The native BITBOT token is in presale and users will get access to benefits such as revenue-sharing, trading discounts and airdrops. Presale participants can buy BITBOT at the still heavily discounted price of $0.0155 in stage 10. Early bird investors have pushed the presale to near $2.3 million.

Firms are accumulating money in a mad dash, and reinvesting it to prepare for the imminent halving.","article_detailed_content":"The below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Bitcoin Magazine's premium markets newsletter. To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. With Bitcoin’s next halving set to take place this month, miners are using record profits to adapt their business models for chaotic opportunities. The halving is almost upon us. As the whole world of Bitcoin waits with bated breath for mining rewards to be cut in half, the potential for new revenue streams has left us wondering how the space will react to new market conditions. Halvings in the past have generally been associated with prosperity for Bitcoin, but they’ve also been known to shake up previously-held assumptions in a big way. We’re already seeing a few examples of these market changes; just to name one, the larger miners have been modernizing their equipment to ensure maximally efficient hardware. This has led to a fire sale of outdated equipment from these companies, with many thousands of mining rigs finding their way to aspiring miners in Africa and Latin America. The cheap hydroelectricity from Ethiopia has already been attracting international capital to become a new mining hub, and a large portion of these rigs are going there for pennies on the dollar. In other words, miners are expecting to see less output in the immediate future, but this has nevertheless incentivized the creation of new mining companies worldwide and net growth for the industry. This is just one illustration of the sorts of unexpected opportunities that will take the digital asset space by storm, and it’s up to Bitcoiners to seize on them. For miners as a whole, opportunities are certainly plentiful. March 2024 saw the highest ever monthly revenues for the collective mining industry, just topping $2 billion. This is particularly noteworthy because less than half of this revenue has come from transaction fees, a far cry from the situation in December where transaction fees outpaced mining rewards. In December, the price of Bitcoin was far lower, and the blockchain was plagued with congestion. Not only did this congestion suppress the demand for buying Bitcoin, but it also raised the demand for miners to process the blockchain. Simply resolving transactions on already-mined Bitcoin made up a larger share of profits than mining and selling new ones, and this enterprise became a lifeline for many smaller firms. Now, however, it seems like the money is flowing all around. Bitcoin ETFs are gobbling up Bitcoin at extreme rates—more than 6x the actual output of miners. The bonanza has even brought venture capital interest squarely back into focus, further increasing the frenzy. In the first three months of 2024, major exchanges collectively saw their reserves of Bitcoin drop by nearly $10 billion, revealing the immense demand for newly-mined coins. With market conditions like this, it’s no wonder that miner profits have hit an all-time record. Source However, although this period of intense sales has certainly created an opportunity for the miners, there are also perils associated with the halving. These companies are in a mad dash to secure as much revenue as possible pre-halving, and the race is so desperate for one simple reason: trendlines may give encouraging data, but there’s no actual guarantee that Bitcoin’s price will climb accordingly after its supply is cut down. Halving hype and the runaway success of ETFs have brought Bitcoin’s price to its highest levels, but this record has been followed by volatility. Bitcoin has hovered around its great benchmark ever since passing it without continuing to rally in a bombastic spike. If Bitcoin’s price continues to behave in unexpected ways, it will eventually wreak havoc on smaller firms and promote industry consolidation. Additionally, a particularly interesting development has emerged in the secondary Bitcoin markets. Since the rapacious demand of ETF issuers and other financial institutions has completely outpaced supply, some long-term holders (LTHs) have been awakening to fears of a generalized liquidity crisis. Whales previously content to hold Bitcoin for years at a time have changed their behavior, evidently deciding that now is the time to finally realize massive profits. March 2024 has seen long-term holders begin selling their assets at unprecedented rates, raking in a disproportionate amount of profit in relation to other Bitcoin sellers. Obviously, a resource like this cannot last forever, but it’s an important reminder to some of the miners: just because you’re having trouble making ends meet post-halving, it doesn’t mean the industry is. Adapt, or the space will find new ways to leave you behind. Source Nevertheless, miners big and small have not taken on the challenge of the halving lying down. These runaway profits have enabled businesses to invest in a wide variety of preparation strategies, sometimes even dramatically shaking up their business models. For example, the American firm Arkon Energy has previously operated more as an infrastructure company, viewing itself as a provider for a client base of independent miners. As it announced a major purchase of state-of-the-art mining equipment on April 2nd, it joined an industry-wide trend of preparing for the halving with maximally efficient machines. Rather than offering this equipment to its previous clientele, however, Arkon has stated its intention to pivot and simply mine Bitcoin themselves. This simple shift represents a dramatic change in their overall business model, and they plan to follow through by “aiming to make Arkon one of the most efficient miners in the world”. Leading miner Hut 8, on the other hand, has initiated a business model pivot of its own, but in a slightly different direction. A Q1 earnings call in late March saw CEO Asher Genoot acknowledge that 70% of the company’s revenue came from asset mining, but that plans were expected to change somewhat as the halving approaches. Hut 8 is still focusing on upgrading its hardware and exploiting energy resources at new sites, like many other mining companies, but it’s also investing in a new direction. This new direction is not in a different asset, as its mining operations are focused on Bitcoin, but rather in developing high-performance computing and AI operations. Genoot claimed that these new operations were “sub-scale today… But we are excited about that business because we see it as a foundation to be able to grow.\" He added that “You’ll see us continuing to be creative in how we maximize the value of every machine,” stressing the need to maintain an eager and disciplined attitude toward the existing mining operations. These are just a couple of the different new strategies that miners are taking to anticipate the halving. Companies have been preparing for months now, and there is still time to make additional new plans. At the time of writing, the halving is in less than three weeks, and the countdown to this event reveals the optimistic and celebratory attitude of Bitcoiners everywhere. No matter what happens when the long-awaited day finally gets here, a few constants seem very reliable. There will be an immense demand for the world’s leading digital asset, and the Bitcoin community will have the same innovative spirit as always. Whether Bitcoin jumps right away or behaves unpredictably, it’s certain that someone will wind up a big winner. For us Bitcoiners, that means there’s plenty to look forward to.","category":["Bitcoin Magazine Pro","Markets","Bitcoin Halving"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1bc","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tether-8888-btc-600-million-bitcoin-treasury-on-chain-data","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Tether Adds 8,888 BTC Worth $600 Million to Bitcoin Treasury, On-Chain Data Shows","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-01T17:32:01Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5ODE5NDg2NjMzNjY1NjM5/tether-7172951_1280.jpg","article_summary":"Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million.","article_detailed_content":"Stablecoin issuer Tether has significantly expanded its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 8,888 BTC worth around $600 million. This latest purchase was revealed through on-chain data rather than an official announcement. Tether has not publicly disclosed its Bitcoin addresses. However, transactions tracked on the blockchain show 8,888 BTC were recently sent from the crypto exchange Bitfinex to an undisclosed Tether wallet. The recipient address now holds over 75,000 BTC worth $5.3 billion. In May 2023, Tether first revealed it was allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin, with plans to invest up to 15% of quarterly profits. \"The decision to invest in bitcoin, the world's first and largest cryptocurrency, is underpinned by its strength and potential as an investment asset,\" Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, said in the statement when they announced their Bitcoin strategy. While unconfirmed, analysts believe the identified wallet likely belongs to Tether. The amount perfectly matches its pledged buying strategy and claimed holdings in its latest financial reports. Tether has emerged as a major player in Bitcoin markets and its accumulation race. The company is now estimated to be the seventh largest holder of BTC. Its steady purchases, combined with those of institutional investors like MicroStrategy, tighten supply. Critics have raised concerns about Tether's lack of transparency and the potential market risks of its growing bitcoin stash. However, its embrace of Bitcoin also shows the asset's broadening mainstream acceptance. Tether aims to capitalize on Bitcoin's growth while diversifying its reserves away from traditional assets like government debt. Tether is one of the world's largest holders of U.S. Treasuries. This latest $600 million acquisition is unlikely to be Tether's last. As the stablecoin leader continues executing its Bitcoin investment strategy, its influence over Bitcoin markets is only set to increase.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1d3","guid":"https://bitcoinist.com/?p=294008","article_link":"https://bitcoinist.com/first-conviction-for-crypto-smart-contract-hacking/","website_source":"bitcoinist","article_title":"First-Ever Conviction For Crypto Smart Contract Hacking: Nirvana Exploiter Sentenced To 3 Years","author":"Ronaldo Marquez","creation_date":"2024-04-13T11:00:04Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Downloader.la-661973ccf03e0.jpg?fit=633%2C420","article_summary":"After orchestrating a series of hacks on two decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) that stole more than $12 million worth of crypto, former security engineer Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced today to three years in prison, this is the first-ever smart contract hacking conviction in the US.

Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit the stolen crypto and pay restitution to the affected exchanges. Engineer Exploits Crypto Vulnerabilities In $12 Million Hacks According to charging documents and court filings, Ahmed conducted two separate attacks on decentralized exchanges. In the first incident, which took place on July 2 and 3, 2022, he manipulated fake pricing data to generate approximately $9 million in inflated fees. Subsequently, Ahmed withdrew these fees in the form of cryptocurrency. Following the theft, Ahmed communicated with the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds, except $1.5 million, if the exchange did not involve law enforcement. Shortly after, on July 28, 2022, Ahmed targeted another decentralized exchange called Nirvana Finance. Exploiting a vulnerability in Nirvana’s smart contracts, he purchased crypto assets at a lower price than intended and promptly resold them back to Nirvana at a higher price. Despite Nirvana offering a substantial “bug bounty” of up to $600,000 for the return of the stolen funds, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million. This led to the collapse of the exchange, which had lost all its possessed funds, approximately $3.6 million, due to Ahmed’s attack. From Security Expert To Cybercriminal The investigation revealed that Ahmed used “advanced money laundering techniques” to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds. These included token swap transactions, transferring fraud proceeds from the Solana (SOL) blockchain to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain through “bridging,” converting the funds to Monero, and then using overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers such as Samourai Whirlpool. Ahmed, a US citizen, held a senior security engineer position at an international technology company at the time of the attacks. His resume showcased expertise in reverse engineering smart contracts and conducting blockchain audits, skills that he utilized to execute the hacks. In addition to the three-year prison term, Ahmed was sentenced to three years of supervised release. He must forfeit approximately $12.3 million, including a significant amount of cryptocurrency, and pay the affected exchanges over $5 million in restitution. Commenting on Shakeeb Ahmed’s sentencing, US Attorney Damian Williams said Today, Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to prison in the first-ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract and ordered to forfeit all of the stolen crypto. No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks.

This move comes in the wake of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) potential legal actions against the DeFi protocol. Information on the official website shows that users will have to pay a fee of 0.25% for most swaps, up from the previous rate of 0.15%. Uniswap Raises Fees to Prepare For Legal Battle Uniswap clarified that this fee adjustment aims to ensure sustainable funding for its operations. Although fee-eligible trades have seen an uptick, certain transactions, such as swapping stablecoin pairs with identical underlying assets or wrapping and unwrapping WETH, remain exempt from fees. Users can circumvent the fee by utilizing an alternative interface to access Uniswap. However, any transactions conducted on the mainnet and supported Layer 2 networks will incur the increased fee.

Consequently, market observers suggested that Uniswap’s transaction fee increase was a strategic move to bolster its financial reserves in anticipation of the potential legal proceedings from the financial watchdog. “The interface fee goes to Uniswap Labs to fund the operations of the team building out products around the protocol… Or in this case, fight a lawsuit with the SEC on behalf of the entire industry If you do not want to pay the fee, then just use an aggregator.

Tim Beiko, the Ethereum Foundation‘s protocol support lead, confirmed the development, revealing that the developers have agreed to include Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) 3074 in the network’s slated overhaul. EIP 3074 EIP 3074 is a pivotal advancement within Ethereum’s ecosystem and was introduced by Lightclients in 2020. The proposal has garnered widespread support from the crypto community as it aims to enhance the user experience (UX) of Ethereum wallets. Fundamentally, EIP 3074 enables conventional crypto wallets like MetaMask to function akin to smart contracts. This upgrade facilitates various functionalities, including transaction bundling, streamlining the signing process to a single step, and sponsored transactions. The latter feature empowers wallets to delegate funds for others to utilize, offering a more versatile and efficient transaction framework. Trading a new token on a DEX such as Uniswap will now only require one signature from a user’s wallet as opposed to having to approve the new token and then sign the transaction to purchase. Crypto community reacts The announcement of the impending upgrade has sparked various reactions within the crypto community. Georgios Konstantopoulous, Paradigm’s CTO, highlighted the update’s potential to enhance wallet usability tenfold, noting Reth’s successful implementation and testing. Echoing this sentiment, Hayden Adams, the mind behind Uniswap, lauded the upgrade as a significant boost to Ethereum’s user experience. He added: “Industry should make an effort to create compatibility for 4337 wallets to interact with 3074 contracts (much like eip1271 has created compatibility between safes and EOAs today).” However, EVM developer Alex Watts cautioned against solely focusing on user experience improvements, emphasizing the broader implications for application and mechanism design. Despite the optimism, concerns linger among some community members regarding the EIP 3074 upgrade. Ansgar Dietrich, an Ethereum Researcher involved in the proposal’s inception, expressed ambivalence, reflecting on the lengthy journey to its impending mainnet integration and questioning its alignment with the evolving account abstraction roadmap. Similarly, 0xngmi, the pseudonymous developer of DeFiLlama, raised apprehensions about the upgrade potentially enabling the complete depletion of addresses, encompassing tokens, NFTs, and other DeFi assets.

Shrimps vs Issuance: (Source: Glassnode) As the halving looms closer, the monthly issuance is set to be cut in half to 13,500 BTC. This reduction in supply, coupled with the increasing demand outpacing the monthly issuance, sets the stage for an exciting Q2.

Throughout this week, the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has shown strong volatility as we stare at Friday’s Bitcoin options expiry. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6% up on the weekly chart at $70,922 with a market cap of $1.4 trillion. As per data from Greeks.live, a staggering 21,000 Bitcoin options are set to expire having a notional value of $1.5 billion and a put call ratio of 0.62. The max pain point for the expiry currently stands at $69,000. With the US CPI data and inflation coming higher than expected, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market have experienced stronger volatility. On the other hand, the implied volatility has declined which means that in the case of volatile price movements, the BTC price can tank further under $70,000. Furthermore, the Greeks.live data shows that the sell calls have dominated the Bitcoin trade over the past month and the optimism around Bitcoin halving seems to be waning. Also, with the slowdown in the Bitcoin ETF inflows, BTC lacks enough impetus to continue with its rally ahead. As of now, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has been largely consolidating in a tight range between $69,000-$71,000. Analysts believe that it could continue to consolidate up to halving without showing any major price movements. #BTC is still just consolidating between these two levels No major trend shift as we approach the Bitcoin Halving$BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/3nYdfEN9Sd pic.twitter.com/iaAQn27Tuj — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 11, 2024 Bitcoin Faces Strong Resistance at $71,000 Over the last fortnight, the Bitcoin (BTC) price has faced a significant struggle moving past $71,000, clearly hinting at a strong bearish grip in the market. Critics speculate that the S&P 500’s recent decline from its peak of 5265 on March 28 could foreshadow an economic downturn. Given Bitcoin’s strong correlation with stocks, which surpassed 80% last month, its price might initially decline if market troubles persist. On the other hand, the BTC futures market continues to show signs of neutrality highlighting a healthy demand for leverage calls in comparison to the situation in March-end. However, any kind of excessive leverage remains a valid concern with the Bitcoin futures open interest currently standing at $34.3 billion. ⌛️🗣️ As #Bitcoin has now drawn to its final week before the #halving, social dominance toward the topic has peaked at its highest level of the year at 9pm UTC.

On day one, $4.6B in shares were traded, with cumulative trading volume exceeding the $50B mark by February 22. The ETF approval in the U.S. is expected to have a far-reaching impact across Asian markets where investment flows are already significant, especially in institutional investing, and picking up pace. The question on the minds of observers, investors, and industry participants is: “What’s next?” By taking stock of what has happened in the US and as we look East, we can better understand what to expect in markets like Hong Kong and other countries in the region. Spotlight on Hong Kong Optimism for approval exists about a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong. In January, they accepted the first application from one of China’s major asset funds, Harvest Fund Management. Although hopes existed for approval as early as Q1 2024, it wouldn’t be surprising to see it take until at least Q2. Approvals of traditional ETFs by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) typically take weeks to months. Given that Hong Kong has already approved a few crypto ETF futures funds—including the CSOP Bitcoin Futures, CSOP Ether Futures, and Samsung Bitcoin Futures—one can reasonably hope that the path to a spot ETF approval will come with time. On the face of it, giving those approvals would make sense all around. Hong Kong serves as a conduit to China’s wealth and has established a regulatory environment to go alongside the depth of its asset and wealth management sector. Plus, because Hong Kong already offers Ethereum futures, they may be more open to spot Ethereum ETFs. In comparison to the U.S., the SEC has received applications for spot Ethereum ETFs with a response required by May 23, although it was allowable earlier; on February 7, the SEC issued a delay statement. Assessing the Likelihood of Approval From Other Asian Countries The only major countries in the APAC region in which spot Bitcoin ETFs are not in any stage of development seem to be China, Thailand, and Singapore. Major Asian countries that will likely follow in the general pathway of the U.S. and Hong Kong include Japan, South Korea, and Australia; although these are relatively early days, people are already expressing interest in these products. Regulations in each country are somewhat different, and so the paths towards crypto product approvals will also differ. South Korea The country’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act is set to go into effect in July 2024. This gives South Korea’s Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea the authority to oversee crypto exchanges and custodians. Although news stories have provided conflicting information about the likelihood of spot Bitcoin approvals, two key factors point to optimism. First, politicians running for election are more open to the idea. Next, Governor Lee Bok-hyun of the Financial Supervisory Service is set to meet with the U.S. SEC’s chair, Gary Gensler, in May to discuss spot Bitcoin ETFs. At minimum, this shows South Korea’s openness to the financial product. Japan Encouraging signs also exist in Japan. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, the country’s cabinet approved a bill that permits the nation’s investment funds and venture capital companies to acquire crypto. If passed by Parliament, then this will become law. Plus, some of the country’s largest financial institutions, as part of a consortium of more than seventy Japanese companies, are expected to launch a yen-backed digital currency in July 2024 privately. This comes alongside Japan’s government pension fund recently mentioning that it is requesting information on “illiquidity assets,” such as bitcoin, as part of research into potential new investments. Although neither of these actions would directly allow a spot Bitcoin ETF, they both will play a role in creating a more crypto-friendly environment. Australia Australia’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin has “demonstrably shifted” after the SEC approval. Across demographics, positive Bitcoin sentiment increased by 25 percent while, specifically looking at people aged fifty-five and up, the news boosted Bitcoin favorability by 100 percent. Plus, this enthusiasm already has an outlet with many people in Australia able to invest in the U.S. ETFs, with predictions suggesting that the Australian Securities Exchange will soon make similar products available. It’s already highly anticipated that Monochrome Asset Management, located in Brisbane, Australia, will launch a spot Bitcoin ETF in H1 2024, with the U.S. approval possibility speeding up the approval. What’s Stopping More Regulatory-Approved Crypto Businesses? As countries create regulations and structures for crypto products worldwide, two key topics regularly arise the need for anti-money laundering (AML) rules and counter-terrorism financing (CTF). This may be especially important in Asia, where the threat of money laundering and terrorist funding is significant, Hong Kong and Singapore, for example, have strict requirements for exchanges that want to receive a crypto license. Then, transactions are stringently monitored with know your customers (KYC) procedures diligently followed. Because these are key financial centers, tripping up can have costly effects, including on the reputations of the firms that skip steps or otherwise don’t conform. In South Korea, all registered and licensed exchanges need to have a banking partner because of money laundering concerns and the related terrorist financing of North Korea. When opening a crypto account in that Asian country, banking details and KYC data are linked to the crypto exchange account for transparent fund flows to satisfy regulator concerns. For spot Bitcoin ETF approval, questions about market manipulation—a concern listed by Gensler when delaying U.S. approval—will also need to be addressed to the satisfaction of Asian regulators. Visibility is also important to allow regulators and investors to feel confident, which will help crypto products become a bigger part of the financial pie. These structures and guardrails can allay concerns and lay the foundation for further growth. Plus, safe, secure custody for crypto products must be firmly in place in Asia and worldwide. Optimism exists for all of this foundational work to occur in ways that allow Asian countries to participate in the in-demand crypto products like spot Bitcoin and spot Ether ETFs in ways that satisfy AML, CTF, and market manipulation concerns with safe and secure custody provided.

Nervos Network, along with its native token CKB, has not only recorded significant gains but has also climbed to the 79th rank in the market, raising questions about the factors behind its surge. Nervos Network Decoded Nervos Network is a proof-of-work (PoW) Layer 1 (L1) blockchain designed to optimize application-specific Layer 2 chains. The network aims to establish its native asset, CKB, as a more sustainable store of value (SoV) compared to Bitcoin (BTC) while providing a more secure smart contract platform than Ethereum (ETH). Bitcoin’s capped supply and decreasing block rewards raise concerns about long-term economic incentives for miners. Notably, the Nervos Network tackles this issue by introducing a fixed annual secondary issuance of CKBs and the base supply, providing long-term incentives for miners. Related Reading: Traders Forecast Massive Rally For Altcoins, But Why Is Sentiment “Down”? Nervos Network also addresses the potential security risk associated with Ethereum. In Ethereum, the value of its native asset, ETH, is not directly linked to the value of Layer 2 apps built on top of it. Nervos Network aims to mitigate this risk by ensuring that CKB is used for transaction fees and storage, creating a stronger economic relationship between the native asset and the overall network. How Secondary Issuance And State Rent Drive Sustainability Nervos utilizes a perpetual secondary issuance model to increase CKB’s SoV properties. This model incentivizes users to continuously lock up CKB in proportion to the size of their applications. Furthermore, locked CKBs are subject to “state rent” through inflation, which automates state rent payments and ensures a sustainable economic model. Nervos Network introduces a secondary market for chain space, enabling apps to unlock and sell CKBs without requiring relevant storage. Investors can offset inflation by purchasing CKBs and depositing them into NervosDAO, a mechanism that receives a portion of the secondary issuance to counterbalance inflation. Interestingly, this resembles “treasury bonds” and offers potential investment opportunities. Approaching ATH Amidst Bitcoin Integration Announcement Having delved into the fundamentals, CKB has recently experienced a significant surge in value, breaking out of a long consolidation phase that lasted almost two years. After trading in a range of $0.0024 to $0.0035, the cryptocurrency has broken through this price level since January 30th and has seen significant gains over the past few months. Currently trading at $0.032, CKB is close to its all-time high (ATH) of $0.043, which was reached in March 2021. The token has seen notable price increases of 47%, 69%, 75%, and 14% over the past fourteen days, seven days, and 24 hours, respectively. According to CoinGecko data, CKB has also seen a significant increase in trading volume, reaching $207 million in the last 24 hours, 9.7% from the previous day’s trading. In addition, CKB’s market capitalization has increased significantly, nearly doubling from $740 million on April 2 to approximately $1.35 billion in just over a week. Related Reading: Uniswap Bloodbath: UNI Price Crashes 16% On SEC Lawsuit Fears The price spike can be attributed to the announcement that Nervos Network’s CKB token will join the Bitcoin network. The token’s introduction of smart contract functionality, along with its interoperability and modularity features scheduled for 2024, has created excitement among investors. As Bitcoin approaches the Halving that has historically increased its value, Nervos Network is well-positioned to benefit from its strong ties to the largest cryptocurrency in the market. With its continued bullish momentum and the predicted increase in BTC’s price, CKB may be poised to reach new all-time highs soon.

In Ethereum, the value of its native asset, ETH, is not directly linked to the value of Layer 2 apps built on top of it. Nervos Network aims to mitigate this risk by ensuring that CKB is used for transaction fees and storage, creating a stronger economic relationship between the native asset and the overall network. How Secondary Issuance And State Rent Drive Sustainability Nervos utilizes a perpetual secondary issuance model to increase CKB’s SoV properties. This model incentivizes users to continuously lock up CKB in proportion to the size of their applications. Furthermore, locked CKBs are subject to “state rent” through inflation, which automates state rent payments and ensures a sustainable economic model. Nervos Network introduces a secondary market for chain space, enabling apps to unlock and sell CKBs without requiring relevant storage. Investors can offset inflation by purchasing CKBs and depositing them into NervosDAO, a mechanism that receives a portion of the secondary issuance to counterbalance inflation. Interestingly, this resembles “treasury bonds” and offers potential investment opportunities. Approaching ATH Amidst Bitcoin Integration Announcement Having delved into the fundamentals, CKB has recently experienced a significant surge in value, breaking out of a long consolidation phase that lasted almost two years. After trading in a range of $0.0024 to $0.0035, the cryptocurrency has broken through this price level since January 30th and has seen significant gains over the past few months. Currently trading at $0.032, CKB is close to its all-time high (ATH) of $0.043, which was reached in March 2021. The token has seen notable price increases of 47%, 69%, 75%, and 14% over the past fourteen days, seven days, and 24 hours, respectively. According to CoinGecko data, CKB has also seen a significant increase in trading volume, reaching $207 million in the last 24 hours, 9.7% from the previous day’s trading. In addition, CKB’s market capitalization has increased significantly, nearly doubling from $740 million on April 2 to approximately $1.35 billion in just over a week. The price spike can be attributed to the announcement that Nervos Network’s CKB token will join the Bitcoin network. The token’s introduction of smart contract functionality, along with its interoperability and modularity features scheduled for 2024, has created excitement among investors. As Bitcoin approaches the Halving that has historically increased its value, Nervos Network is well-positioned to benefit from its strong ties to the largest cryptocurrency in the market. With its continued bullish momentum and the predicted increase in BTC’s price, CKB may be poised to reach new all-time highs soon.

This has caused a suppressed price action over the last week, stopping the meme coin’s advancement in its tracks. However, the outlook still remains bullish for the DOGE price, with crypto analysts expecting the rally to continue soon and the price to double. Dogecoin Forms Bull Flag Pattern The Dogecoin performance over the past month has been quite encouraging, and despite hitting a roadblock with its rally, it has continued to show bullish tendencies. The most recent of the bullish moves which the meme coin has pulled is the formation of a bull flag pattern on its chart. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) article that the cryptocurrency’s chart had showed something interesting on the daily chart. According to the analysis, the movements that Dogecoin has made over the last few weeks has led to a bull flag formation on the daily chart. Now, the main driver of the rally that is supposed to follow this formation is the DOGE price breaking out from the bull flag, which is yet to happen. But as the crypto analyst explains, a breakout from here would send Dogecoin’s price at least 2x higher than its current level. A successful break above the $0.205 level would confirm this bullish formation. However, DOGE has been unable to achieve this, still trading below $0.2 at the time of writing. This could also be a hard-won battle for the meme coin as Bitcoin’s uncertain moves continue to drag the crypto market down. When Will DOGE Make This Move? The month of April is expected to be bullish for the Dogecoin price, and the crypto analyst’s price shows this. The expected timeframe for the bullish breakout is sometime this month, which would put it in the next few weeks. Trader Tardigrade’s target shows an over 100% increase from the current price level, reaching as high as $0.4 in the short term. This move could be spurred on by the Bitcoin halving happening this month, which is expected to propel bullish sentiment. Expectations for the Bitcoin price are that it will reach $80,000, and this move would no doubt pull up the rest of the crypto market, causing coins like Dogecoin to surge. At the time of writing, the DOGE price was trending at $0.19, with a 1.61% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly time frame, its price is up 14%, coming in second to Toncoin (TON) for the best performer in the top 10.","category":["Dogecoin","Analyst","crypto","Crypto Analyst","crypto news","Doge","DOGE news","doge price","dogecoin","Dogecoin news","dogecoin price","dogeusd","dogeusdt"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1d9","guid":"https://bitcoinist.com/?p=293962","article_link":"https://bitcoinist.com/binance-backed-gopax-exchange-makes-strides-reven/","website_source":"bitcoinist","article_title":"Binance-backed Gopax Exchange Makes Strides: Revenue Soars 97% Despite Challenges","author":"Samuel Edyme","creation_date":"2024-04-13T04:00:21Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Retail-Traders-Fuel-February-Crypto-Rally.webp?fit=509%2C339","article_summary":"A recent financial report from Streami, the parent company of Gopax, revealed that the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange experienced significant revenue growth and a notable reduction in net losses in 2023.

Gopax’s Revenue Surge And Net Loss Reduction Despite challenges related to liquidity issues and regulatory scrutiny, Gopax narrowed its net loss to 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) last year, compared to 90.6 billion won in the previous year. The financial report further showcased Gopax’s notable performance in 2023, with a roughly 97% year-over-year growth in revenue, reaching 3.1 billion won. Additionally, the exchange reduced its net operating loss by 78% to approximately 17 billion won. As reported, these positive results were largely attributed to the resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean crypto market, which emerged as one of the “most active” crypto markets globally in 2023. Despite its revenue growth, Gopax encountered notable hurdles, particularly regarding its association with Genesis Global Capital, which had a subsequent halt of withdrawals stemming from a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement in FTX in 2022. The situation resulted in substantial losses for Gopax, with funds from its GoFi-linked debt stuck in Genesis Global Capital, totaling 63.7 billion won. However, Binance, Gopax’s major shareholder, stepped in to address liquidity issues and “acquired” the exchange in February 2023, aiming to penetrate the South Korean market. According to the report, Binance’s acquisition positioned the global exchange as the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake. Binance’s Global Challenges And Resilience However, Binance itself has been navigating regulatory challenges from several corners globally. Among these challenges is the $4.3 billion fine settlement with the US Department of Justice and even the crackdown from the Nigerian government. Additionally, the crypto exchange has recently faced a ban from the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As reported, the SEC’s decision was based on Binance’s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform in the region. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino noted: The SEC has identified the aforementioned [Binance] platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing Filipinos. In response to these regulatory hurdles globally, Binance’s CEO, Richard Teng, recently outlined a new strategy focused on addressing “cultural issues” and “enhancing compliance efforts.” Notably, despite all of these challenges Binance has faced recently, the exchange’s native token, BNB, has maintained its trading value above $600, boasting green days up by 6.6% in the past 7 days and 2.2% in the past 24 hours with a current market price of $612.

NuggetRush token emerges as a promising altcoin with play-to-earn gaming features. Cardano prioritizes security and scalability for smart contracts, while Ethereum faces technical challenges but maintains its commitment to decentralization. Amidst a recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) have demonstrated signs of steadiness, as both assets have seen remarkable increases in value. At the same time, some analysts are shifting their attention to NuggetRush (NUGX), assessing its potential to become the next altcoin sensation. This digital asset offers innovative features and potential for growth in the crypto community. NuggetRush is among the bullish altcoins incorporating a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming design, allowing participants to earn tangible assets as prizes. Its innovative offerings strive to foster an engaging gaming atmosphere, attracting investors and gaming enthusiasts alike. The blockchain ICO presale is gaining momentum and piquing crypto investors’ interest. This article explores why Ethereum and Cardano show remarkable gains as analysts eye NUGX tokens as the next altcoin sensations. NuggetRush (NUGX): decentralized GameFi exploration and real-world rewards NuggetRush is a new DeFi project fostering a vibrant community within a flourishing digital ecosystem focused on GameFi exploration. Operating on the Ethereum blockchain, NuggetRush prioritizes broad user accessibility. NUGX captures attention through blending exploration, strategic thinking, and tangible real-world benefits. Analysts suggest it may be one of the bullish altcoins poised for significant gains this year. The platform presents diverse avenues for gamers to accumulate rewards, including acquiring unique character NFTs, earning RUSHGEMS, and trading in-game assets. NuggetRush differentiates itself from typical meme coins by enabling players to trade their in-game earnings outside the platform’s ecosystem. This new DeFi project has also established a player-driven marketplace for character NFTs and other exclusive items. This enriches the platform’s economy and empowers users to exchange and sell virtual assets. NuggetRush has already garnered immense support, with over 271 million tokens sold and more than $3.75 million raised. Some industry analysts are predicting that once NUGX is listed on major exchanges, its price could experience a significant surge, potentially reaching $0.020. This anticipated price increase could position NUGX as one of the best crypto investment options right now. The NuggetRush vesting system presents an appealing incentive for early adopters. Through participation in the presale phase, investors can access up to 50% of the tokens across five claim rounds based on their entry timing. This mechanism could enable early supporters to realize substantial gains as the project progresses. Cardano (ADA): scalable ecosystem for smart contracts and DApps Cardano is a decentralized platform that creates a more secure and scalable infrastructure for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Cardano is trading at approximately $0.5877, showing stability amidst market fluctuations. As the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event approaches, alternative coins like Cardano are garnering attention. ADA showcases resilience and growth potential amid market volatility. This has piqued the interest of investors and traders seeking promising alternatives within the cryptocurrency landscape. Cardano has seen a remarkable turnaround in investor sentiment. After facing outflows, there’s now a substantial $1.1 million inflow into ADA investment products. This shift highlights Cardano’s resurgence and growing appeal among crypto investors. The influx of funds indicates a renewed confidence in Cardano’s potential, marking a positive trend after a period of uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH): empowering decentralization with smart contracts Ethereum is a blockchain network that is decentralized and open-source, with the ability to execute smart contracts. The current price of Ethereum is approximately $3,315, which represents an increase of nearly 2%. After a significant upward trend from the $3,500 support level, ETH is now facing resistance around $3,550 and the 100-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA). The hourly ETH/USD chart reveals a notable resistance zone at $3,550. Technical indicators indicate that the hourly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains bullish for ETH. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits below the 50 level, suggesting potential increased selling pressure. Despite recent challenges, Ethereum’s repeated tests of crucial support levels hint at the possibility of a rapid price recovery. Conclusion As Ethereum and Cardano continue demonstrating remarkable gains in the cryptocurrency market, analysts are now setting their sights on the NuggetRush token as the next potential altcoin sensation. NuggetRush is an intriguing platform that combines gaming with decentralized finance principles. Its unique approach presents an attractive investment prospect for those interested in the growing GameFi industry. With growing excitement surrounding NUGX’s listing on major exchanges and the continued development of its ecosystem, this token’s future appears promising. It has the potential to create ripples within the ever-changing cryptocurrency world. For more information on NUGX, visit NuggetRush Presale Website.

GDA, which was founded in 2013 and operates 19 mining facilities across North America, Europe and Central Asia, has entered into a strategic hosting arrangement with Lonestar Dream, developer of immersion cooling systems for bitcoin mining devices, to run the Tarbush operation. “This hosting agreement is an important milestone for us as we continue expansion in the West Texas region,” said Andrey Kim, CEO of GDA in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. This is the 6th new site in Texas into which GDA has expanded in recent years. The state’s abundance of renewable energy and its flexible power grid have prompted the company to continue expanding in Texas. Tarbush is located within the ERCOT West Hub, which is well-suited for wind and solar energy production. As of Q1 2023, ERCOT, which stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, was the top region for renewable energy generation output across the US, according to S&P Global. And PBS recently acknowledged that Texas, a state once well known for its oil production, is quickly becoming a leader in renewable energy. According to ERCOT, renewable resources like wind and solar normally meet approximately 40% of the energy demand in Texas. During some periods, though, they can meet as much as 75% of the demand. Wind, solar, and a tiny bit of hydro met 75% of power demand in ERCOT today a little after 2:00, a new record. Add in nuclear and the Texas grid was more than 80% emissions-free for most of the afternoon. And again, prices were $0. Clean power is low cost power. #txlege #txenergy pic.twitter.com/rtbPBWnZMA — Doug Lewin (@douglewinenergy) March 29, 2024 “We believe that our commitment to renewable energy and utilization of some of the most advanced technology in the bitcoin mining industry empowers us to engage in efficient and reliable bitcoin mining operations,” Kim added.

Anza, a spinoff of Solana Labs, spearheaded the development with the release of version 1.18.11 aimed at mitigating network congestion. Validator clients, essential in proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, verify transactions to ensure compliance with network rules and confirm the sender’s fund sufficiency before appending new blocks to the blockchain. Recently, spam transactions have significantly slowed processing times and increased transaction drop rates on Solana, which uniquely processes transactions directly without a mempool, adding complexity to its congestion issues. Anza initially deployed the updated software version 1.18.11 on a devnet, and they are now calling for testnet validators to test the effectiveness of these fixes. Anza tweeted on April 12: “The v1.18.11 release is now deployed to devnet, recommended for use on testnet. Please upgrade ASAP to help us start analyzing the effects of the proposed congestion fixes.” In response to the congestion, Solana developers are also exploring strategies to enhance network efficiency. These include optimizing computing unit usage, implementing priority fees to improve user experiences, and developing a stake-weighted Quality-of-Service (QoS) system to prioritize transactions more efficiently. External analyses have highlighted the negative impact of congestion on Solana’s operational performance. The network serves as a significant hub for DeFi activities, which has escalated the congestion problem with increased demand, leading to record-high trading volumes on decentralized exchanges in March. Austin Federa, Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, recently addressed the root causes of these issues in a tweet: “The issues stem from an implementation of the QUIC protocol and can be attributed to a known issue that suddenly got much worse due to unprecedented demand.” Teams from Anza, Firedancer, Jito, and other core contributors are actively working to strengthen Solana’s networking stack in response to this demand. Federa remains optimistic about overcoming these challenges, drawing parallels to similar obstacles the network faced in early 2022. As these developments unfold, the upcoming weeks will be critical in assessing whether the implemented fixes will restore Solana’s efficiency and reliability.

JP Morgan and Bitcoin investment management firm NYDIG anticipated that spot Bitcoin ETFs could achieve an AUM of $36 billion and $30 billion by the year’s end. Meanwhile, Matrixport predicted the ETF would garner an AUM between $24 billion and $50 billion by Dec. 31, 2024. The actual AUM is nearly twice as high as each company’s earlier prediction, and spot Bitcoin ETFs are on the way to meet the more optimistic predictions made by CryptoQuant, Standard Chartered, and Bloomberg Intelligence. Bloomberg and Standard Chartered project an end-of-year AUM of roughly $100 billion for the ETFs, while CryptoQuant believes they will reach $150 billion. The data includes Grayscale’s GBTC, which accounts for $22.26 billion of the collective AUM and has mostly seen outflows since its launch. Other key ETF data Bitwise’s report also revealed that spot Bitcoin ETF demand far exceeded new BTC production during the first quarter of 2024. Miners produced 74,756 BTC during the first quarter, while the ETFs collectively took in 212,852 BTC — 2.8x higher than the amount produced. The report said that the reduction in mining output caused by Bitcoin’s upcoming halving — expected roughly around April 20 — could affect the supply-demand ratio. Bitcoin ETFs also demonstrated strong performance against the two largest US gold ETFs. During the first quarter, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $12 billion in inflows against $3 billion in gold ETF outflows. Despite their broader success, Bitcoin ETFs represent only a minority of Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin ETFs hold 800,000 BTC, amounting to 3.9% of all Bitcoin ownership. Individuals (57%), inactive accounts (17.6%), and several other small categories hold the remainder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin findings The Bitwise report also noted that Bitcoin had demonstrated high performance year-to-date, with its value rising 66.99% year-to-date — outperforming growth in almost every market, including the US equities (10.56%), gold (8.09%), DM equities (5.81%), and other markets. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan also noted “low correlations between Bitcoin and the S&P 500,” represented in the report by a 0.11 correlation between Bitcoin and the US equities market. The correlation is critical, as the degree to which Bitcoin correlates with traditional markets determines whether Bitcoin is a risk-on asset or a hedge against conventional markets. Hougan said Bitwise’s report should provoke a “staggeringly bullish” attitude toward the crypto market. He noted crypto has been in the bull market phase for the past 1.25 years and that bull markets typically last three years, meaning strong performance may persist.

It has taken the crypto market by storm and has become the hottest crypto of the week. A reason for the fast-growing attention is that BEFE coin enjoys unique features that make it exceptional compared to other meme coins, and this has kept it on the radar of investors globally. BEFE has outperformed many meme coins, even the ones with bigger popularity, because it is embedded with utilities, making it a project that gives value, unlike others waiting for a pleasant market condition. BEFE Coin, Not Your Regular Meme Coin Meme coins are characterized by using memes to gain traction in the cryptocurrency sector. Most meme coins rely on hype as utilities are not the priority, making them a bad option for long-term investments. Many investors habitually seek meme coins that can give them the profit they seek temporarily while reinvesting in some other coins that could serve as good long-term options. BEFE is rewriting the narrative as it brings excitement and utility, making investors yearn for the project offerings while maintaining the hype around it. This approach by BEFE is superb as it encourages sustainability. It breaks BEFE free from being controlled by general market conditions to being controlled by investors’ interest in offerings. This is the primary reason BEFE stands out from others. It can potentially give mouthwatering returns at every market phase as demand regularly increases. Strategic Partnerships Pushing BEFE To The Limelight The height BEFE attained results from the kind of partnership it has engaged in. Partnerships are very instrumental factors for growth. With the right partnership, all parties benefit massively, and growth is ensured. BEFE’s partnership with Bitgert is a perfect example of a symbiotic partnership where all parties benefit. Investors can get to stake and earn in return, thereby encouraging an expansion of the ecosystem for both parties. This partnership has increased demand as investors seek to make passive income easily; via this increasing demand, popularity follows suit. Conclusion With BEFE already skyrocketing and showing no signs of letting up, investors are buzzing about it and grabbing good quantities of the coin. However, research must be carried out on it for more enlightenment. To know more about BEFE, Visit https://befetoken.com Buy BEFE coin from the below exchanges now!

DOGE, with massive community backing, is an example of how hype can impact the price of a token. Some traders are already seeing it touch the $1 mark sooner than later, but that will depend on multiple factors. While we see how it goes, a new ICO, InQubeta, is competing with the likes of Chainlink and Monero. Will Dogecoin touch the $1 mark? Dogecoin has made quite the splash recently, riding the wave of meme culture straight into the hearts of a diverse crowd. It’s not just the seasoned crypto heads getting in on the action but also those looking for a fun entry point into the world of digital money. Dogecoin stands out, not so much for its tech or financial chops, but for its vibe: it’s all about community. Yet, hitting that $1 dream is tricky. Detractors often say Dogecoin’s more about hype than substance, lacking the solid foundation other top crypto coins have. But DOGE believers see a different picture: its acceptance by more and more merchants and its die-hard community could mean Dogecoin’s joke could have the last laugh, making it a serious player in the crypto game. As Dogecoin starts popping up more in everyday transactions and online shops start accepting it, it’s beginning to shake off its meme coin image, hinting that its cultural clout could indeed cement its place in the crypto world with real, lasting value. InQubeta: A new vanguard in AI crypto investment While Dogecoin captures headlines with its rollercoaster market antics, a new name, InQubeta, is quietly turning heads among savvy investors. Positioned as a serious rival to crypto veterans like Monero and Chainlink, InQubeta stands out by weaving the untapped potential of AI into the fabric of crypto investments. InQubeta is on a mission to simplify access to the once-gated world of AI startups, offering a golden ticket to the average investor through its innovative QUBE tokens. This platform is changing the game by allowing anyone to grab a piece of the AI pie, previously a feast for the Silicon Valley bigwigs only. By making fractional investment a thing of reality, InQubeta is breaking open the door that has always kept retail on the sidelines. The real kicker? InQubeta utilizes NFTs to offer shares in these AI companies, making investment outcomes transparent and directly related to their success. This not only enriches the investment landscape but also weaves a closer bond between investors and the tech pioneers driving these projects. InQubeta’s vision doesn’t stop there. With a roadmap that dreams big – launching an NFT marketplace, rolling out the InQubeta swap, and firing up a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – it’s clear they’re leading the march towards a future where AI and blockchain not just meet but meld in exciting ways. Backed by a thorough audit and a presale buzz that’s already drawing in the millions, InQubeta’s journey towards cross-chain expansion in 2024 is not just promising; it’s practically in motion. Conclusion As Dogecoin dances its way towards the coveted $1 mark, fueled by a lively community and its irresistible meme magic, InQubeta is carving out its own place in the crypto world with something totally different.

PEPE Symmetrical Triangle May Hint At The Next Move For The Memecoin In a new article on X, analyst Ali discussed the recent trend forming in the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the memecoin is currently forming a symmetrical triangle pattern on its one-day chart. The “symmetrical triangle” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle. In this pattern, there are two lines of interest between which the asset’s price consolidates for a period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back Above $70,000 Despite Negative Taker Volume The upper line connects successive tops, while the lower one joins together bottoms. The main feature of the pattern is that these two lines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope (hence the “symmetrical” in the name). There are other triangle patterns in TA, but those have either differently angled lines (as is the case with wedges) or one line parallel to the time-axis (ascending and descending triangles). Like other TA patterns that represent a consolidation phase, the lines of the symmetrical triangle also serve as a point of potential reversal for the price. The upper line usually offers resistance (meaning tops can occur), while the lower line may provide support (bottom formation). When a break takes place from either of these lines, the price may likely see sustained momentum in that direction. This implies that a break above the triangle could be a bullish signal, while one below may be bearish. The symmetrical triangle may be viewed as a phase of the market in which the bulls and bears are at a standstill, hence why the price is ranging sideways. During a break, one of these wins out, and price action follows in that direction. Naturally, as the lines converge towards a center point in this pattern, a breakout becomes increasingly probable the closer to the apex of the triangle the asset’s price gets. Now, here is the chart shared by Ali that highlights the symmetrical triangle pattern that PEPE has been trading inside recently: Looks like the asset's price is getting closer to the converging point of the pattern | Source: @ali_charts on X As is visible in the graph, the 1-day price of PEPE has been approaching the triangle’s apex recently, implying that a break in a direction may be coming for the memecoin.

Bitcoin’s Price Surge Might Not Come Immediately Phung mentioned during an interview with BeInCrypto that Bitcoin’s price tends to increase around 6 to 12 months after the Halving and not immediately. This is evident from the past Halving events, as Bitcoin’s significant price gains came about one year after the Halving had occurred. After the first Halving on November 28, 2021, Bitcoin saw a price increase of over 8,000% one year after the event.

Phung further noted that Bitcoin’s price gains come from the reduction in Bitcoin miners’ supply, which helps increase scarcity and drive up its price, especially when demand is stable. In February, NewsBTC reported that Bitcoin’s demand was far outpacing the miners’ supply. This led to several crypto analysts making bullish predictions that Bitcoin’s price could increase exponentially when miners’ rewards are further cut in half later this month. One such analyst was MacronautBTC, who raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to $237,000. This Bitcoin Halving Could Be Different Despite the crypto market being known to follow historical patterns, Phung emphasized that the market can also be unpredictable, opening the possibility of this Halving being different from past ones. Moreover, this cycle has already proven different, considering that for the first time, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Halving. Furthermore, the analyst acknowledged that the Bitcoin market is “much larger and more established compared to earlier halvings.” However, Phung still expects a price increase after the halving, although she admitted that the exact timing is uncertain, meaning it could be earlier or even later than usual. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also echoed a similar sentiment about how things could be different this cycle when he shared his analysis of the five phases of the Bitcoin Halving. Specifically, he stated that the Re-accumulation phase “may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation” since this is the first time the Re-accumulation range will be around a new ATH. Market Sentiment Could Determine Bitcoin’s Price Post-Halving Phung also elaborated on how the market sentiment after the halving could provide insights into Bitcoin’s future trajectory.

The post Crypto Whales Sold Holdings Before the Market Crash appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"In the last 24 hours, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and altcoins encountered significant volatility, resulting in a notable decline, with the overall crypto market capitalization dropping by approximately 8%, settling at $2.53 trillion. This swift market fluctuation may have taken many retail traders by surprise. However, insights from on-chain data reveal that certain large-scale investors, colloquially known as crypto whales, foresaw the downturn and offloaded a substantial portion of their holdings. Crypto Whales Offload Holdings On-chain analysts reported that several institutional investors strategically sold portions of their holdings during the market downturn. Four crypto whales collectively offloaded 31,683 ETH, valued at approximately $106 million. Among the identified crypto whales were notable entities such as Cumberland, an address linked to the bankrupt Alameda/FTX estate, and two undisclosed altcoin wallets. Cumberland, a prominent institutional crypto investment firm, deposited 17,206 ETH, amounting to $57.3 million, across various exchanges. On the other hand, two crypto whales, ‘0xC3f8’ and ‘0x1717’, moved 7,976 ETH worth $26.6 million and 4,000 ETH worth $13.32 million, respectively, to Binance and other exchanges. Similarly, the FTX/Alameda estate transferred 2,500 ETH, valued at around $8.33 million. Interestingly, this is not the first time the failed exchange has effectively been able to time the market before drastic sell-offs. “Since March 1, FTX and Alameda have deposited 15,850 ETH, worth $58 million into centralized exchanges at roughly $3,659, and dramatic price changes tended to follow afterward,” blockchain firm SpotOnChain said. FTX Crypto Sales. Source: SpotOnChain These significant trading activities exerted additional selling pressure on the market, contributing to the downturn. During the reporting period, Ethereum’s price dropped by 13%. It went from $3,500 to reach as low as $3,062 for the first time in nearly a month.

Although the leading cryptocurrency has slightly rebounded to around $68,000 at press time, its volatility led to a decrease in market capitalization to $1.3 trillion. According to data from CompaniesMarketCap, this positions Bitcoin behind Meta, the parent company of Facebook, in the global ranking of top assets. Regardless, computer scientist Edward Snowden ridiculed the industry’s reaction to the recent dip, noting that the price of Bitcoin had remained relatively stable during the week. “[I] see crypto people freaking out over prices [then I] open bitcoin chart [and see that the] price is the same as it was seven days ago,” Snowden remarked.

The post Former Amazon Engineer Sentenced for Hacking DeFi Protocols appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"In a landmark legal action, former Amazon engineer Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to three years in prison for orchestrating hacks on two DeFi cryptocurrency exchanges, resulting in over $12 million theft. US District Judge Victor Marrero handed down the sentence, marking a significant milestone in crypto-related law enforcement. DeFi Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison Shakeeb Ahmed utilized his extensive knowledge in reverse engineering and blockchain audits to manipulate smart contracts on the exchanges. US Attorney Damian Williams states this case represents the first-ever conviction for hacking a smart contract. “No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks,” Williams emphasized. On July 2 and 3, 2022, Ahmed targeted the first exchange by injecting fake pricing data, generating $9 million in inflated fees, which he then illicitly withdrew. In a subsequent communication with the exchange, Ahmed agreed to return the stolen funds except for $1.5 million, provided the exchange did not report the attack to law enforcement. A few weeks later, on July 28, Ahmed exploited a vulnerability in Nirvana Finance’s smart contracts. This second attack drained Nirvana of approximately $3.6 million, nearly all its funds, forcing the platform to shut down. Ahmed declined Nirvana’s substantial bug bounty offer, opting to keep the stolen assets. Read more: Identifying & Exploring Risk on DeFi Lending Protocols Ahmed engaged in sophisticated laundering techniques to obscure the origins of the stolen funds. These included swapping tokens across blockchains, converting assets into the untraceable crypto Monero, and utilizing overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers. In addition to prison time, the court has ordered Ahmed to forfeit around $12.3 million in stolen assets. He must also pay restitution exceeding $5 million to the affected exchanges. He will also undergo three years of supervised release post-incarceration.

The training, done as part of the firm’s Corporate Social Responsibility is to help bolster law enforcement’s understanding of blockchain technology, particularly as Hong Kong continues its push as the new darling of the crypto economy. According to a local media source, the training sessions were conducted for the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) and Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB). Web3 Companies and Authorities Jointly Fight Crypto Crimes With the increasing prominence of Hong Kong in the cryptocurrency space, Bitrace CEO Isabel says it is necessary to strengthen collaboration between Web3 companies and the authorities. She maintains that the training is targeted at equipping law enforcement officers with the necessary skills and knowledge to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes effectively. Isabel, while delivering a comprehensive overview of crypto-assets application in cybercrime, highlighted some challenges including the fact that regulatory agencies lag behind in understanding crypto-criminal methods. Many crypto crime fighters do not also know that encrypted crime investigation is usually multi-layered, and the low efficiency of collaboration among stakeholders. The Bitrace CEO insisted that it is necessary to protect the security of users’ funds and foster a healthier and safer Web3 environment by strengthening partnerships with regulatory agencies. The capacity-building sessions delved into various aspects of crypto-related crimes such as online gambling, illicit asset trading, money laundering, and fraud. Last year, Anatoly Legkodymov, the former CEO of Bitzlato, pleaded guilty to facilitating the laundering of illicit funds totaling $700 million. Using the BitracePro crypto asset tracking and analysis platform, Bitrace’s technical experts demonstrated how crypto funds are utilized and circulated in criminal activities. Real-life case studies were analyzed to provide insights into encryption crime methods and the flow of criminal funds on the blockchain. Bitrace Capabilities Beyond Hong Kong Police Training Besides the training, Bitrace also engaged in discussions with the Commercial Crimes Bureau and the Cyber Crime Bureau. The aim is to foster collaboration between regulatory agencies and Web3 companies. Prior to the training, the regulatory authorities have tried to keep the space sane. For instance, last month, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong had flagged suspected crypto fraud with HKCEXP to prevent users from falling victim to scams. Analysts say Bitrace is well suited to provide capacity building for Hong Kong police as it has advanced analytics capabilities, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms and has enabled the accumulation of a vast address tag library. This library includes entity tags such as DeFi platforms, mining pools, and digital asset exchanges, as well as risk behavior tags like fraud, money laundering, and illegal online gambling. Thus, by utilizing this technology, regulatory authorities can swiftly identify suspicious addresses and mitigate potential risks associated with crypto transactions. Industry watchers hope that the collaboration addresses the challenges posed by crypto-related crimes. This is paramount as the Hong Kong SFC is set to green light spot Bitcoin ETFs in the region anything from now.next Bitrace Empowers Hong Kong Police with On-Chain Crypto Funds Tracking Training","category":["Altcoin News","Cryptocurrency News","News","Bitrace"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e231","guid":"https://www.coinspeaker.com/?p=295751","article_link":"https://www.coinspeaker.com/mempool-developer-bitcoin-layer-2-solutions/","website_source":"feeds.feedburner","article_title":"Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users","author":"Temitope Olatunji","creation_date":"2024-04-11T19:47:20Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"Coinspeaker Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users The developer of Mempool Mononaut has expressed concerns about various BTC L2 solutions.

In the bid to propose solutions, Layer 2 (L2) technologies have emerged, offering the potential to ease the strain on the base layer and unlock new possibilities for the digital asset. However, the path to scalability has sparked a divisive debate within the crypto community, with supporters expressing their concerns about the advantages and potential risks of various L2 implementations. If your Bitcoin L2 doesn't support unilateral exit, that's not your L2 that's a multisig. pic.twitter.com/Ors4ZvpmjX — mononaut (tx/acc) (@mononautical) April 10, 2024 A notable critic is the developer of Mempool, Mononaut, who has expressed their concerns about various BTC L2 solutions. Their critique covers a range of factors, including the involvement of venture capital (VC) investors and the issuance of separate tokens, as well as the centralized or federated structures that underpin some of these initiatives. The developer’s concerns also extend to projects that offer reciprocal rewards based on user deposits, which they liken to pyramid schemes, and those that incentivize long-term lockups of coins, drawing comparisons to offerings like Hex. Additionally, he was skeptical of L2 platforms that lack comprehensive technical documentation, dismissing them as mere copies of the infamous Bitconnect scheme with a superficial disguise. In a post on X, they said: “If your Bitcoin L2 has no whitepaper or technical details, only 20 pages of documentation on how to deposit BTC and calculate your future yield, that’s not your L2 that’s Bitconnect wearing a false moustache.” Echoing these concerns is Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA), who has openly questioned the effectiveness of Bitcoin’s L2 solutions compared to the scaling approaches adopted by Ethereum and Cardano. Hoskinson argues that BTC’s inherent design limitations make it incredibly challenging to implement additional functionality, often requiring the deployment of centralized or federated infrastructures – a compromise that, in his opinion, undermines the fundamental principles of the coin. The Optimist’s Perspective: Envisioning Bitcoin’s L2-Driven Future However, not all voices in the cryptosphere share this skepticism. Proponents of L2 technologies, like Yago, an X user with over twenty thousand followers, remain steadfast in his belief that these solutions will propel BTC to new heights, making it a cornerstone of modern civilization. He envisions a future where BTC becomes intertwined with various aspects of our lives, driven by the asset’s increasing value as L2 implementations unlock new use cases and efficiencies. It is evident that both sides of the argument present strong and convincing opinions, stating the challenge of promoting new ideas while remaining true to the coin’s commitment to decentralization, which has been the foundation of its success. The Layer 2 solutions offer the potential for the future of BTC by creating opportunities as the Bitcoin community continues to grow and generate innovative ideas. In recent times, we have witnessed a series of developments that have transformed the crypto space, such as AI-enhanced gaming in the crypto space and improved digital wallets that provide enhanced security, user-friendly interfaces, and additional features for managing digital assets. Nevertheless, the full impact of these changes is still unknown due to their rapid pace of occurrence.next Mempool Developer Criticizes Many Bitcoin Layer 2 Solutions, Claims They Are Created to Defraud Users","category":["Bitcoin News","Cryptocurrency News","News","ada","bitcoin","btc","cardano","mempool","mononaut"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e23f","guid":"https://coinjournal.net/?p=198555","article_link":"https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-ceo-believes-crypto-market-could-reach-5-trillion-by-year-end-here-are-top-3-picks-that-might-help-position-you-for-gains/","website_source":"coinjournal.net","article_title":"Ripple CEO believes crypto market could reach $5 trillion by year end – Here are top 3 picks that might help position you for gains","author":"News Team","creation_date":"2024-04-13T23:00:49Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"Ripple CEO is claiming the crypto market could reach $5 trillion by the end of 2024.

Investors are looking for better opportunities to invest and gain lucrative profits if that happens. According to some analysts, Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the best altcoins to include in investment portfolios. Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, is bullish on the crypto market, predicting that the crypto market cap could double and reach around $5 trillion by the end of 2024. Garlinghouse believes spot ETF approval and the Bitcoin halving event will fuel this prediction. But he also emphasized the crucial impact of favorable U.S. regulatory changes on the crypto market’s growth. The crypto community is understandably excited about this market prediction, with investors and analysts digging into the numbers to determine which tokens could be the best bets to capitalize on this growth. A growing number of experts believe SOL, SUI and $ROE could be some of the top crypto coins to consider adding to your portfolio ahead of this market expansion. Let’s take a look at their reasoning. Solana validators approve ‘Timely Vote Credits’ Solana validators have agreed on a “Timely Vote Credits” plan, which speeds up transactions. It does so by modifying the consensus vote latency. The proposal was passed on April 8 with 98% votes. Besides, SOL was trading around $172 in the second week of April with minor fluctuations. Experts say it is near the crucial support level of $170. If it breaks down from here then, SOL might trade around $160 by mid-2024. However, if SOL manages to stay above $172, then it could head towards $190 and eventually to $200. If the bullish momentum persists then SOL could trade around $250 by the end of 2024. Is SUI ready to take off? SUI has risen by 290% in the past year, from a low of $0.37 in October to its current price of $1.46. In mid-April, Sui was trading around $1.57 with the crypto market cap of $2 billion. SUI has been fluctuating between $1.35 and $2.15 in the past month. Experts say SUI is in a downtrend now, with the support at $1.55. If it breaks below this support zone, then SUI could trade around $1.30 by mid-2024. Still, many analysts are optimistic about SUI’s growth potential, with some indicating that if it breaks above the resistance level of $1.70, then it will move towards $1.80. By the end of 2024, SUI has the potential to trade around $2.50, according to a number of forecasts. Borroe Finance presale is on fire Borroe Finance is attracting investors in its final stage of the presale. They raised over $3.66 million by selling over 282 million $ROE tokens. In Stage 5, $ROE is priced at $0.02 per token, and it will be listed at a price of $0.025 across several exchanges. This will generate 25% profit for new investors. In addition, current investors are also enjoying a 15% bonus when they use a promo code (“WELCOME”), but data suggests there are now only 153 million $ROE tokens left to be sold. Borroe Finance aims to revolutionize Web3 business funding through blockchain, AI-powered risk assessments, and smart contracts. It offers quicker access to capital by allowing businesses to mint and sell NFTs. These NFTs represent their future revenue. $ROE utilizes the Polygon blockchain for its efficiency and low fees. The team is experienced and always brings their best to the table. Some crypto analysts are predicting that Borroe Finance could be the best blockchain ICO in the market right now, which is why many investors are deciding to HODL $ROE tokens.

The post Solana Dips Below $140 Amid Network Congestion Fixes appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"Solana developers have issued an urgent update to tackle the blockchain network’s ongoing congestion challenges. Anza, a prominent infrastructure developer, successfully deployed version 1.18.11 as a congestion fix to the Solana devnet and invited validators to test its efficacy. Network Fixes Target Congestion The Solana-focused software development firm urged all testnet validators to upgrade their systems promptly to facilitate a thorough analysis of the impact of the proposed solution. Over the past weeks, Solana has grappled with elevated transaction failure rates, exacerbated by an influx of bots exploiting meme coin activity. As a result, several Solana-based protocols were forced to postpone their launch due to network congestion. Notably, there are indications that the situation might be improving. Phantom, the foremost wallet provider on Solana, revealed that its transaction success rates have significantly improved. “For the past 24 hours, our metrics show that transactions have been landing nearly 90% of the time, almost a 5x improvement from a week ago. Sending and swapping in Phantom should be much more reliable now. If you are still having issues, retrying should be a quick fix,” Phantom said. Meanwhile, Jacob Creech, the head of developer relations at the Solana Foundation, praised the network’s response to the congestion issues. “In the 2022 network congestion, core engineers were the main contributors to fixing the problem. Now we have core engineers, dapps, validators, RPCs, developers, and more laser-focused on improving UX. Solana’s developer community is maturing. We will get past this and be even better for it,” Creech stated. Despite improving the network’s transaction situation, Solana experienced a 12% decline during the past day. This pushed its price below $140 for the first time in a month. However, the decline mirrored a broader market downturn that prompted over $860 million in crypto liquidations across major assets, including Bitcoin. This price movement marks a shock occurrence for Solana. SOL’s price has been on an uptrend, rising by around 50% year-to-date. But, it has considerably struggled since peaking at above $200 in mid-March, declining by more than 13% during the past week, according to BeInCrypto data.

If that fix is working Monday, I can see us pump straight back to $200. If not, we’ll probably see more negative price action and possibly a fall to $120-130 ranges,” Crypto trader Thor wrote.

With a very low likelihood of receiving approval, despite much attention being directed at the surging price of Bitcoins, Ethereum enthusiasts are anxiously waiting to know what the future holds for their preferred digital asset. While interest in an Ethereum ETF is declining, investors are looking for alternative ways to diversify their investment portfolios. One such project gaining traction involves ALGT, a native token of Algotech, a decentralized algorithmic trading platform. Offering the promise of advanced technologies and automation, this presents a lucrative opening for investors who want more than traditional cryptocurrencies. Analyzing Ethereum Price Amidst Halving Speculation With Bitcoin halving around the corner, many crypto enthusiasts wonder about Ethereum’s future after this event. Unlike Bitcoin’s halving, which has historically resulted in a price boost, it is hard to predict whether the same will happen to Ethereum. Currently, ETH is trading at $3,503.32 with a 5% drop over the last 24 hours, but ETH experienced a 6% rebound from its March 29th lows, following Bitcoin’s (BTC) 5.8% bounce. Despite these gains, bullish momentum remained subdued, urging caution for long traders. Technical indicators suggested increasing selling pressure and bearish short-term sentiment, even as exchange reserves dwindled, indicating accumulation. Overvaluation seemed unlikely due to the neutral position of RSI at around 50 and undervaluation according to the 30-day MVRV ratio, which implied a lack of any other wave for selling. Nevertheless, decreased Daily Active Addresses and a declining Social Dominance chart indicate weakening social engagement and persistent sales pressure that implies possible further losses despite the increase in Open Interest. Ethereum ETF Approval Doubts Grow Amidst SEC’s Silence As Bitcoin approaches its halving event, there is speculation that the United States will not approve Ethereum ETFs. Indications show that regulatory hurdles may block the launching of such investment products despite investor enthusiasm. With the SEC exhibiting its unwillingness to consider and comment on Ethereum ETF filings, optimism is no longer there. SEC’s May deadline could disappoint issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, which anticipate approval for Ethereum ETFs. Further complicating matters is the regulatory uncertainty surrounding how Ethereum should be classified, making the regulatory environment difficult for ETF issuers to navigate. Investors Flock to ALGT Token, Ongoing Presale Raised $3.7M Against the backdrop of regulatory uncertainty and ETF rejections, investors are turning to Algotech native token ALGT (ERC-20 tokens) as a viable alternative. The ongoing presale of ALGT has garnered significant attention, with the project’s ongoing presale raising over $3.7 million. The platform’s cutting-edge technology and commitment to empowering traders through intelligent trading strategies are resonating with investors seeking innovative solutions. Algotech offers a broad scope of algorithmic strategies designed to optimize client success and provide transparency and scalability. It strives to limit possible losses and improve trading performance within changing financial markets by having a solid technical infrastructure and sophisticated risk management techniques. Moreover, because of its decentralized nature, it ensures that its users enjoy safe and reliable trade. Conclusion Bitcoin’s upcoming halving is a chance for investors to take advantage of both sides of the cryptocurrency market divide. Even though it is still possible that Ethereum prices could rise sharply, some regulatory obstacles seem to put question marks on its future potential in terms of ETF approvals. However, investors are seeking alternative options like Algotech’s ALGT ERC-20 tokens to sieve through the ever-changing financial world.

Investors are looking for better opportunities to invest and gain lucrative profits if that happens. According to some analysts, Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the best altcoins to include in investment portfolios. Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, is bullish on the crypto market, predicting that the crypto market cap could double and reach around $5 trillion by the end of 2024. Garlinghouse believes spot ETF approval and the Bitcoin halving event will fuel this prediction. But he also emphasized the crucial impact of favourable U.S. regulatory changes on the crypto market’s growth. The crypto community is understandably excited about this market prediction, with investors and analysts digging into the numbers to determine which tokens could be the best bets to capitalize on this growth. Many experts believe SOL, SUI and Borroe Finance ($ROE) could be some of the top crypto coins to consider adding to your portfolio ahead of this market expansion. Let’s take a look at their reasoning. Solana validators approve ‘Timely Vote Credits’ Solana validators have agreed on a “Timely Vote Credits” plan, which speeds up transactions. It does so by modifying the consensus vote latency. The proposal was passed on April 8 with 98% votes. Besides, SOL was trading around $172 in the second week of April with minor fluctuations. Experts say it is near the crucial support level of $170. If it breaks down from here then, SOL might trade around $160 by mid-2024. However, if Solana (SOL) price manages to stay above $172, then it could head towards $190 and eventually to $200. If the bullish momentum persists then SOL could trade around $250 by the end of 2024. Is SUI ready to take off? SUI has risen by 290% in the past year, from a low of $0.37 in October to its current price of $1.46. In mid-April, Sui was trading around $1.57 with the crypto market cap of $2 billion. SUI has been fluctuating between $1.35 and $2.15 in the past month. Experts say SUI is in a downtrend now, with the support at $1.55. If it breaks below this support zone, then SUI could trade around $1.30 by mid-2024. Still, many analysts are optimistic about SUI’s growth potential, with some indicating that if it breaks above the resistance level of $1.70, then it will move towards $1.80. By the end of 2024, SUI has the potential to trade around $2.50, according to a number of forecasts. Borroe Finance presale on fire Borroe Finance is attracting investors in its final stage of the presale. They raised over $3.66 million by selling over 282 million $ROE tokens. In Stage 5, $ROE is priced at $0.02 per token, and it will be listed at a price of $0.025 across several exchanges. This will generate 25% profit for new investors. In addition, current investors are also enjoying a 15% bonus when they use a promo code (“WELCOME”), but data suggests there are now only 153 million $ROE tokens left to be sold. Borroe Finance aims to revolutionize Web3 business funding through blockchain, AI-powered risk assessments, and smart contracts. It offers quicker access to capital by allowing businesses to mint and sell NFTs. These NFTs represent their future revenue. ROE utilizes the Polygon blockchain for its efficiency and low fees. The team is experienced and always brings their best to the table. Some crypto analysts are predicting that Borroe Finance could be one of the best blockchain ICOs in the market today, which is why many investors are to HODLing $ROE tokens.

The presale of Rebel Satoshi’s new token, $RECQ, has been growing at a significant rate. This growth has occurred even as many top crypto coins, such as Injective (INJ) and Terra Classic (LUNC), have been struggling. Let’s delve into why $RECQ has left the top altcoins like INJ and LUNC behind, and why several analysts are describing it as the best crypto to buy right now. Rebel Satoshi nears 75% completion of stage 1 of the $RECQ presale The innovative meme coin project Rebel Satoshi is built on the Ethereum network. Inspired by Guy Fawkes and Satoshi Nakamoto, Rebel Satoshi aims to bring a community-driven revolution. Rebel Satoshi aims to challenge the centralized financial institutions and take back control from the elites. The Rebel Satoshi ecosystem includes an NFT Vault, staking pools, a merchandise store, and a gaming Arcade. The entire Rebel Satoshi ecosystem is built on its dual-token system of the $RBLZ and the $RECQ tokens. Rebel Satoshi aims to grow to a $100 million market cap. Also, the presale of the $RBLZ token generated 150% returns and raised over $2.5 million for its investors. Right now, Rebel Satoshi is conducting the presale of the $RECQ tokens at $0.0037 per token in Stage 1. The $RECQ token has rallied by 85% to reach the current price, and over 74% of tokens have already been sold out. By the end of the presale, the $RECQ token is forecast to surge by 238% to $0.0125. That’s why some analysts are describing the $RECQ token as one of the best cryptos to buy right now. Injective continues to trade in red after rising to an all-time high The Injective (INJ) token has been one of the best performers in the recent market surge. As a result, the Injective price rose to an all-time high of $52.75 on March 13. Since then, the INJ token has been on a downtrend. As of the second week of April, the INJ price dropped by 34.6% to trade at around $34.45. Amid the price drop, the Injective (INJ) ecosystem has continued to grow exponentially. For instance, the Ionic Upgrade to the Injective Bridge was announced on March 26. The first DePin platform on Injective (INJ), Aurora, was introduced on April 7. These developments and others in the Injective ecosystem have led to a bullish outlook. Experts predict that the INJ token could rise above $40 again in the coming months. Terra Classic trades sideways after getting caught in market volatility The Terra Classic (LUNC) token has been caught up in volatility ever since rising in March. Initially, the LUNC token price dropped to $0.000121 on March 19 before bouncing slightly. The Terra Classic price then rose by 41.3% to $0.000171 a week later before dipping again. Since then, the Terra Classic (LUNC) has entered a downtrend, dipping by 20.4% to around the $0.000136 level. This drop in LUNC price has occurred despite Binance burning 4.1 billion LUNC on April 2. As the massive token burn has failed to turn the Terra Classic token bullish, experts are increasingly bearish on it. Hence, many are predicting that the Terra Classic (LUNC) will drop below $0.000120 in the coming months.

This integration is set to enable Coinbase customers to conduct instant and cost-effective bitcoin transactions. Thrilled to announce that @Coinbase has selected @Lightspark to enable the #Bitcoin Lightning Network across its platform and services. Yet another significant milestone for Lightning! ⚡to many millions of new people and 100+ countries coming soon! https://t.co/Dj5JDqdmOl — David Marcus (@davidmarcus) April 3, 2024 “Coinbase is committed to making the global financial system faster and more efficient,” said Shan Aggarwal, VP of Corporate & Business Development. “We’re excited to partner with Lightspark to eliminate payment barriers and enable faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions through support for the Bitcoin Lightning Network.” Lightspark has dedicated nearly two years to developing its platform as a premier entry point to the Lightning Network, catering to the needs of institutional clients seeking reliable and efficient solutions for Bitcoin transactions. The integration with Coinbase includes Lightspark's sophisticated tools and services, such as SDKs, APIs, and developer tools, which simplify the process of implementing and managing Lightning nodes. One key aspect of the integration is Lightspark's remote-key signing implementation, where Coinbase holds the Lightning signing keys while Lightspark hosts the Lightning node. This setup aims to ensure scalability, reliability, and optimization of node infrastructure, allowing Coinbase to focus on delivering exceptional user experiences without the complexities of managing a large-scale Lightning implementation. \"It was a pleasure to get to know David and the entire team at Lightspark,\" said Coinbase Protocol Specialist, Viktor Bunin. \"They've built great tech, are great to work with, and we're excited to partner with them to launch Lightning support soon™.\" Todays official announcement comes almost a full year after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong committed to integrating the Lightning Network onto the exchange. The integration is now coming at a crucial time, considering the increasing demand for efficient Bitcoin transactions amid rising Bitcoin prices and transaction fees. Coinbase facilitates a major $154 billion in quarterly volume traded across its platform, and will now give its customers access to cheap and efficient Bitcoin transactions to help further improve scalability.","category":["News","Lightspark","Lightning network","Coinbase","Business","Bitcoin"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1d5","guid":"https://bitcoinist.com/?p=293961","article_link":"https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-belief-62-5-of-all-ltc-investors-hodlers/","website_source":"bitcoinist","article_title":"Litecoin Belief: 62.5% Of All LTC Investors Are HODLers","author":"Keshav Verma","creation_date":"2024-04-13T09:00:01Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/michael-fortsch-fYSVVQqiqPs-unsplash.jpg?fit=630%2C420","article_summary":"On-chain data shows that Litecoin’s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all LTC investors now qualify as these HODLers.

There Are Now More Than Five Million Litecoin Long-Term Holders According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the LTC network recently reached a new milestone in terms of its long-term holder count. The “long-term holders” (LTHs) here refer to Bitcoin investors who have held their coins for more than a year without moving or selling them. Note that IntoTheBlock chose this cutoff; other analytics firms have an LTH threshold between 5 and 6 months. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for relatively long periods, are considered to carry a strong resolve. Historically, the LTHs rarely show selling activity, regardless of whatever happens in the rest of the market. The fickle-minded part of the sector that holds for relatively low timespans is called the short-term holder (STH) group. Participating STHs in selloffs isn’t uncommon; it happens whenever significant volatility emerges, whether in the form of a rally or crash. On the other hand, it can be a notable event when the LTHs sell. One way to track the behavior of the LTHs is through the total number of addresses that qualify for the cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that reveals the trend in this metric for Litecoin since the start of the year. As displayed in the above graph, the number of Litecoin LTH addresses has grown significantly over the last few months and has now reached the 5 million mark. This means that more than five million LTC wallets haven’t made any move since at least a year ago. This corresponds to 62.5% of all addresses on the blockchain currently carrying some non-zero balance. This is a significant amount and suggests that most of the holder base has been interested in HODLing the cryptocurrency. Naturally, supply staying locked in the wallets of these diamond hands can be bullish due to how supply-demand dynamics tend to play out. Remember that any increases in the LTH addresses don’t imply that HODLers are currently buying Litecoin. Rather, it suggests that some investors acquired coins a year ago, and they have only now been able to qualify for the group.

South Korea’s Opposition Party Wins Parliamentary Vote, What It Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker South Korea’s Opposition Party Wins Parliamentary Vote, What It Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets South Korea’s liberal opposition party, Democratic Party (DPK), has won a landslide majority in the parliamentary. While the outcome did not guarantee an outright ouster of the current sitting president, Yoon Suk Yeol, all indicators point to a one-term tenure ending in three years. Furthermore, the opposition’s landslide victory has led to the resignation of Han Dong-hoon and Han Duck-soo as the party leader of the People Power Party (PPP) and Prime Minister respectively. Notably, South Korea’s opposition parties jointly won 192 out of the 300 seats in the National Assembly. If the opposition parties managed to reach 200 seats, the current president would be impeached. Nonetheless, the remaining three years for the current president will be extremely difficult with the opposition controlling the National Assembly. What South Korea’s Opposition Win Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Assets South Korea is one of the leading developed countries that have significantly adopted the web3 industry and digital assets. The high adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets in South Korea, amounting to over 6 million people, had a significant influence in the just concluded parliamentary election. Furthermore, both sides of the political aisle had promised reward packages for the cryptocurrency industry if elected in the country’s National Assembly. On one side, the PPP had vowed to delay a digital asset tax and allow investors to thrive in the nascent sector. On the other hand, the Democratic Party pledged to allow South Korean investors to tap into spot Bitcoin ETFs both locally and overseas. JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea's pro-#Bitcoin Democratic Party has won the national election to form government. DP: \"We're going to allow the ETFs, domestic or overseas.\" More than 6 million South Koreans — over 10% of the population own Bitcoin or crypto. — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) April 11, 2024 Notably, the DP party will need to overhaul the country’s securities regulator that previously indicated that brokering spot BTC ETFs violates the law. The arguments follow data that shows that South Korean investors purchased more than $200 million of MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR). Additionally, more investors from South Korea have been trading crypto futures ETFs. Meanwhile, it will remain a game of waiting to see if the president will bend to the National Assembly’s rules and vice versa. Market Picture The cryptocurrency market remains in a macro bullish outlook with the Bitcoin halving 2024 about 9 days from happening. The fact that the United States has struggled to tame the dollar inflation is a direct reflection of the global economic situation. Furthermore, some countries led by El Salvador have been purchasing Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and global geopolitical instability. As Coinspeaker previously noted, the United States Federal Reserve only remains optimistic that interest rate cuts will take place later this year amid the upcoming general elections. Meanwhile, Bitcoin price is attempting to rally beyond the resistance range between $71k and $72k.next South Korea’s Opposition Party Wins Parliamentary Vote, What It Means for Bitcoin and Crypto Markets","category":["Altcoin News","Cryptocurrency News","News","bitcoin","btc","microstrategy"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e23a","guid":"https://themerkle.com/?p=80489","article_link":"https://themerkle.com/the-bitgert-coin-boom-exploring-the-escalating-demand-phenomenon/","website_source":"themerkle","article_title":"The Bitgert Coin Boom: Exploring the Escalating Demand Phenomenon","author":"Null Transaction PR","creation_date":"2024-04-11T21:18:05Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"The cryptocurrency ecosystem has made advancements over the years and is no longer on the same level it was when the first Bitcoin was created.

However, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a conspicuous silence on the matter, speculation has risen on the likelihood of the approval. This speculation is further fuelled by the scarcity of concrete details regarding the approval process, leaving investors and enthusiasts worried and anticipating. Bitcoin Maxi Weighs In Ethereum Spot ETF Approval In the spot Ethereum ETF debate, notable voices from the cryptocurrency space have offered their perspectives. Renowned Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to the president of El Salvador, Max Keiser, has recently expressed skepticism regarding the SEC’s cautious approach to approving an Ethereum ETF. Keiser, known for his staunch advocacy of Bitcoin and skepticism towards alternative cryptocurrencies, dismissed Ethereum as a “proof-of-stake scam,” suggesting it lacks the regulatory backing necessary for SEC approval. The SEC is right not to approve an Ethereum (ETH) ETF It’s a proof-of-stake scam that fails on all requirements the SEC would look for. https://t.co/nLz8boTGtW — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) April 11, 2024 Keiser’s sentiment echoes that of Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, who also recently shared a conservative outlook on the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving regulatory approval. Balchunas estimated the chances of approval at a mere 25%, further fueling uncertainty surrounding the prospect of an Ethereum ETF. Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain’t looking good. https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) March 25, 2024 Additionally, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck expressed anticipation of a potential rejection of their Ethereum ETF application, citing prolonged regulatory reviews and lack of clarity from the SEC. Spot ETH ETF Gains Regulatory Interest Overseas Amidst the uncertainty surrounding the US SEC’s stance on Ethereum ETFs, reports suggest a contrasting regulatory environment in Hong Kong. According to Bloomberg, Hong Kong regulators may soon approve exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a potential shift in global regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrency investment products. If approved, these ETFs could offer investors new avenues for exposure to the digital asset market. Several firms are poised to launch ETFs pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission. Among the prospective issuers awaiting approval are international arms of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital. Upon receiving regulatory approval, these firms have indicated their intent to launch ETFs investing in BTC and ETH, highlighting the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products in global markets.

Due to the recent momentum, crypto enthusiasts are becoming less pessimistic about the digital asset’s growth prior to the halving event. With the fast approaching much-anticipated Bitcoin Halving, Rekt Capital, a well-recognized cryptocurrency analyst and aficionado, has offered his market insights mapping out three distinct stages of the event for investors. 3 Distinct Aspects Of The Bitcoin Halving Rekt Capital’s analysis delves into Bitcoin‘s movement before and after the halving takes place, which is expected to happen this month. In the seven days leading up to the occurrence, the crypto analyst underscored three stages to observe for a successful outcome. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst These three phases include the final pre-halving retrace, the re-accumulation phase, and the parabolic uptrend phase. Emphasizing on the first aspect, Rekt Capital noted that the pre-halving retrace is documented in the books and has already manifested. During this period, Bitcoin experienced an 18% pullback compared to 2016 and 2020’s retracement of 38% and 19%, respectively. The expert believes that the concluded pre-halving Retrace was the last chance to purchase a deal during the pre-halving phase. Following the conclusion of the retrace, Rekt Capital has confirmed the development has laid the groundwork for the Re-accumulation range. It is important to note that the aforementioned range occurs a few weeks ahead of the halving, and it ends with a breakout from it a few weeks later. Specifically, the period could last for several weeks and up to 150 days or five months. Given the manifestation of the range, sideways movement through the halving and beyond is the major purpose of BTC. Thus, the analyst has stressed the need to be patient around this phase, as many investors get frustrated, bored, and disappointed here because their Bitcoin investments lack significant returns. As a result, they lose confidence and get shaken out of the market before the event. BTC’s Post-Halving Rally Might Mirror Previous Trend As for the parabolic uptrend, Rekt Capital claims the phase will begin when Bitcoin breaks out from the re-accumulation range. He further stated that the price of BTC tends to grow more quickly and enters a parabolic upsurge during this stage.

Rekt Capital’s key perspectives came amidst Bitcoin demonstrating strength to revisit its current all-time high of $73,000. BTC has managed to amass gains of more than 6% in the past few days. It recovered to the $70,000 level after plunging as low as $67,000 on Wednesday and is getting close to $71,000.

This achievement represents approximately 62.5% of all LTC addresses with a balance, underscoring Litecoin’s widespread adoption and long-term viability within the crypto community. Rising Long-Term Holder Trend Signals Optimism The surge in long-term holders has been particularly noticeable in recent months, underscoring a growing inclination towards holding LTC for quite a long time. In February’s closing days alone, the number of long-term holders soared by 170,000, signaling robust investor confidence in Litecoin’s long-term prospects.

In contrast, approximately 26.8% of LTC holders, totaling 2.15 million addresses, are currently at a loss. Meanwhile, a smaller segment, constituting 5.53% of holders, is situated at breakeven, which means they are neither in a loss nor a profit. Bullish Sentiment Surrounds Litecoin Amidst Rumors of ETF Approval So far, Litecoin has seen relatively stable movement, experiencing a minor increase of 0.3% over the past week, followed by a slight downturn of 0.1% in the last 24 hours. As of the current writing, LTC is trading at $96.72. Despite the altcoin’s current stability in price, analysts such as World of Charts anticipate a potential surge in the coming months, with projections suggesting a climb to $400. This bullish momentum is fuelled by growing institutional interest, particularly surrounding rumors of a potential LTC Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

This achievement represents approximately 62.5% of all LTC addresses with a balance, underscoring Litecoin’s widespread adoption and long-term viability within the crypto community. Rising Long-Term Holder Trend Signals Optimism The surge in long-term holders has been particularly noticeable in recent months, underscoring a growing inclination towards holding LTC for quite a long time. In February’s closing days alone, the number of long-term holders soared by 170,000, signaling robust investor confidence in Litecoin’s long-term prospects. In tandem with this surge in long-term holders, the number of individuals holding LTC for more than a year has steadily risen, now totaling 2.54 million addresses. Apart from the numerical growth, the profitability of holding LTC over the long term adds another dimension of interest. Amazing milestone for Litecoin! The network now counts over 5 million long-term holders of $LTC. This figure represents 62.5% of all Litecoin addresses with a balance. pic.twitter.com/K5FHz3Ivjs — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 12, 2024 According to on-chain data, roughly 67.67% of all LTC addresses currently stand in profit, collectively holding 49.76 million LTC. In contrast, approximately 26.8% of LTC holders, totaling 2.15 million addresses, are currently at a loss. Meanwhile, a smaller segment, constituting 5.53% of holders, is situated at breakeven, which means they are neither in a loss nor a profit. Bullish Sentiment Surrounds Litecoin Amidst Rumors of ETF Approval So far, Litecoin has seen relatively stable movement, experiencing a minor increase of 0.3% over the past week, followed by a slight downturn of 0.1% in the last 24 hours. As of the current writing, LTC is trading at $96.72. Despite the altcoin’s current stability in price, analysts such as World of Charts anticipate a potential surge in the coming months, with projections suggesting a climb to $400. This bullish momentum is fuelled by growing institutional interest, particularly surrounding rumors of a potential LTC Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett has hinted at institutional intrigue towards a Litecoin ETF, citing LTC’s functional similarities to Bitcoin as a potential factor in its approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

This history-making agreement marks UFC’s first-ever top-level blockchain partnership, while VeChain gains a powerful platform to reach fight fans around the world. UFC Flexes Financial Muscle This strategic alliance injects a significant revenue boost for UFC, exceeding their previous sponsorship records according to UFC’s senior vice president of global partnerships, Paul Asencio. The deal also positions the MMA giant at the forefront of a burgeoning trend, as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry continues its meteoric rise. VeChain Poised For Global Exposure For VeChain, the partnership presents a golden opportunity. Their brand will be thrust into the global spotlight, reaching an estimated 900 million television households across 175 countries. This unprecedented exposure will be amplified through prominent placement within UFC events, including branding on the iconic Octagon canvas and digital displays. The blockchain firm will also co-create content with UFC for their digital platforms, further solidifying their presence in the combat sports landscape. A Deeper Dive Into The Partnership This partnership goes beyond simple logo placements. VeChain’s branding will be woven into the very fabric of UFC events. The “official blockchain partner” will see their logo displayed prominently within the Octagon, the center stage for all UFC fights. This constant visual reminder will serve as a powerful marketing tool for VeChain, keeping their name at the forefront of fight fans’ minds. The partnership extends beyond branding and content creation. An annual “Brand Ambassador Fund” will offer paid opportunities for UFC athletes to participate in VeChain marketing initiatives. This innovative approach leverages the immense popularity of UFC fighters to further amplify the company’s reach and connect with a passionate fanbase. Not UFC’s First Crypto Dance This isn’t UFC’s first foray into the world of cryptocurrency. They previously partnered with Crypto.com, a leading crypto exchange, which resulted in fan bonuses being awarded in Bitcoin. Additionally, UFC collaborated with NFT creator Dapper Labs to release a series of officially licensed non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These ventures demonstrate UFC’s willingness to embrace innovative technologies and explore new revenue streams within the ever-evolving financial landscape. The partnership signifies a pivotal moment in the convergence of professional sports and blockchain technology. As VeChain leverages UFC’s massive global audience, this deal has the potential to not only propel VeChain’s brand recognition but also educate fight fans about the possibilities of blockchain technology.

According to the crypto sleuth, the group was responsible for sizable thefts from projects like Magnate, Kokomo, Lendora, and Solfire. These scammers usually accumulate assets totaling seven figures before absconding with users’ funds. Malicious Actors Targeting Ethereum Layer-2 Networks In an extensive report, ZachXBT disclosed that the fraudulent syndicate successfully laundered around $1 million in illicit funds. The group is now using these funds to entice unsuspecting individuals to Leaper Finance, a decentralized lending protocol operating on the Blast network. Expanding their nefarious activities, ZachXBT has uncovered potential links between the group and another lending protocol named Zebra Lending, situated on the Base network. The investigator highlighted that the deployer of Zebra Lending is associated with an address connected to funds from Lendora and Magnate Finance protocols. Zebra Lending boasts over $300,000 in assets locked within its protocol.

This raises concerns over users’ potential exposure to malicious attacks. However, Telegram, known for its crypto-friendly messaging platform, has refuted these claims, asserting that such a vulnerability is absent within its system. Alleged Vulnerability on Telegram Certik claimed that Telegram’s desktop application, specifically its media processing functionality, contained a significant Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It allegedly exposes users to attacks through media files like images or videos. The firm specified that the vulnerability affects only desktop apps that execute programs contained within files. However, the mobile application remains unaffected. Telegram swiftly responded to CertiK’s claims, stating that it could not verify the vulnerability and suggesting it could be misinformation. However, CertiK demonstrated an RCE attack on Telegram’s latest Windows desktop version, reinforcing its initial claim. Consequently, it advised users to exercise caution until a complete resolution is reached. We REPRODUCED one RCE attack to the latest TG Desktop on Windows (release version 4.16.6 x64).

Still, Telegram has since addressed CertiK’s renewed disclosure, citing a recent server-side fix for a similar issue. The firm clarified that the resolved vulnerability required specific user interactions and advanced conditions. “Certik posted this after we notified them about a server-side fix for an issue which was similar to the one they initially hinted at (but required user interaction; required the user to have Python installed; and could not be triggered by automatic downloads),” Telegram said.

According to the report, the number of financing in the digital asset space increased by 50% in March to reach $1.6 million compared to February. The month witnessed a resurgence in institutional investments, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to a new all-time high above $73,000 after a two-year downturn. Pushed by positive market sentiments, investors directed funds into 180 crypto projects across various sectors. Market Dynamics and Investment Trends The KuCoin research found a continuous growth trend in both the number and scale of investment and financing projects compared to the previous year. The company said the growth signals a robust revival in the primary investment market within the current crypto economy. While the financing scale between $10 and $100 million notably increased from 16.6% in February to 28.81% in March, seed-stage financing projects saw a slight decline from 40.86% to 37.8%. Despite this increase, strategic stage financing projects surged to 22.83% from 16.13%. Blockchain Performance and Investor Focus In terms of blockchain performance, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Polygon (MATIC) projects attracted substantial investor attention, especially following Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling solutions after the Dencun upgrade. While Bitcoin and Polygon remained strong, Ethereum, through its layer-2 scaling solutions, topped the chart after the Dencun upgrade. For active venture capital companies participating in the crypto industry, OKX Ventures leads the way, emerging as the leader among other investors. The company participated in a total of 20 projects in March, followed by MH and Waterdrip. When it comes to the top ten sectors that received significant attention from venture capital, key sectors such as Infrastructure (Infra), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Games dominated venture capital investments. In March, investment institutions favored themes revolving around AI, DEX, and Lending projects. Market Momentum and Future Outlook March showcased a bullish trend for the entire crypto market, particularly propelled by Bitcoin’s surge to new heights. On March 12, Bitcoin’s spot ETF recorded a new historical high for single-day net inflows, reaching $1.05 billion. With the Bitcoin ETF’s historical inflow, the options and futures market saw significant Open Interest (OI) growth, reflecting an increased capital influx. However, a significant delivery in the options market on March 29 caused the OI to slide.

This decline was instigated by heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly Iran’s attack on Israel. Iran’s Attack Spurs Crypto Market Decline The crypto market experienced a significant price crash, with several altcoins plunging by double digits in response to Iran’s actions. Bitcoin, for instance, saw a rapid decline of $6,000 within minutes of the attack, as the flagship digital asset tumbled from around $68,000 to as low as $60,800 before rebounding to $64,400 at the time of reporting. Similarly, Ethereum dropped from around $3,200 to $2,800 before recovering to $3,000. Other assets such as BNB, Solana, and Dogecoin also experienced declines of 5%, 8%, and 10% respectively over the past 24 hours. These developments resulted in significant losses for traders. Data from Coinglass reveals that approximately $962.40 million was lost, predominantly by bullish position holders who suffered losses of $771.76 million. In comparison, short traders incurred losses of $199.63 million due to the market downturn. Crypto Market Liquidation Heatmap.

Moreover, prices are nearer to the trader’s realized price of $58,000,” Moreno added. Bitcoin Realized Price.

Notably, the heavily sanctioned country stated that it considered the matter concluded but cautioned of more severe responses if Israel makes another “mistake.” “Iran’s military action was in response to the Zionist regime’s aggression against our diplomatic premises in Damascus. The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe.

BitBot too continued its token sale, raising over $2 million. Why cryptocurrencies plunged There are three main reasons why cryptocurrencies crashed during the weekend. First, crypto investors are likely selling the news as the Bitcoin halving event is set to happen in less than two weeks. This situation is known as buying the rumour and selling the news. They have already bought the rumour as the coin has surged from below $20,000 to a high of over $73,000. Second, they crashed because of the geopolitical risks that accelerated during the weekend. Iran retaliated against Israel by firing over 300 drones and rockets. Most of these strikes were unsuccessful, helped by the country’s iron dome. These tensions mean that the price of crude oil could continue rising in the coming weeks. Brent, the global benchmark, has already jumped to a multi-month high of $92. Third, there are signs that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates in the coming months as was widely expected. That explains why the US dollar index has jumped while US equities and bonds have retreated. Still, in the long term, analysts believe that cryptocurrencies will continue doing well because of Bitcoin. Besides, the coin is still getting rare because of halving while institutional investors are moving to the coin. BitBot token sale intensifies BitBot is thriving even as the crypto sell-off continues. The developers have already raised over $2.3 million from investors and are slowly nearing stage ten’s target of $2.5 million. For starters, BitBot is one of the most ambitious companies in the blockchain industry. The developers are aiming to disrupt the fast-growing Telegram bot market that has been rife with fraud for years. BitBot will be a Telegram bot with some of the most advanced features in the industry. In addition to technical indicators, the platform will have advanced artificial intelligence (AI) features that will help give near-accurate signals. Further, BitBot will be powered by blockchain technology, which will help to reduce or prevent fraud.

US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform Efforts by the US Congress to establish a robust regulatory framework for stablecoins may have picked up new momentum. This follows after two high-ranking lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday to discuss the way forward. According to the initial report by Punchbowl News, the meeting was held in Schumer’s office, shortly after the Japanese prime minister jointly addressed Congress the same day. Patrick McHenry and Maxine Waters Keen on Stablecoin Reform Reps. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have, so far, been very consistent in their bid to see the committee’s stablecoin bill passed into law. So much so that their efforts played a huge part in the bill’s passing at the House committee, albeit with a bipartisan vote. However, not much progress has been made since that passing, therefore blurring any hopes that the bill may be passed into law this year. First off, getting a floor vote in a House where there is ongoing infighting, especially among top Republicans, would be a difficult task. Also, the Senate Banking Committee hasn’t lent any support or has shown any interest in the idea up until now. Despite these potential setbacks, however, McHenry and Waters are not willing to give up just yet. According to sources familiar with what was discussed on Thursday, the duo is looking to tie the stablecoin bill to a must-move item, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spending bill. For McHenry, getting his panel’s stablecoin bill passed for President Joe Biden to sign into law is one of his priorities before retiring from Congress later this year. With Schumer now in the picture, there is a glimmer of hope that legislation that will guide issuers of stablecoins may just see the light of day. As of publication, efforts to reach out to McHenry and Waters for commentary have not yet yielded any results. Call for Cooperation Meanwhile, the meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a wake-up call for lawmakers around the world. It is an encouragement for them to double their efforts in advancing the stablecoin reform agenda. However, as the debate surrounding stablecoin regulation continues to gain traction, it will all boil down to the collective resolve of lawmakers to address regulatory uncertainties for this fast-evolving digital economy to attain success in the future. next US Lawmakers Continue Their Push for Stablecoin Reform","category":["Altcoin News","Cryptocurrency News","News","joe biden","maxine waters","patrick mchenry","stablecoin","stablecoin reform stablecoin bill"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e237","guid":"https://themerkle.com/?p=80498","article_link":"https://themerkle.com/trending-high-bitgert-coin-dominates-as-the-crypto-of-the-week/","website_source":"themerkle","article_title":"Trending High: Bitgert Coin Dominates as the Crypto of the Week","author":"Will Izuchukwu","creation_date":"2024-04-12T20:04:54Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"Amidst the ocean of very dynamic cryptocurrency projects and innovations, Bitgert is a project with very evident growth and potential.

It is exploding onto the scene as a favorite with the highest and cutting-edge solutions. Now, let’s look at what makes Bitgert stand out. The Bitgert Ecosystem Bitgert is an outstanding crypto initiative aspiring to bring radical changes into the blockchain space with a wide spectrum of products and audit solutions. In less than 200 days since launch, the project launched its own Blockchain, BRISE Wallet, Audits, Swap, Staking, and the Bitgert Exchange service, which confirms a rapid pace of development in the ecosystem. This project has many appealing investment side deals: staking rewards paid in BUSD and a strategically devised buyback plan to improve the value and rareness of the token. Bitgert currently trades at a market capitalization of $77,690,191, with a fully diluted valuation of $83,850,485, noting that they have a lively 24-hour trading volume of $2,219,396. Bitgert hit an all-time high of $0.0000051842 on March 7, 2022, which is 89.3% over the current value. Its all-time low price was at $0.0000000096166 on September 9, 2021, way higher by 31,797.12% now, evidently showing how the project moved from the price most importantly in its development. Bitgert had declined by 8.50% in price over the past week. However, with all this innovation and their ability to deploy blockchain products so fast, Bitgert remains one of the projects with quite good potential in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Major Advantages Posed by BRISE Below are some of the benefits that Bitgert (BRISE) would bring to the crypto market, thus making it an outstanding option for consideration: Bitgert introduced BRC20 blockchain, remarkable for making its users pay almost no gas fees, literally 0.0000000000001 dollars for the whole transaction. This innovation would place Bitgert as one of the lowest-cost options to place, further reducing the barrier that costs represent in transactions within the blockchain. The throughput capacity for the BRC20 blockchain is up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). This, therefore, brings a very high transaction speed that is efficient even in cross-chain transactions. This kind of speed is good enough to make sure that users’ experiences are not undermined, like waiting for too long to process a given transaction, even during peak times. The Bitgert ecosystem duly covers DeFi, NFT, Web 3.0, and Metaverse, putting the project to its place as a one-stop-shop service for all your needs in many different blockchain technologies. Bitgert token is engineered with a buy-back mechanism specific for reserving 5% of every transaction fee to acquire tokens and support token price, thus making it a deflationary asset. Besides, the staking benefits the investor with a total tax commission of 12% on the network, encouraging holding for the long term and attracting investment on the platform. End Call Bitgert is the best crypto right now, which you can buy in/hold if you believe in the ecosystem’s future sustainability. The entire ecosystem is utility-driven, probing investors with optimistic return potentials for the future. Regardless, individual research and risk appetite knowledge are always mandatory before final buy-in.

It eclipses MAGA and the Pepe Coin price predictions this year despite these two established projects enjoying excellent performance in Q1 2024. While MAGA and Pepe Coin prices rise, meme coin enthusiasts have been drawn to the Raboo presale, which recently launched at just $0.0036. As analysts forecast 233% returns during the ICO, it is no wonder many experts have Raboo topping their list of hot meme coins this year. Raboo: Meme coin newcomer fusing AI and meme culture Raboo’s highly anticipated presale has caught the imagination for many reasons. Its fully audited contract makes the most of Ethereum’s renowned reliability and security, allowing users to enjoy an engagement-focused approach. This includes prize draws, competitions, and regular events to keep the Raboo community fully engaged. The enduring combination of SocialFi mechanics and AI technology enables users to generate memes and share them across social media platforms in return for rewards through Raboo’s unique Post-to-Earn platform. Other features include an NFT launch, an online marketplace, and several other exciting community initiatives designed to fulfill Raboo’s promise as one of 2024’s hot meme coins. With 233% price growth forecasts during the presale giving way to potential 100x returns on launch day, meme enthusiasts are flocking to Raboo, one of the year’s hot meme coins, in their thousands. Pepe Coin price surges – can it maintain momentum Pepe was one of 2023’s hot meme coins, surging to a $1.5 billion market cap within weeks of launching despite confessing to little inherent value. However, as the Pepe Coin price significantly surged in Q1 2024, the Pepe community has grown loyal, vibrant, and engaged. Pepe’s integration of NFTs allows users to own and trade unique digital assets. At the same time, the Pepe Coin price receives boosts from regular token burns and excellent token staking opportunities in return for a passive income. With a growing community focus and big-name celebrity backing, experts back the Pepe Coin price to beat its current ATH set on March 14, 2024, sooner rather than later. Can MAGA go viral during election year? With the US election only months away, MAGA (Make America Great Again) and its native TRUMP token are enjoying serious price action. Although remaining well short of its ATH of $11.63, recorded on March 4, 2024, MAGA’s current price of $4.64 is again rising as popular support for the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump surges. Whether MAGA can usurp its record levels and the candidate it backs can retake the White House remains to be seen. Still, with meme enthusiasts enjoying the wild ride offered by the TRUMP token, it would take a brave soul to bet against both happening during the imminent bull market. Conclusion While the MAGA and Pepe Coin prices continue to grow, having recently set ATHs, the meme coin market is bubbling nicely ahead of the imminent Bitcoin halving. However, both could be eclipsed by one of the hot meme coins joining the scene this year, Raboo. With outstanding features and enormous growth potential, Raboo could be the crypto find of the year.

Core developers are scrambling to fix network congestion issues that have emerged as the platform’s popularity skyrocketed. The source of the problem, according to many, is the QUIC protocol implementation, struggling to keep pace with the surge in demand.

According to on-chain data, a 0.001 BTC test transaction, part of a larger stash of approximately 30,174 BTC worth $2 billion linked to the infamous Silk Road marketplace, were moved by the US government. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, received the transaction from these Silk Road-related funds. Arkham Intelligence first identified the origins of where the BTC was coming from, and the coins destination of Coinbase. It appears the purpose of this transaction is to sell the coins, as it has previously done in the past. Last March, the U.S. government sold off 10,000 bitcoin related to Silk Road, selling just over 9,861 BTC worth $216 million, according to a court filing. As in this case, this event was proceeded by 3 on-chain transactions, which were sent a few weeks prior to the sale's disclosure in a court filing. The U.S. Marshals Service is one of the largest Bitcoin sellers to date. According to data from researcher Jameson Lopp, the US Marshals have helped the US government sell 195,000 BTC. Despite attempts by U.S. lawmakers to have the agency hold these funds as a strategic asset, it has continued to sell the funds in line with its mandate, the role of the U.S. Marshalls Service being to sell off assets confiscated in criminal investigations.","category":["Bitcoin","News","Markets","Government","US","Silk Road"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1bb","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-revenue-record-high-2-billion-march","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","article_title":"Bitcoin Miners Monthly Revenue Hit Record $2 Billion","author":"Vivek Sen","creation_date":"2024-04-02T18:58:30Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk5NTIzMTk3NTA5NDQ1MjQ4/what-is-bitcoin-mining.png","article_summary":"Bitcoin miners generated a record $2 billion in monthly revenue in March between block rewards and fees, setting a new high ahead of the upcoming halving event.","article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin mining businesses generated their highest-ever monthly revenue in March, raking in over $2 billion in block rewards and transaction fees. This shatters the previous record of $1.74 billion set back in May 2021. JUST IN: #Bitcoin Miners hit a record $2 billion in monthly revenue, highest ever. Halving coming in hot in 2 weeks 🙌 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 2, 2024 Of the $2 billion earned last month, around $85 million came from transaction fees, while $1.93 billion was from the block subsidy. (Miners receive compensation both for validating transactions and minting new bitcoins.) The block subsidy, paid out for each block mined, is currently 6.25 bitcoins. But it will drop to 3.125 bitcoins after the upcoming halving event in April. This will cut miner revenue from new bitcoin creation in half unless there is a significant price rise. Higher network activity and increasing bitcoin prices both contributed to miners' bumper revenues in March. The upcoming halving created urgency for miners to maximize earnings before profits are squeezed. The leading US mining pool, Foundry, captured 29.4% of all blocks mined in March. Chinese pool AntPool took second place with 22.4% of blocks. The two captured over half the monthly Bitcoin supply. While miners enjoyed their profit bonanza last month, exchange-traded funds purchasing bitcoins on the open market accumulated even more. ETFs bought roughly 66,000 bitcoins in March, while miners only produced around 25,500. This widening supply-demand imbalance and halving-related scarcity could spur greater competition to secure Bitcoin. The resulting difficulty increases may start pricing out less efficient miners, spurring industry consolidation. With the halving cutting rewards in half in a matter of weeks, miners face an increasingly harsh environment if Bitcoin's price fails to compensate for the drop in issuance. But if history repeats, a strong bitcoin bull run could still be on the horizon, softening the revenue blow of reduced block subsidies.","category":["Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1ce","guid":"https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602908","article_link":"https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-sell-pressure-price/","website_source":"newsbtc","article_title":"Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Is Dropping – Here’s What It Means For Price","author":"Scott Matherson","creation_date":"2024-04-13T00:30:27Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Shiba-Inu-3.jpeg?fit=297%2C170","article_summary":"The majority of Shiba Inu investors have been left confused about the crypto’s price trajectory in the past few weeks. While the crypto has experienced a period of stagnation in the past two weeks, recent on-chain data shows that the outlook might be looking bullish again, particularly as selling has slowed dramatically this week. At the same time, Shiba Inu has now crossed a major milestone in the number of addresses, which could mean an increase in the number of holders. Shiba Inu Sell Pressure Drops The price of Shiba Inu can easily be moved by selling and buying pressure from investors. Recent on-chain data, however, indicates that the selling pressure is currently decreasing, which could manifest in the price of the SHIB in the coming week. Particularly, IntoTheBlock’s historical active address by profitability shows the yearly average now shifting towards wallet addresses at the money. Related Reading: XRP Sees An Alarming 1,800% Surge In Liquidations, Whats Going On? Interestingly, this cohort of traders is now at almost 74.6%, meaning they contribute to the majority of the buying and selling action. However, their “at the money status” doesn’t give a clear path to their actions, as they could either be selling or increasing their holdings at the current price. On the other hand, this metric indicates better action among the active portion of addresses that are “in the money.” Interestingly, these “in the money” addresses have now seen their year-to-date activity average falling below 18%. This cohort of traders, who would normally be selling after reaching profits on their holdings, have failed to conduct a tangible number of transactions. Interestingly, this indicates they might be opting to hold right now in order to increase their unrealized profits. Similarly, on-chain data shows a substantial amount of SHIB moving out of the hands of short-term holders, contributing to a drop in selling pressure. About 4% of the entire circulating supply of SHIB has moved from short-term holders to mid-term holders in the past week. Mid-term holders hold their assets for more than a month to a year, in contrast to short-term holders, who are known for holding for less than a month before selling. Source: IntoTheBlock What’s Next For SHIB? With decreasing sell pressure and a shift to longer holding times, SHIB is poised for a reversal and continued upward momentum. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002766, down by 1.1% in the past 24 hours and up by 4.65% in a larger 7-day timeframe.

Trading volumes for spot and futures surged 100% compared to the prior quarter, while Bitget’s native BGB token value soared 80% during Q1 2024, solidifying Bitget’s position as a major player in the crypto. The futures trading volume reached US$1.4 trillion, signifying a substantial 146% surge compared to Q4 2023. Moreover, the spot trading witnessed an equally remarkable performance, surpassing US$160 billion, representing a 113% increase. Consequently, Bitget’s market share in the derivatives market experienced a notable 2.4% growth in March 2024. The success wasn’t limited to trading activity.

Some tokens, such as XAI, GPT, and PIXEL, experienced an appreciable increase in price, surpassing an astonishing high of 3000%. Apart from its core products, Bitget places emphasis on its role in society and the need to have a vibrant community. Among these are publishing a gender imbalance report, unveiling Blockchain4Her project worth $10 million as well as electing three experts from the industry as brand representatives.

Trust Wallet Introduces MEV Protection for Secure and Fair Crypto Transactions","article_detailed_content":"Coinspeaker Trust Wallet Introduces MEV Protection for Secure and Fair Crypto Transactions Trust Wallet, a leading crypto wallet and Web3 gateway with over 80 million users, has made an advancement by introducing Miner Extractable Value (MEV) Protection. This new feature ensures the security and fairness of crypto transactions. The implementation of this solution is a direct response to user complaints about technical issues and hacking incidents, showing the wallet’s commitment to improving the overall crypto experience for its large user base. MEV Protection coincides with an upgrade to Trust Wallet’s Swaps feature, which now allows seamless exchanges with over 1 million token pairs across multiple networks and providers. This dual advancement showcases its dedication to facilitating secure swaps in the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding MEV and Its Impact Miner Extractable Value is a concept in the blockchain industry that refers to the potential profit miners, validators, and other participants can gain by manipulating the order, censorship, or insertion of transactions within a block. These attacks exploit this vulnerability, enabling malicious actors to manipulate transaction orders for personal gain. They result in increased slippage, less favorable execution prices, and an unfair trading experience for regular users. MEV Protection: A Comprehensive Solution The introduction of MEV Protection is aimed at countering this attack. The security measure safeguards users’ swaps from front-running and sandwich attacks, which are common tactics used by bad actors in the crypto space. Front-running involves exploiting knowledge of a pending transaction to execute a similar transaction before it, thereby manipulating the market price. Sandwich attacks, on the other hand, require trapping a legitimate transaction between two malicious ones to profit from price slippage. The MEV protocol ensures that users receive fair market prices for their swaps, protecting them from the risk of paying more or receiving less than the prevailing market rate. This feature benefits both experienced traders and those new to crypto, creating a safer and more secure environment for all swap participants. Easy Access to MEV Protection Accessing this new feature is a simple process. Users can select the swap option from the bottom menu, click on the settings button in the top right corner, and enable the MEV protection features. This will also make it available on all devices connected to the account, ensuring a seamless and secure trading experience and automatically opting users in for an additional layer of security from the beginning. This approach further showcases its commitment to transparency and providing a user-focused Web3 experience. In addition, the crypto wallet further places a strong emphasis on user education and empowerment, ensuring that its community is well-informed about the security measures that it has put in place. The introduction of this new development has received praise from the Trust Wallet community. “That’s awesome! Congratulations on adding MEV Protection. Now we can swap with peace of mind.

In Trusted Data Markets, organizations issue verifiable data to holders, who actively exchange it with interested parties known as “Verifiers” who desire to validate the data. The cheqd platform through its public permissionless network is developing the first payment rails, Decentralized Identities (DIDs), governance frameworks to support Trusted Data, and flexible commercial models. At the heart of the cheqd platform is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Blockchain technology, expected to offer the framework and trust layer required to support Trusted Data marketplaces. According to the details of the partnership, Andromeda, which acts as an application’s platform layer, will help build cheqd’s Web3 developer community by providing access to secure, user-controlled data solutions. Notably, Andromeda will help provide the tools aOS developers require to create high-level Decentralized Applications (dApps) with improved data management and trust, resulting in more satisfying, user-centric experiences. The partnership will also be beneficial to Andromeda as it is expected to spur growth and innovation in the ecosystem, allowing for the rapid proliferation of decentralized networks. cheqd to Enhance AI Trust cheqd will be equally crucial in driving Devolved AI’s objective to democratize the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem. Devolved AI is a Layer-1 blockchain committed to encouraging global participation in the creation of Athena LLM, an advanced Large Language Model. The platform has a central goal of redefining the relationship between AI and humanity, thus equipping individuals with the ability to vote, earn rewards and play a role in the future of AI technology. Through the partnership with cheqd, Devolved AI will leverage cheqd’s innovations in DIDs and Trusted Data Markets to develop a unique decentralized reputation system that rewards contributors. Accordingly, Devolved AI can ensure that its users have complete control over their digital personalities, allowing them to engage in a trusted manner without disclosing their identities. It is important to note that cheqd’s Trusted Data Markets will be critical in ensuring the quality and reliability of the data used to train its AI. This will make certain it meets the demand for intelligent models that are completely ethical and transparent. Last year, cheqd unveiled an unique innovation called Creds, which serves as a private and secure platform that transforms how trust is built and maintained in the realm of AI. Crucially, Devolved AI’s decentralized reputation system will be developed on top of cheqd’s architecture to review how credibility in Web3 is established and maintained. Overall, Devolved AI is establishing an ecosystem for artificial intelligence development in which trust will be one of the most valuable credentials in a community that values honesty.next cheqd Partners with Andromeda and Devolved AI to Enhance Trusted Data Markets","category":["Artificial Intelligence","News","Technology News","Andromeda","artificial intelligence","Cheqd","devolved ai"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e244","guid":"https://coinjournal.net/?p=198309","article_link":"https://coinjournal.net/news/99bitcoins-launches-learn-to-earn-presale-and-raises-150k-on-first-day/","website_source":"coinjournal.net","article_title":"99Bitcoins Launches Learn-To-Earn Presale and Raises $150K On First Day","author":"Chainwire &#160;","creation_date":"2024-04-12T17:20:22Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"New York, United States, April 12th, 2024, Chainwire 99Bitcoins, established in 2013, has recently begun its token presale in an effort to harness the current upward trend in Bitcoin’s value.

The 99BTC team, seizing this opportunity, offers its learn-to-earn platform, a longstanding resource in cryptocurrency education. What is 99Bitcoins? 99Bitcoins has been breaking down technical concepts and onboarding newcomers to the crypto world for over ten years as the team can show by the numbers on its social media accounts: over 700,000 YouTube followers, 16,000 Twitter followers and 2 million registered users have confirmed its +80 hours of resources are a great entry point for those looking to learn more about crypto. The $99BTC token is its latest venture. The team promotes its commitment to education by introducing the “gamification of learning” into the platform, providing $99BTC rewards for those who complete its courses, such as exclusive access to premium content, discounts on partner products and services, VIP communities, trading signals, and token holder events. The 99Bitcoins team aims to attract all the potential new users who are expected to enter the crypto space and explore Bitcoin in light of the upcoming halving; the event, which will occur this month, is expected to increase the number of first-time crypto enthusiasts as confirmed by multiple researches and major sources like CoinTelegraph and CoinDesk. Pioneering BRC-20: Pushing Learn-to-Earn in new directions 99Bitcoins is also trying to set itself as a pioneer of the BRC-20 movement: a new token standard that allows developers to deploy smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Security and transparency are also key to this project, a Solidproof audit confirms that 99Bitcoins contract does have no potential issues or warnings. It’s worth noting $99BTC is originally deployed as an ERC-20 token and that it will be bridged to BRC-20 only in Q4 2024, transferring the security of the project to the Bitcoin network. When it comes to the tokenomics (renamed to Token Metrics by its team), 99Bitcoins is distributing its 99 billion $99BTC total supply with the goal of helping it remain competitive and provide lasting sustainability: 15% is allocated to the presale, which is currently selling $99BTC for $0.001 14% for staking rewards, providing $99BTC stakers with rewards for two years 23% is allocated to project funds 17% for community rewards 8% to provide liquidity to exchanges 23% for marketing This tokenomics structure is then paired with an ambitious roadmap which would target the beta release of the platform to last quarter this year, followed by the full release next year. About 99Bitcoins 99Bitcoins is a vital educational resource for Bitcoin. It focuses on providing information about cryptocurrency to onboard new users to the industry. The website was established in 2013 and has since expanded its knowledge base to popular blockchains and cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. The platform now brings a gamification element to its product, allowing students to receive $99BTC rewards in a L2E economy. The $99BTC token is also pioneering the BRC-20 movement, a new token standard that enables smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin network.

The company installed and activated over 5,000 T21 miners at two facilities in Québec, Canada. Bitfarms installed 3,168 T21s devices at its Garlock, Québec facility, plus 1,710 T21s and 100 M53S+ hydro miners at its Farnham, Québec site. The latest upgrades improve energy efficiency by about 51%. Geoff Morphy, President and CEO of Bitfarms, emphasized the benefit of efficiency, asserting the “transformative nature of [the] upgrade plan.” He noted that greater efficiency prepares the company for Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event. Bitfarms intends to deploy another 30,000 miners this quarter. The company will introduce these upgrades in existing locations, including its new Paso Pe, Paraguay facility. The 30,000 deployments will help the company approach its 2024 targets of 12 EH/s and 21 EH/s. Halving is fast approaching Bitfarms is just one of many companies expanding ahead of Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event, which is expected to occur on April 19. CleanSpark announced on April 12 that it expanded its hash rate to 17 EH/s. CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford said the company is “well-suited” for the halving, both because of its own efficiency and because competitors’ old, inefficient machines will leave the network. Marathon said in a Bloomberg interview in March that it plans to expand in light of the halving. Hut 8 said in February that the halving would provide opportunities for future growth and announced plans to construct a new Texas facility. Cipher Mining and Stronghold Digital Mining also announced expansions in January. The halving will reduce mining rewards per block. Not accounting for possible fluctuations in BTC prices, lower rewards will likely reduce profitability for some mining companies. However, lower profits can potentially be offset by more efficient operations.

Ripple just unlocked a massive amount of tokens from escrow, which could threaten the price further. Ripple Unlocks 500 Million XRP In the early hours of Friday, on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert posted two transactions carrying a notable number of XRP tokens. The first transaction saw 200 million tokens unlocked from the escrow wallet, worth $122.63 million at the time of the transfer. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Crashing To $0.4 As Important Metrics Turn Bearish The second transaction came minutes later when a total of 300 million XRP tokens were also unclosed from escrow. This second tranche of tokens, being larger than the first, was worth $183.89 million at the time, bringing the total number of unlocked tokens to 500 million. Together, both transactions were worth over $300 million. These unlocks have, unsurprisingly, stirred concern in the Ripple community for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that Ripple never does unlocks in the middle of the month. Rather, they do scheduled unlocks at the start of each month. So, these transactions have drawn the attention of the crypto community. Another cause for concern is the fact that Ripple could be selling these XRP tokens. Hence, putting more tokens in circulation and adding more selling pressure to the already struggling digital asset. However, Ripple has not shown any indication of what these unlocks could be for as there have been no transfer transactions since then, just the unlock transactions. Unlocks Can Send Price Crashing? XRP unlocks are not new to the Ripple community, as scheduled unlocks take place every month. These unlocks see 1 billion XRP tokens unlocked from the escrow according to schedule. But most times, the majority of the unlocked tokens are sent back to escrow. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Price Will Reach $0.0001 If This Happens Usually, these unlocks do not negatively affect the altcoin’s price, but that’s when the unlocks are expected. This time around, the unlocks are unplanned, leading to speculation as to why Ripple would be unlocking XRP tokens outside of the unlock schedule. So far, the XRP price seems to not be reacting to the unlock at all. It continues to trend around $0.61, with small losses of 0.91% in the last day. However, the altcoin is still seeing 4.74% gains in the last week, showing the positive upside that it saw earlier in the week.

The first transaction saw 200 million tokens unlocked from the escrow wallet, worth $122.63 million at the time of the transfer. The second transaction came minutes later when a total of 300 million XRP tokens were also unclosed from escrow. This second tranche of tokens, being larger than the first, was worth $183.89 million at the time, bringing the total number of unlocked tokens to 500 million. Together, both transactions were worth over $300 million. These unlocks have, unsurprisingly, stirred concern in the Ripple community for a number of reasons. One of the reasons is that Ripple never does unlocks in the middle of the month. Rather, they do scheduled unlocks at the start of each month. So, these transactions have drawn the attention of the crypto community. Another cause for concern is the fact that Ripple could be selling these XRP tokens. Hence, putting more tokens in circulation and adding more selling pressure to the already struggling digital asset. However, Ripple has not shown any indication of what these unlocks could be for as there have been no transfer transactions since then, just the unlock transactions. Unlocks Can Send Price Crashing? XRP unlocks are not new to the Ripple community, as scheduled unlocks take place every month. These unlocks see 1 billion XRP tokens unlocked from the escrow according to schedule. But most times, the majority of the unlocked tokens are sent back to escrow. Usually, these unlocks do not negatively affect the altcoin’s price, but that’s when the unlocks are expected. This time around, the unlocks are unplanned, leading to speculation as to why Ripple would be unlocking XRP tokens outside of the unlock schedule. So far, the XRP price seems to not be reacting to the unlock at all. It continues to trend around $0.61, with small losses of 0.91% in the last day. However, the altcoin is still seeing 4.74% gains in the last week, showing the positive upside that it saw earlier in the week.","category":["XRP","Ripple","ripple news","xrp","xrp news","XRP Price","XRPUSD","xrpusdt"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1e9","guid":"\n                https://Blockchain.News/news/nilam-resources-announces-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-24-800-bitcoin\n            ","article_link":"https://Blockchain.News/news/nilam-resources-announces-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-24-800-bitcoin","website_source":"blockchain.news","article_title":"Nilam Resources Announces Letter of Intent to Acquire 24,800 Bitcoin","author":"blockchain.news","creation_date":"2024-03-27T16:58:40Z","thumbnail_image":"https://blockchainstock.blob.core.windows.net:443/features/F88E3C730A90099625D57EA154464F96C29A298A0DD55AD50184BBC3A2BBF42F.jpg","article_summary":"Nilam Resources, Inc. has entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Xyberdata Ltd to acquire 100% of the common stock of a special purpose entity named MindWave.

The rise of DEGEN and DOG as frontrunners in the memecoin market signals a potential reconfiguration of the landscape, with new contenders challenging the dominance of established players like Dogecoin.

Avalanche (AVAX) forms cross-chain asset settlements with ANZ and Chainlink, sparking bullish predictions after its recent price decline. Filecoin (FIL) sees a 12% surge with its Swan Chain integration. In recent weeks, Milei Moneda ($MEDA) has emerged among top contenders in crypto presales, capturing the attention of new investors eager to capitalize on its strong presale potential. Alongside the bullish potential of $MEDA, the crypto market is witnessing notable developments with Avalanche (AVAX) and Filecoin (FIL). Let’s explore these bullish crypto stories. Milei Moneda eyes 60% ROI for early investors As digital investors seek the best coins to invest in for substantial returns, one name that keeps popping up is Milei Moneda ($MEDA). The DeFi meme coin has been making waves with its unique blend of humor, politics, and blockchain technology infused with Anarcho-capitalism. Milei Moneda ($MEDA) is an Ethereum Network-based deflationary token boasting locked liquidity and a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Its deflationary feature and strategic distribution system have made Milei Moneda ($MEDA) one of the top sorted altcoins, with the meme coin recording a sale of over 56 million tokens in just weeks since its presale debut. Currently selling at $0.0125 in Stage 2 of its presale, $MEDA is getting close to its highly anticipated launch on Uniswap. Scheduled for May 21, Milei Moneda’s DeFi coin price is set to launch at $0.020, translating to a 60% ROI for Stage 2 investors. This promising outlook has added to the excitement surrounding the price recovery of top altcoins Avalanche (AVAX) and Filecoin (FIL). Avalanche teams up with ANZ for cross-chain asset settlements Avalanche (AVAX) recently announced a partnership with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) and Chainlink (LINK) Labs. This collaboration aims to leverage Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to connect Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains, enabling seamless delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies. News of the collaboration ignited significant interest in Avalanche, boosting bullish price predictions for AVAX’s price. Since the beginning of April, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen its bears in control, recording a 5% decline in its altcoin price. However, with this recent collaboration, market analysts anticipate a price recovery in the coming weeks. Filecoin rebounds after ATH dip: Swan Chain integration fuels price surge Like Avalanche (AVAX), Filecoin (FIL) has been quite volatile for the past few weeks. In March, Filecoin dropped for the year’s ATH, plummeting by over 20%. However, the altcoin made a 12% price recovery recently, fueled by the network’s integration with Swan Chain, a Layer 2 network compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Filecoin’s integration with Swan Chain not only enhances storage capabilities but also offers users the ability to seamlessly integrate decentralized computing, bandwidth, and payments within a single suite. The integration has generated enthusiasm within the crypto community, reflecting positively on FIL’s price. As Filecoin’s utility expands through innovative integrations like Swan Chain, analysts predict continued growth and price appreciation for FIL in the coming weeks.

Irene Gao, VP of Mining at Bitmain, highlighted in her announcement how the Antminer S21 Pro has a hash rate of 234 TH/s and an energy efficiency ratio of 15.0 J/TH. In contrast, the Antminer S21 has a hash rate of 200 TH/s and a power consumption efficiency ratio of 17.5 J/TH. Gao also highlighted how durable the S21 Pro is. \"It has the ability to deal with more challenging environments,\" she said, before sharing that the device can withstand temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). The after coupon U.S. dollar to terahash rate for the device is $18.9/TH and Bitmain will begin shipping the device in Q3 2024. This announcement comes just seven months after Bitmain launched the S21. The S21 was quickly adopted by Bitcoin miners, as it has already sold out via the company's website. Bitmain no longer has Antminer S21 mining devices in stock. \"We truly believe this new product will be helpful for you to make your long-term plans for your mining expansion, especially before the new cycle,\" added Gao. For more information on the Antminer S21 Pro, keep an eye out for updates on Bitmain's website.","category":["News","Bitmain","Antminer","Bitcoin Miner","Mining","Bitcoin Miners","Business"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"661c7109dcef7a2f9fc9e1e7","guid":"\n                https://Blockchain.News/news/judge-dismisses-antitrust-suit-against-apple-over-apple-cash\n            ","article_link":"https://Blockchain.News/news/judge-dismisses-antitrust-suit-against-apple-over-apple-cash","website_source":"blockchain.news","article_title":"Judge Dismisses Antitrust Suit Against Apple Over Apple Cash","author":"blockchain.news","creation_date":"2024-03-28T21:56:38Z","thumbnail_image":"https://image.blockchain.news:443/features/96CF1AF594C565EDB60DE2C3040362615010B44A3651210C11A32B3E808A717B.jpg","article_summary":"US District Judge has dismissed an antitrust lawsuit targeting Apple, where Venmo and Cash App users claimed Apple Cash had an anti-competitive edge.

Announced today (Friday), the renewal will extend the partnership between the two for the 2024 season. Axi Sees Value in Football Deals The forex and contracts for differences (CFDs) broker first secured its sponsorship deal with the Brazilian football club in May last year. Under the agreement, the broker has gained the status of an Official Online Trading Partner of the football club, a standard title for such sports deals. Additionally, the Axi branding appears on several physical and digital infrastructures of the football club. However, neither the broker nor the football club disclosed the financial details of the deal. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Esporte Clube Bahia (@ecbahia) “We are very excited about this renewal, which has been in development for some time,” said Hanah Hill, Axi’s Head of Brand and Sponsorship. “When we initiated this collaboration in 2023, we had no idea how receptive the Bahia fans would be. As we move forward into a new season, our commitment to bringing the worlds of trading and football closer together remains unchanged.” A Top Brazilian Football Club Esporte Clube Bahia, founded in 1991 in the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, plays in the top domestic league, Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. The club's home stadium, Arena Fonte Nova, has a capacity of about 48,000. The club also has a substantial reach on social media, with 1.5 million followers on Instagram, 1.6 million followers on X (formerly Twitter), and 1.1 million followers on Facebook.

Additionally, the Aussie broker's focus on sports marketing channels became highlighted when it secured a third sports deal with the Spanish football club Girona FC. “Helping our traders and clients unlock their trading potential is fundamental to us, and through our collaboration with Bahia, we hope to continue growing awareness in the LATAM region, while continuing to offer unforgettable football moments to our traders and partners,” added Hill. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency CFDs trading volume on Axi reached $16.7 billion in March, a 60 percent increase from the previous month, Finance Magnates reported exclusively. The demand soared as about 25 percent of the broker’s active client base traded crypto CFDs last month.

The appointments of Jorn Lambert, Raj Seshadri, and Craig Vosburg to newly defined C-suite roles highlight Mastercard's focus on three key areas: core payments, commercial expansion, and data-driven services. This strategic realignment could position Mastercard to compete more effectively in a rapidly evolving payments industry. Doubling Down on Core Payments: Jorn Lambert's move to Chief Product Officer signifies the continued importance of Mastercard's traditional business – facilitating secure and efficient card transactions. This focus ensures they stay competitive against rivals like Visa and emerging players in the global payments network. Expanding the Commercial Landscape: Raj Seshadri's appointment as Chief Commercial Payments Officer reflects Mastercard's ambition to broaden its reach beyond consumer credit cards. By placing a dedicated leader in charge of B2B payments, bill payments, and remittances, Mastercard signals its intent to capture a larger share of the commercial payments market. This focus on business-to-business transactions could be a significant growth driver in the coming years. Data and AI Take Center Stage: The creation of a new data and AI organization under Craig Vosburg, the Chief Services Officer, is a strong indicator of Mastercard's strategic direction. By placing data and AI at the heart of its service offerings, Mastercard is well-positioned to leverage its vast transaction data to provide valuable insights and solutions for its partners and customers. This focus on data-driven services could unlock new revenue streams and differentiate Mastercard in a crowded marketplace. Mastercard's Long Game: CEO Michael Miebach's comments about \"long-term growth\" and \"diversifying revenue streams\" suggest Mastercard is playing the long game. The leadership changes and corporate restructuring aim to position the company for sustained success in a dynamic financial environment. Whether this strategic shift proves successful remains to be seen, but Mastercard's focus on core payments, commercial expansion, and data-driven services provides a clear roadmap for the future. Open Questions: While the realignment appears well-defined, some questions remain. How will Mastercard balance its traditional focus on consumer payments with its push into the commercial space? Can the company successfully integrate data and AI into its services to create real value for its customers? The answers to these questions will ultimately determine the success of Mastercard's strategic vision. One thing is certain: Mastercard is making a bold move.

The country’s financial market regulator successfully obtained a court order to appoint receivers for the digital currency assets held by a group of three crypto mining companies, collectively known as NGS Companies, and their sole directors. Bust of a Crypto Investment Scheme The court order, issued on Wednesday, was part of the civil proceedings initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) against NGS Crypto Pty Ltd, NGS Digital Pty Ltd, and NGS Group Ltd, along with their respective sole directors Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown, and Mark Ten Caten. Additionally, the court has restricted Mendham from traveling outside Australia. NGS Companies offered investment packages supported by their cryptocurrency mining activities. These packages guaranteed fixed-rate returns as high as 16 percent annually, according to the company's website, with a minimum fixed return promised at 6 percent. The regulator highlighted that the schemes particularly encouraged investors to transfer funds from regulated superannuation funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs), which were then converted into cryptocurrency. The promotional material on the company’s website, including “testimonials” and “stories,” seemed to specifically target elderly investors. Regulator Gets Wary ASIC's action was prompted by concerns that the invested funds in these cryptocurrency schemes were at risk of dissipation. Notably, none of the three implicated companies possessed the necessary financial services licenses to operate legally in Australia. ASIC is now holding them accountable for illegally marketing crypto mining-backed investment products. “Australians who choose to self-manage their superannuation should carefully consider the risks before using their SMSF to invest in crypto-related investment products such as blockchain mining,” advised Joe Longo, the Chair of ASIC. “These proceedings should also serve as a warning to the crypto industry that ASIC will continue to scrutinize products to ensure compliance with regulatory obligations and to protect consumers.” Earlier this year, the Australian regulator dismantled similar crypto-backed schemes that promised astronomical profits and banned a director of a crypto fund for dishonest operations.

forget cash. In the heart of India's digital payment revolution, a battleground is emerging – the war of the wallets. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent decision to allow third-party UPI apps to access prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) has ignited a firestorm of potential, and the fight for customer loyalty is about to get fierce. This isn't your typical corporate clash. The combatants here are a diverse bunch – established giants like Paytm, scrappy fintech startups, and even brick-and-mortar retailers with their own loyalty programs. Until now, PPIs operated in closed gardens, forcing users to stick to the app provided by the issuer. This fragmented landscape stifled competition and limited the reach of digital payments, especially for smaller transactions. The RBI's move dismantles these walls, throwing the doors wide open for innovation. It's much like your local coffee shop's loyalty card morphing into your go-to payment method for online shopping. Or a small business owner seamlessly integrating their existing PPI system with a user-friendly UPI app, attracting a wider customer base. Suddenly, the possibilities for seamless and convenient digital payments explode. This isn't just about convenience, it's about power. The dominance of giants like Paytm, with its staggering $19.1 billion GMV in FY23, is under threat. Smaller players now have a fighting chance, offering unique features and experiences to woo users. Competition breeds choice, and consumers stand to benefit with a wider array of options and potentially lower fees. But the real prize lies in financial inclusion. By removing the restriction to a single app, the RBI is making digital payments more accessible for millions. Small businesses, often reliant on cash transactions, can now tap into the digital ecosystem with ease. Individuals new to the digital realm no longer face the hurdle of navigating a specific PPI issuer's app. This inclusivity can be a game-changer, driving financial empowerment and propelling India's ambition to become a digital payments powerhouse. However, the war won't be won without casualties. Security concerns need to be addressed to ensure a safe environment for transactions across different platforms. User experience will also be a battleground – clunky interfaces and a lack of interoperability can quickly turn customers away. The RBI's decision is a bold move, but the true test lies in execution. Can India create a robust infrastructure that fosters healthy competition while prioritizing security and user experience? The answer will determine the victor in the war of the wallets, but the ultimate winner will be India itself, paving the way for a future where digital payments become the norm, not the exception. This disruption has the potential to not just reshape India's financial landscape, but act as a blueprint for other developing economies looking to embrace the future of money. The war drums are beating, and the world is watching. The Great Wallet War has just begun.

For retail and institutional investors alike, questions of regulatory and tax compliance can be puzzling. Then, there’s the challenge of learning to navigate a new ecosystem. Using exchanges, sending transactions, and taking custody of coins can take significant time to learn. Fortunately, there are ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin without purchasing and holding the asset itself. This can be done in a standard brokerage or retirement account. This article will explore the avenues available for tapping into the Bitcoin market in this way, including exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), public companies with Bitcoin holdings, and mining companies. Bitcoin ETFs: A Gateway to Cryptocurrency Markets ETFs in general have become a popular vehicle for investors looking to diversify their portfolios without directly purchasing the underlying assets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated framework, and have been very successful since their initial launch in the US on January 10, 2024. The first gold ETF took 2 years to reach $10 billion in AUM. Blackrock’s IBIT accomplished the same in just 2 months. Investors track the price of Bitcoin and trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing liquidity and accessibility to investors who may not otherwise be able to access cryptocurrency markets or don’t want to hold Bitcoin itself. Some of the most dominant spot ETFs in the US include BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and ARK’s 21 Bitcoin Shares. Here are some important things to think about when it comes to selecting a spot Bitcoin ETF: Custodian: How does the issuer store their coins? All the ETFs use Coinbase as their custodians, with a few exceptions: Fidelity secures their own Bitcoin internally, VanEck uses BitGo rather than Coinbase, Hashdex selected BitGo as its custodian. Fees: What expense ratio does the fund charge? BitWise has garnered attention for having the lowest fee at just twenty basis points. On the other end of the spectrum, Grayscale charges 1.5%. Transparency: How much do you value transparency when it comes to your funds’ holdings? So far, BitWise is the only fund that has published the public key to its wallet, allowing anyone to view the blockchain transactions that prove the fund holds what it claims to. Fidelity stands out, as being a veteran in the digital asset space that allows them to self-custody their Bitcoin holdings. BitWise shines for its low fees and transparency. Some investors see these funds as preferable. Others may opt for the reputation of firms like BlackRock or ARK. Public Companies with Bitcoin Holdings: Investing in Corporate Believers A number of forward-thinking public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, recognizing its potential as a store of value. By investing in these companies, investors indirectly gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements. This approach allows investors to benefit from the company's broader business performance while aligning with their innovative stance on Bitcoin. MicroStrategy (MSTR) was the first and still is the most well-known company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company currently holds over 1% of the entire supply of BTC. Shares of MSTR have also seen impressive appreciation in recent years, even outperforming Bitcoin at times. Here is a partial list of other companies that have decided to put Bitcoin on their balance sheets: Coinbase Galaxy Digital Holdings Marathon Digital Holdings Block Tesla In addition to companies that hold Bitcoin, mining stocks can also provide BTC exposure.

Investing in these companies represents an investment in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin network. As the demand for Bitcoin grows, these companies may see increased profitability, making them an attractive option for investors looking to get involved in the cryptocurrency space. The recent rise in Bitcoin’s price has been accompanied by an increase in the network’s hash rate, as miners can create profitable operations with greater ease. Many mining companies hold some of the Bitcoin they mine on their balance sheets, making them a way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and its infrastructure. A few popular Bitcoin mining stocks in 2024 include: Hut8 Riot Blockchain Hive Blockchain Bitfarms Limited Cipher Mining CleanSpark CRYPTO BREAKING NEWSThe Bitcoin ETFs Help Money Flow Into Smaller Projects And Their ICOs.

For example, mining stocks can be very volatile, even more so than Bitcoin. Yet they can outperform Bitcoin by a significant margin at times. Such securities require the highest risk tolerance and greatest conviction in the promise of Bitcoin. They can be thought of as a speculative play on Bitcoin, which may be too speculative for some. Public companies that hold Bitcoin provide a blend of exposure to the company’s operations and their Bitcoin holdings. In general, the larger the Bitcoin holdings, the more the share price tends to be correlated to the Bitcoin price. These can be a great choice for more traditional investors who feel safer holding equities with earnings, cashflows, dividends, etc. The downside is they may underperform the other securities available. Bitcoin ETFs represent the purest Bitcoin exposure that a brokerage account can have. There’s not much to be said here, as these shares represent ownership of a portion of the fund’s BTC holdings. There has even been talk of ETFs eventually allowing shares to be redeemed for spot Bitcoin, although this is unlikely in the USA, as the SEC has required ETFs to be settled in cash only. The drawback is that each ETF issuer charges fees, which can eat into profits over time. When considering exposure to Bitcoin through your brokerage account, it's important to evaluate your investment goals and risk tolerance. Bitcoin and related investments can be volatile, and a strategic approach should involve due diligence and a clear understanding of the underlying market dynamics.

The online frontier, however, seems content with pronouncements, leaving the digital equivalent of tumbleweeds – authorized push payment (APP) fraud – to roll unchecked. Until now. New regulations in the UK aim to be the posse riding into town, but will they be enough to truly corral this cyber cattle rustle? APP fraud thrives on a simple deception: tricking victims into authorizing payments to fraudsters. It's a confidence trick for the digital age, and just like their historical counterparts, these online swindlers prey on trust and exploit vulnerabilities. The fallout, however, transcends the individual. It erodes confidence in the very systems that underpin our digital interactions. The UK's new regulations are a response to this erosion. Previously, a voluntary code offered some protection, but it was akin to a town marshal with a single-shot derringer – limited in scope and effectiveness. The new rules, coming into effect this October, are a legislative six-shooter. They mandate reimbursement for victims of APP fraud, placing the onus on payment service providers (PSPs) to act as digital sheriffs, responsible for identifying and stopping the heist before it happens, or reimbursing the victim if they fail. This shift in responsibility is significant. Previously, the onus often fell on the victim to prove they weren't somehow complicit in their own defrauding, much like in a Wild West scenario where the bank, upon discovering a stolen sack of gold, demanded the depositor explain why they weren't more vigilant in guarding it. The new regulations dismantle this skewed logic. They recognize the inherent power imbalance between a sophisticated fraudster and an unsuspecting victim navigating the complexities of online transactions. The success of these regulations hinges on two key factors: robust fraud detection by PSPs and a clear definition of \"consumer standard of caution.\" The former demands a proactive approach from PSPs. Gone are the days of reactive measures – deploying technology and human expertise to identify and flag suspicious transactions before the money leaves the victim's account. The latter, the \"consumer standard of caution,\" is a delicate dance. It must be stringent enough to deter negligence while remaining flexible enough to acknowledge the realities of human fallibility, particularly when dealing with vulnerable customers. The UK's approach isn't a silver bullet. Just as the Wild West still had its share of outlaws after the sheriffs arrived, online fraudsters will undoubtedly adapt their tactics. However, these regulations represent a critical step forward. They move the conversation from victim-blaming to proactive security. They incentivize PSPs to invest in robust defenses, ultimately fostering a more secure online ecosystem for everyone. This isn't just a UK story. The rise of APP fraud is a global phenomenon. The UK's approach serves as a test case, a potential model for other countries grappling with the same issue. Will it be enough? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: the digital frontier demands a new kind of law enforcement, one that understands the complexities of online deception and is equipped to protect citizens in this new virtual landscape.

They mandate reimbursement for victims of APP fraud, placing the onus on payment service providers (PSPs) to act as digital sheriffs, responsible for identifying and stopping the heist before it happens, or reimbursing the victim if they fail. This shift in responsibility is significant. Previously, the onus often fell on the victim to prove they weren't somehow complicit in their own defrauding, much like in a Wild West scenario where the bank, upon discovering a stolen sack of gold, demanded the depositor explain why they weren't more vigilant in guarding it. The new regulations dismantle this skewed logic. They recognize the inherent power imbalance between a sophisticated fraudster and an unsuspecting victim navigating the complexities of online transactions. The success of these regulations hinges on two key factors: robust fraud detection by PSPs and a clear definition of \"consumer standard of caution.\" The former demands a proactive approach from PSPs. Gone are the days of reactive measures – deploying technology and human expertise to identify and flag suspicious transactions before the money leaves the victim's account. The latter, the \"consumer standard of caution,\" is a delicate dance. It must be stringent enough to deter negligence while remaining flexible enough to acknowledge the realities of human fallibility, particularly when dealing with vulnerable customers. The UK's approach isn't a silver bullet. Just as the Wild West still had its share of outlaws after the sheriffs arrived, online fraudsters will undoubtedly adapt their tactics. However, these regulations represent a critical step forward. They move the conversation from victim-blaming to proactive security. They incentivize PSPs to invest in robust defenses, ultimately fostering a more secure online ecosystem for everyone. This isn't just a UK story. The rise of APP fraud is a global phenomenon. The UK's approach serves as a test case, a potential model for other countries grappling with the same issue. Will it be enough? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: the digital frontier demands a new kind of law enforcement, one that understands the complexities of online deception and is equipped to protect citizens in this new virtual landscape.

But new on-ramps are emerging and Open Banking, a seemingly uncharted road, is promising a more direct and potentially more efficient journey. Open Banking, much like a high-speed rail system bypassing congested tollbooths, facilitates Account-to-Account (A2A) payments. Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position. Here, only 13% see cards holding sway, while 54% predict A2A or mobile money taking the lead. Existing examples like Brazil's PIX, which surpassed credit and debit card market share in 2023, showcase this trend's potency. The Global North presents a more nuanced picture. Here, expert opinions are divided between cards and the A2A/mobile money combination. While A2A payments have gained traction in Europe (Poland's Blik, Netherlands' IDEAL, Sweden's Swish), some experts believe cards will retain dominance. However, a third of jurors foresee ongoing competition with no clear winner. The Driving Forces: Several factors are fueling the rise of A2A payments: Open Banking: Open Banking regulations allow third-party providers to access customer financial data with consent, facilitating A2A transactions. Instant Payments: The rise of instant payment networks enables faster and more efficient A2A transfers. Strong Authentication: Improved authentication methods enhance security and consumer trust in A2A transactions. Potential Benefits: Lower Transaction Costs: A2A payments generally involve lower fees compared to card transactions, potentially benefiting both businesses and consumers. Improved Customer Journeys: Streamlined checkout processes and in-app payments can enhance the customer experience. Greater Consumer Choice: A2A payments offer consumers an alternative to traditional payment methods, fostering competition and innovation. Industry Response: The rise of A2A has spurred action from key players. Even in North America, where cards reign supreme, companies are taking notice. McKinsey highlights the potential for A2A to offer banks a \"more competitive way of making payments\" while providing consumers and merchants with more options. Visa and Mastercard are investing in A2A plays, and TrueLayer's new A2A payments app allows merchants to integrate A2A options into their checkout processes. Conclusion: Open Banking and A2A payments represent a significant shift in the global payments landscape. While the pace of adoption may differ across regions, the potential for A2A to become a mainstream payment method is undeniable. As the technology matures and consumer trust grows, A2A payments have the potential to revolutionize the way we pay, fostering a more transparent, efficient, and rewarding financial ecosystem. Yet, the revolution faces a more significant obstacle: the inertia of established infrastructure. Change, particularly when it involves money, is often met with resistance. Drivers, accustomed to the ease of swiping plastic, may be hesitant to navigate a new and potentially unfamiliar road system as it would be like asking drivers to switch from their favorite, well-lit highway to a less-traveled backroad – a more direct route, perhaps, but lacking the familiar rest stops and roadside attractions. The battle for the future of payments in America is not a race to a single destination, but a reimagining of the entire transportation network. Consumers, enticed by the promise of a more personalized and potentially cheaper experience, could become the loyal riders. But the established card networks, the seasoned highway authorities of the financial landscape, will not relinquish their control easily. They will unleash their marketing campaigns, wielding the glittering lure of rewards points as a well-advertised scenic byway. The outcome of this digital revolution remains unwritten. Will Open Banking and A2A payments become the preferred route for American consumers, ushering in an era of financial transparency and lower costs? Or will the inertia of the status quo and the allure of plastic's rewards prevail? Only one thing is certain: consumers are holding the steering wheel. Will they remain content with the familiar highway, or will they embrace the new on-ramp and become active participants in a financial revolution? Only time will tell who will reach their destination first in this high-stakes race for payment supremacy.

Consumers can transfer funds directly from their bank accounts to a merchant's account, bypassing the card networks and their associated fees. This holds the potential for a smoother ride for both merchants, who can potentially reduce their transaction costs, and consumers, who may benefit from lower prices or special A2A-only discounts. However, the American consumer, comfortable in their high-occupancy vehicles (credit cards) and accustomed to the familiar rewards program exits, may not be easily persuaded to switch lanes. Insights from the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024: Sponsored by the World Bank and other key players, the Worldpay Global Payments Report 2024 highlights the growing popularity of A2A payments. Back in 2022, only half of the jury members predicted A2A networks and mobile money would compete with cards within five years. However, just two years later, the picture has changed dramatically. Over two-thirds of jurors now believe A2A and mobile money will be the fastest-growing retail payment methods in their home markets. This trend is particularly pronounced in the Global South (Africa, Middle East, South America, Asia Pacific), where card networks haven't established a dominant position. Here, only 13% see cards holding sway, while 54% predict A2A or mobile money taking the lead. Existing examples like Brazil's PIX, which surpassed credit and debit card market share in 2023, showcase this trend's potency. The Global North presents a more nuanced picture. Here, expert opinions are divided between cards and the A2A/mobile money combination. While A2A payments have gained traction in Europe (Poland's Blik, Netherlands' IDEAL, Sweden's Swish), some experts believe cards will retain dominance. However, a third of jurors foresee ongoing competition with no clear winner. The Driving Forces: Several factors are fueling the rise of A2A payments: Open Banking: Open Banking regulations allow third-party providers to access customer financial data with consent, facilitating A2A transactions. Instant Payments: The rise of instant payment networks enables faster and more efficient A2A transfers. Strong Authentication: Improved authentication methods enhance security and consumer trust in A2A transactions. Potential Benefits: Lower Transaction Costs: A2A payments generally involve lower fees compared to card transactions, potentially benefiting both businesses and consumers. Improved Customer Journeys: Streamlined checkout processes and in-app payments can enhance the customer experience. Greater Consumer Choice: A2A payments offer consumers an alternative to traditional payment methods, fostering competition and innovation. Industry Response: The rise of A2A has spurred action from key players. Even in North America, where cards reign supreme, companies are taking notice. McKinsey highlights the potential for A2A to offer banks a \"more competitive way of making payments\" while providing consumers and merchants with more options. Visa and Mastercard are investing in A2A plays, and TrueLayer's new A2A payments app allows merchants to integrate A2A options into their checkout processes. Conclusion: Open Banking and A2A payments represent a significant shift in the global payments landscape. While the pace of adoption may differ across regions, the potential for A2A to become a mainstream payment method is undeniable. As the technology matures and consumer trust grows, A2A payments have the potential to revolutionize the way we pay, fostering a more transparent, efficient, and rewarding financial ecosystem. Yet, the revolution faces a more significant obstacle: the inertia of established infrastructure. Change, particularly when it involves money, is often met with resistance. Drivers, accustomed to the ease of swiping plastic, may be hesitant to navigate a new and potentially unfamiliar road system as it would be like asking drivers to switch from their favorite, well-lit highway to a less-traveled backroad – a more direct route, perhaps, but lacking the familiar rest stops and roadside attractions. The battle for the future of payments in America is not a race to a single destination, but a reimagining of the entire transportation network. Consumers, enticed by the promise of a more personalized and potentially cheaper experience, could become the loyal riders. But the established card networks, the seasoned highway authorities of the financial landscape, will not relinquish their control easily. They will unleash their marketing campaigns, wielding the glittering lure of rewards points as a well-advertised scenic byway. The outcome of this digital revolution remains unwritten. Will Open Banking and A2A payments become the preferred route for American consumers, ushering in an era of financial transparency and lower costs? Or will the inertia of the status quo and the allure of plastic's rewards prevail? Only one thing is certain: consumers are holding the steering wheel. Will they remain content with the familiar highway, or will they embrace the new on-ramp and become active participants in a financial revolution? Only time will tell who will reach their destination first in this high-stakes race for payment supremacy.

The scene was set by the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV as Scholz, accompanied by a delegation of ministers and business executives, began his strategic trip aimed at strengthening economic bonds with Berlin’s largest trading partner. As tensions simmer between Western nations and Beijing, Scholz told us that Germany is not backing down from its economic engagements with China, the globe’s number two economy. This resolve comes amidst loud calls for “decoupling” led by the US, which Scholz outright rejects. The Chancellor’s willingness to extend an olive branch to China could, however, stir discontent among allies like the US and the EU, who are increasingly wary of China’s substantial subsidies to its industries. “China remains a really important economic partner,” Scholz confidently told journalists just before his departure, emphasizing his commitment to level the playing field for German companies operating in China. Beyond trade and economics, Scholz’s visit carries weighty geopolitical implications. His agenda includes talks aimed at persuading Chinese President Xi Jinping to leverage his relationship with Russia, urging a de-escalation of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. “Given the close relations between China and Russia, Beijing has the possibility to exert its influence on Russia,” a source from the German government noted. This tour, spanning Chongqing, Shanghai, and Beijing, is Scholz’s second visit to China since assuming office. His inaugural visit in November 2022 faced intense scrutiny shortly after Xi Jinping had solidified his political power, heralding the first post-pandemic visit by a G7 leader to China. Back then, the Western world, reeling from supply chain disruptions amid the health crisis and China’s staunch support of Russia post-Ukraine invasion, was prompted to reconsider its dependency on Chinese markets and production capabilities. Meanwhile, back home, the German economy showed early signs of resilience this year, as evidenced by the recent data releases. February witnessed a 2.1-percent increase in overall output, exceeding expectations and building on January’s 1.3-percent rise. This growth was aided by dry weather boosting the construction sector by 7.9 percent, and reduced energy costs spurring the car manufacturing and chemicals sectors to grow by 5.7 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. However, despite these gains, things remain bleak. Germany’s total production was still down by 4.9 percent compared to the previous year and nearly 8 percent from its pre-pandemic levels. With exports to China declining, last year saw the German economy contract by 0.3 percent, making it the poorest performer among major developed nations. An analysis by the Netherlands financial services group ING remarked, “as much as today’s industrial data is a balm for the German economic soul, this is not yet the start of a remarkable recovery.” They noted that anticipated cuts to interest rates by the European Central Bank, alongside lower gas and electricity prices and the resilience of the US economy, might offer some relief to German industries in the upcoming months. Yet, global issues and structural challenges like the green transition are expected to persist. A report from Euronews, referencing analysis by Germany’s top research institutes, described the economy as “ailing” with a continued pessimistic outlook, indicating overlapping economic and structural factors stifling overall growth. Siemens CFO Ralf Thomas summed up the long-term challenge facing German manufacturers in reducing their dependence on China. “Global value chains have been building up over the last 50 years. How naive do you need to be to believe that this can be changed within six or 12 months?” he remarked in an interview with the Financial Times, emphasizing that realigning these chains is a decades-long endeavor. With China as Germany’s top trading partner, involving major companies like Volkswagen and BASF as well as smaller entities, the economic ties run deep. “We cannot afford not to be [in China],” Thomas declared, acknowledging the challenge posed by rising local competitors and adding, “if you can stand the heat of the Chinese kitchen, you are successful in other places as well.”","category":["Economy","News","China","Germany economy"],"_type":"article"},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c43","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=315144","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/optimism-price-prediction/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"Optimism Price Prediction 2024–2033: Will OP Token Gain Momentum?","author":"Joel Oluwatobi","creation_date":"2024-04-18T15:30:30Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Optimism.jpg","article_summary":"Optimism Price Prediction 2024-2033 Imagine a world where Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is not just a giant because of its support for smart contracts, but also a fast, affordable, and efficient platform.

This is the world that the Ethereum community dreams of, a world where decentralized apps (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms thrive without the burden of high transaction fees. But alas, this dream is yet to be realized. Enter Optimism, a shining knight in the world of Ethereum, here to rescue us from the dragon of slow and costly transactions. This layer-2 scaling solution, powered by the innovative technology of Optimistic rollups, is like a super-efficient postman who bundles large amounts of transaction data into manageable parcels, delivering them swiftly and affordably. Optimism is not just a solution, it’s a revolution. It’s cheaper, faster, and is gaining popularity faster than a viral dance challenge on social media. It stands tall among other layer 2 solutions, like Arbitrum, and is becoming a favorite among the Ethereum community. But what’s a revolution without its own currency? The Optimism network is governed by its very own token, charmingly named OP. In a move that caused quite a stir, a chunk of OP tokens was generously airdropped to early Optimism users in late May 2022. And the best part? The developers behind Optimism have promised to continue this airdrop, making it rain OP tokens for its users. So, while we wait for Ethereum to roll out its planned upgrades, Optimism is here, making Ethereum transactions faster, cheaper, and well-optimized! How Much is Optimism Worth? The live Optimism price today is $2.25 with a 24-hour trading volume of $224,964,438 USD. We update our OP to USD price in real-time. Optimism is up by 5.87% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #41, with a live market cap of $3,112,569,206 USD. It has a circulating supply of 1,006,141,600 OP coins and a max. supply of 4,294,967,296 OP coins. Optimism Price Analysis: OP Climbs Higher At $2.25 Following Bullish Action TL: DR Breakdown Optimism price analysis shows a bullish bias trend OP support is found at $2.09 Resistance for OP is present at $2.27 Optimism price analysis indicates a bullish signal today as the price rises to the $2.25 mark and is up 5.87 percent for the past 24 hours. OP coin is trading at $2.25 after hitting an intra-day high of $2.27. The short-term technical chart shows that Optimism is in a bullish trend and is likely to rally further. The overall market sentiment is bullish, as the OP price has sustained the $2.00 level for several days now. Optimism Price Analysis 1-day Chart: Bullish Momentum Propels OP Prices Toward The $2.25 Level The 1-day Optimism price analysis suggests that a break of resistance at the current levels will confirm an uptrend, opening up for a retest of the $2.17 high today. If this level breaks, a further advance of $3.00 is expected. The price action in the 1-day chart suggests that the price may be forming a triangle pattern, which is generally considered to be a bullish sign. The coin is now supported by strong buying pressure and has further surged to a new all-time high of $2.25, indicating that the buyers are still in control. OP/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The EMA is also in a positive trajectory after crossing the 20-day EMA, which indicates that the bulls are in control. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 32.69, indicating that the market is in oversold territory. This suggests that a bottom may be nearing, and a reversal could take place in the near future. OP/USD 4-Hour Price Chart: Latest Development. The hourly chart for OP/USD has formed an ascending triangle pattern on the 24-hour chart, which indicates that the buyers have taken control of the market and are likely to push the coin toward higher levels. The short-term outlook for Optimism remains bullish as the coin is trading above its crucial support level of $2.09. The buyers should continue to remain cautious and keep an eye on the $2.27 resistance level as any failure to break it could lead to a sell-off in the near term. OP/USD 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) score is increasing at a faster pace and has reached an index of 47.48, which indicates that the market is currently in a bullish state. The exponential moving averages (EMA) in the higher time frames, such as the 4-hour chart, suggest that the price action is highly bullish and is likely to sustain gains above $3.00 in the near term. What to Expect From Optimism Price Analysis Next? Optimism price analysis is well-positioned for further gains in the near term, and investors may use this as an opportunity to enter the market at current levels. Bulls need to break above the $2.27 level of resistance to sustain their momentum and reach new highs. On the downside, a breach below $2.09 could indicate a bearish trend and push prices lower in the near term. Investors need to keep an eye on these critical levels for further price movements in the OP coin. Is optimism a good investment? Optimism (OP) has shown a notable performance over the past week, appreciating by 4.05% in value, triggered by strategic partnerships and a significant airdrop. The collaboration with Velodrome and Chaos Labs to promote the adoption of Circle’s USDC stablecoin on the Optimism mainnet initiated a surge in OP’s price. This momentum was further boosted by an airdrop of over 10 million OP tokens to more than 22,000 unique addresses, leading to a peak price of $4.15. Despite this positive trend, experts anticipate a correction in OP’s price towards the end of February, predicting a stabilization around $3.92 as the excitement from the recent airdrop fades. This short-term prediction suggests a cautious approach to investing in OP at this moment, highlighting the volatility and speculative nature of the crypto market.

While it’s important to remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, understanding the token’s trading history can provide a useful context for interpreting or making an Optimism price prediction. image 259 When the OP token was first introduced to the open market via the initial airdrop on May 31, 2022, it was valued at $4.57, as per CoinMarketCap. However, this price seemed overly optimistic as the market quickly deemed it overvalued, causing it to drop to a low of $0.7973 before ending the day at $1.44 – a 68.5% decrease from the opening price. Despite the initial price being the all-time high for Optimism, the OP token price has seen some fluctuations. In June 2022, the market was still recovering from the depegging of the UST stablecoin and the subsequent collapse of the associated LUNA cryptocurrency. This was quickly followed by the Celsius crypto lending platform freezing withdrawals, further confirming the bear market. This series of events negatively impacted the newly launched Optimism, causing it to drop to its all-time low of $0.4005 on June 18, 2022 – less than a tenth of its launch price. However, the token made a slow recovery, ending the month at $0.5434. But by July 13, 2022, the token fell to $0.4147, continuing its bearish trend. Following Ethereum’s Merge – the transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism aimed at making the blockchain faster and more eco-friendly – on September 15, 2022, the crypto markets didn’t react as positively as many investors had hoped. Despite launching on OpenSea, Optimism was trading at $0.8917 on September 28. The OP token continued to fall, reaching $0.649 by October 21. However, by November 4, 2022, the token had regained over 108% and surged to $1.3512 following the launch of Pragmatism, a library design system created by Figma for the Optimism Collective. This bullish run was short-lived, though, as the token fell to $0.7952 by November 10, 2022, triggered by the collapse of the FTX (FTT) exchange. Throughout the rest of November, the token fluctuated between $1 and $0.8 before starting a steady rise in December, spurred by Optimism’s announcement of the deployment of the AttestationStation, an attestation smart contract providing “a permissionless, accessible data source for builders creating reputation-based applications”. On December 15, 2022, the platform also announced that an Optimism non-fungible token (NFT) would be “coming soon” on the AttestationStation, serving as a “customisable profile picture that can represent user identity across the Optimism Ecosystem”. Earlier, the platform had announced Retroactive Public Goods Funding Round 2, set to launch in February 2023, aimed at giving back to those “powering the public goods that make Optimism possible”. The first half of December saw OP rising, reaching a high of $1.19 before dropping to close the year at $0.9172. OP then experienced a rally at the start of the New Year, reaching $3.21 on February 3. A drop was followed by a recovery to $3.26 on February 24, but then it decreased to trade at about $2.52 on March 7, 2023. Optimism further declined and touched the $1.5 mark in early June. More about the Optimism Network What Is Optimism? Optimism operates as a second layer chain, functioning atop the Ethereum mainnet, which is the first layer. Transactions are conducted on Optimism, but the transaction data is relayed to the mainnet for validation. This is akin to driving on a less congested side road while still enjoying the security of a major highway. Lastly, we put proxies in front of our public endpoints in order to dynamically distribute load and eliminate downtime. You can now check the network's status from the new status page: https://t.co/mtXoiaoTDe. — Optimism (@Optimism) January 31, 2022 As per the current data from Defi Llama, Optimism is the second largest Ethereum layer 2, having $313 million locked in its smart contracts. Arbitrum leads the pack with $1.32 billion. Wow, what a day. OP Drop #1 had a turbulent launch which we finally stabilized after more than five hours of non-stop work. We’ll be publishing a full, detailed retrospective on the lessons learned next week. Let’s quickly talk about what happened. — Optimism (@Optimism) June 1, 2022 Synthetix, a protocol providing liquidity for derivatives, holds the position of the largest protocol on Optimism, with a total value locked (TVL) of $125 million. Uniswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX), is the second most utilized protocol on this chain. As of the current data, there are 35 protocols on Optimism, each having at least $1,000 locked in their smart contracts. Optimistic rollups operate on the principle of ‘optimistic’ validation, where all transactions within the rollup are presumed to be valid. This approach saves time as individual transactions aren’t required to provide direct proof of their validity. Validators within the rollup are given a week to scrutinize the entire rollup for any fraudulent data. According to a Dune Analytics dashboard, Optimism remarkably reduces Ethereum transaction fees, also known as gas fees, by an impressive 129 times. It is backed by DeFi platforms such as Synthetix and Uniswap. As of March 2022, Dune Analytics reports that Optimism safeguards approximately $740 million of on-chain value, a decrease from just over $1 billion in January. Optimism was first introduced in June 2019, with a testnet launched in October of the same year. However, it wasn’t until January 2021 that an alpha mainnet was launched. It took until October 2021 for Optimism to release a version of the Alpha mainnet that was compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Finally, an open mainnet was launched in December 2021. How Does Optimism Work? Optimism essentially functions as a large, append-only record of transactions. All of its consolidated blocks are stored in an Ethereum smart contract known as the Canonical Transaction Chain. Unless a user directly submits their transaction to the Canonical Transaction Chain, new blocks are generated by an entity known as a sequencer. This sequencer promptly validates transactions, then constructs and executes blocks on Optimism’s layer 2, a blockchain that resides on top of the layer 1 blockchain, in this case, Ethereum. These blocks, referred to as ‘rollups’, are batches of Ethereum transactions. The sequencer further compresses this data to minimize the transaction size (thereby saving money) and then submits the transaction data back to Ethereum. The layer 2 software of Optimism is engineered to closely resemble Ethereum’s code. For example, it utilizes the same virtual machine as Ethereum and calculates gas charges in a similar manner (though at a reduced rate, courtesy of its optimistic rollup solution). Due to the underlying similarities between Ethereum and Optimism, any ERC-20 asset, which is a cryptocurrency that complies with the generic Ethereum token standard, can be transferred between the two networks. How Do You Use Optimism? For users, the experience of using Optimism closely mirrors that of the Ethereum mainnet. Your Optimism address is identical to your Ethereum mainnet address, starting with 0x. The blockchain explorer of Optimism is also the same as Etherscan, which is the blockchain explorer for the Ethereum mainnet. Optimism is compatible with a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) wallets, including MetaMask, which is the most commonly used option. image 260 To utilize Optimism, you need to deposit your ETH or ERC-20 tokens into the Optimism token bridge. This enables you to carry out transactions on Ethereum via Optimism. Once done, you can convert your tokens back to the Ethereum mainnet. To deposit your tokens, you must do so through the Optimism Gateway. This can be accessed via a Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Deposits typically take around twenty minutes, and for transferring 1 ETH, MetaMask estimated a fee of $18. Optimism indicated that withdrawing the funds would take a week and cost $52.72. This delay is a characteristic of the week-long challenge period incorporated into Optimism’s optimistic rollup. After depositing funds on Optimism, you can utilize them within supported decentralized applications. For example, Uniswap allows you to execute trades via Optimism to save on fees. Simply select Optimism from the network menu, and you can proceed with trading as usual. You also have the option to use a centralized cryptocurrency exchange to deposit ETH into your Optimism address. However, before attempting to transfer funds to a layer 2 from your centralized exchange, always ensure that the exchange supports withdrawals to that particular chain. If you transfer funds to an unsupported address, you risk losing your funds irretrievably. As of the time of this writing, exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and Huobi permit withdrawals to Optimism. What is Optimism’s token (OP)? Optimism introduced its OP token on May 31. A total of 231,000 addresses were eligible to claim 214 million OP tokens for free, a process known as an “airdrop”. This represents 5% of the total supply of 4.29 billion, implying that 95% of the supply is yet to be released into the market. The number of users who claimed the first airdrop can be tracked on this Dune Analytics dashboard. Hey folks–in the interest of transparency, we'd like to share some details about an ongoing situation:https://t.co/915vIgRIJG Summary below 🧵👇 — Optimism (@Optimism) June 8, 2022 The airdrop encountered significant issues. Optimism confessed that they “grossly underestimated the traffic surge that the airdrop would generate,” resulting in many eligible token holders being left without tokens. However, Optimism faced further negative publicity on June 8, when an exploit led to the theft of 20 million OP tokens intended for the liquidity provider Wintermute. According to Optimism, the exploit happened when Wintermute provided an Ethereum L1 address that had not yet been deployed on Optimism. Before the problem could be resolved, an attacker managed to seize the funds. Wintermute accepted full responsibility. Since the hacker only liquidated one million OP tokens, Wintermute speculated that the attack was carried out by a whitehat (ethical) hacker. In a message to the hacker, Wintermute stated: “You have one week to consider being a whitehat. If this doesn’t happen, we are 100% committed to recovering all the funds, identifying the person(s) responsible for the exploit, fully exposing them and handing them over to the appropriate legal system.” Despite the assignment of blame, Optimism received a significant amount of criticism on Twitter. The OP token grants holders the right to participate in The Optimism Collective, a two-tier governance system consisting of the Token House and the Citizens’ House. The Citizens’ House, set to be operational later in 2022, will govern decisions related to public-goods funding. The Token House, which is already active, sees technical decisions related to Optimism, such as software upgrades. In its early stages, Optimism raised funds on Gitcoin, a prominent public-goods funding platform. Arbitrum Vs. Optimism Arbitrum and Optimism, both classified as Optimistic rollups, have notable differences. One key distinction is their dispute-resolution processes for transaction validation. Optimism employs single-round fraud proofs executed on layer-1, while Arbitrum uses multi-round fraud proofs executed off-chain. Arbitrum’s multi-round fraud proofing is more advanced, offering greater cost-effectiveness and efficiency compared to Optimism’s single-round proofing. Additionally, although both platforms are EVM compatible, they differ in their underlying virtual machines. Optimism uses Ethereum’s EVM, whereas Arbitrum operates on its own Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM). Consequently, Optimism supports only the Solidity compiler, while Arbitrum is compatible with all EVM-compiled languages, such as Vyper and Yul. Optimism and Arbitrum diverge in terms of their development roadmaps. Optimism has a clearly outlined roadmap extending until 2024, which includes objectives like introducing advanced interactive fraud proofs, sharded rollups, and a decentralized sequencer. On the other hand, Arbitrum does not publicly disclose its future plans on its website or Github. Conclusion Optimism has rapidly ascended as a favored Ethereum scaling solution. The Optimism Foundation recently put forth a proposal for transitioning the Optimism mainnet to Bedrock, a novel decentralized Rollup architecture devised by Optimism Labs. The team expressed their confidence in the positive impact of the post-Bedrock experience for developers within the Optimism ecosystem and shared the consistent enthusiasm they’ve received from their partners regarding the upgrade. They affirmed their dedication to ensuring the success of this upgrade and are looking forward to observing the outcomes in the forthcoming months and years. The evolving competition between optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups in the upcoming years, as they vie for dominance in layer-two solutions, also presents an intriguing aspect to keep an eye on.","category":["Crypto Price Predictions"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c44","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=513211","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/who-introduces-ai-chatbot-sarah-flaws/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"WHO Introduces AI Chatbot SARAH Despite Flaws","author":"John Palmer","creation_date":"2024-04-18T15:01:40Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_WHO_Introduces_AI_Chatbot_SARAH_Despite_Flaws_0.jpg","article_summary":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has come up with an AI integrated by a chatbot which is named SARAH.

SARAH’s mission is to cover access to information on global health. We mention the innovative approach of SARAH. Nonetheless, it still manages to make some essential false medical information. Technological Innovation Meets Health Education REFLECTING the efforts made by WHO to this cause, SETHARA is an acronym for Smart AI Resource Assistant for Health. She represents the latest digital health means used by the institution. Developed to meet care demands anytime and anywhere, SARAH can deliver information in eight languages, including mental health and life choices. This is one of such actions that form part of WHO’s strategy to on-board technology in public health education and to close the global gap in health coverage. However, WHO admitted the embryo has weaknesses despite that it is the prototype in history. It has been so far commonly tailored by the programmers to remain within WHO’s mandate field and offers information on how to find professional help on particular issues. The bot can’t provide such service continuously and it cannot be compared to tools like WebMD. Challenges in AI Accuracy and Security SARAH has not been done only easy ways from deployment. The AI chatbot is based on the OpenAI’s ChatGPT 3.5 model; it has had problems with serving outdated information as well as some wrong answers. An instance of this is its incorrect mention of the approval status for a new Alzheimer’s drug, a reflection of its lack of ongoing trained data which only included data as far back as September 2021. The other thing that SARAH is often experiencing is presenting the answers that may be outside a topic or purpose, the known problem in the AI development is referencing as hallucinations Summing up, these inaccuracies could raise the danger of public misinformation. The World Health Organization (WHO) is therefore looking at getting the views of researchers and government agencies to improve resilience, especially in human health emergencies. This is also accompanied by apprehensions about the use of AI by the health workforce. SORAH applies facial recognition techniques to detect and deduce the users’ emotions. They promise to avoid showing their faces by providing data protection and privacy. The open-source perpetuity model is also marked by increased exposure to cyber attacks on the foundation of AI. Future directions and ethical considerations WHO is still maintaining the SARAH, and soon updates are to come like the introduction of the changing avatar apparance and interactive abilities. Indeed, WHO announced ethical principles for its stakeholders and put forward the notions of data transparency and user security. SARAH, which is a technology based on artificial intelligence, is taken to another level of its design as WHO is wary about integrating AI in spreading health messages. However, the technology has several weaknesses which the organization promptly points out. The organization makes it transparently clear that SARAH is not a transformer of medical services which is not what was aimed for, but a supportive tool to spread public health awareness and education worldwide. Despite some obstacles, the WHO‘s effort demonstrates significant progress in using artificial intelligence in health education since it will be directed toward a wider range of audience and help health information more available globally.

He’s now set on making new users cough up cash just to tweet, like, bookmark, or even reply. This is him trying to usher in a whole new era for the platform, where access isn’t just about logging in but also paying up. Paywall Incoming for New Users Straight from the horse’s mouth, Musk admitted that X would start charging newbies for what used to be free. The fee, which he did not quantify, is ostensibly to combat bots—an issue he seems fixated on. According to Musk, advancements in AI have made it too easy for bots to bypass traditional security checks, leading to a surge in fake accounts. He seems to think making real humans pay is the solution. Last year, X dabbled with a payment model in New Zealand and the Philippines, charging a nominal annual fee. Based on Musk’s recent comments, this wasn’t just a test run but the beginning of a broader strategy to implement fees globally. Unfortunately, a small fee for new user write access is the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots. Current AI (and troll farms) can pass “are you a bot” with ease. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 15, 2024 Musk’s rationale? He’s tired of bots and fake accounts overrunning the platform. He also mentioned that the fee might be temporary, perhaps just for the first three months after a user signs up—a grace period, if you will, to see if it helps clean up the platform. Controversial Changes and Community Backlash Musk’s tenure has been nothing short of dramatic. Since taking over in late 2022, he’s chopped the workforce, including the team responsible for keeping the platform clean of spam and inappropriate content. This decision, predictably, led to a noticeable increase in spam—exactly the problem he now claims to solve with a fee. Furthermore, anyone can now buy their way into verification on X, granting their posts and replies more visibility. This change, unsurprisingly, hasn’t been received well by all, with some users pointing out that it’s only increased the visibility of spam, rather than curbing it. Musk previously hinted that the fee structure might extend beyond new users to all users. Yes, you heard that right. Everyone might have to pay to tweet if Musk’s plans unfold as hinted. Financially, things haven’t been looking great for X either. Advertisers have been jumping ship, wary of Musk’s hardcore free speech stance and his tolerance for edgier content. This has reportedly led to a sharp decline in revenue—a trend that’s worrying for any platform that relies heavily on ad dollars. Initial reports of these changes appeared on X Daily News, framing the fee as a way to reduce spam and improve user experience. However, Musk’s comments about the necessity of the fee, its potential duration, and its scope leave many questions unanswered. What’s clear is that following accounts and browsing will remain free, which provides little consolation for those upset by the new pay-to-participate model.","category":["Latest News","News","Elon Musk","Twitter"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c46","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=513194","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/helldivers-2-democracy-condemns-terminids/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"Helldivers 2: Democracy Condemns Terminids As its Enemy","author":"Joel Oluwatobi","creation_date":"2024-04-18T14:47:16Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/photo_5839255927700701038_y.jpg","article_summary":"Around a month after the battle with the humanoid robot Automaton, the Helldivers are now focusing on a new objective – the terminator insect of the Terminid army.

Super Earth, the governing body overseeing Helldivers operations, has issued a new Major Order with a staggering objective: wipe out 2 billion Terminids before day six. The Terminid purge begins With Helldivers’ resented democratic ideals, the battle for independence has taken a different approach: the struggle of the Terminids to avoid being caught in the middle. However, the Order’s target of 2 billion casualties might be out of proportion as much has happened in the short time but the Helldivers have succeeded in forging a significant way ahead. Based on statements, Major Order being launched brought along 76,620,418 of the 3.8% total objective within two hours only! This initial achievement is particularly noteworthy when we take into account the fact that there were as little as only 88,000 Helldivers online at that time – a small percentage of the total number of typical 200,000 individual players we can usually witness during the busiest times of the day. A calculated offensive The fact that the Helldivers, due to their excellent combat and strategic planning, are far ahead of the Terminids is a reflection of their combat proficiency and strategies. Despite this, during an escalating offensive, the reason for the optimized loadouts becomes the most important issue. The experts, that is Helldiver veterans, have started to counsel their colleagues on the necessity to contact those professionals who have put together a list of the most efficient guns and amor for the game. “For this, we advise mostly our Helldivers 2 best weapons guide and best armor guide where you will find comprehensive information on how to put together your ideal loadout to annihilate the Terminids,” says the commanding Helldiver officer. A hateful and but inescapable struggle The populace may doubt the significance of this confiscation, but the Helldivers’ ultimate justification comes from the cornerstones of democracy and the stability of the galaxy. The Terminids have been more tolerant now than before, but they have an established track record of aggression and subjugation of other races in their conquest of territory. “‘Helldivers Supermajesty has decided to enact the project to counterbalance the equilibrium of power in the galaxy’,” stated a representative of the organization. ” The Terminids are not only expanding unchecked but also subdue other races prime threat to democracy of liberty we fight for.” An Achievable Hard Target That headquarters, though, hardly causes issues for Earth as the Captain tells the Helldivers to swiftly remove themselves and save the situation in only six days. This opinion was shared by some of the leading politicians who considered that it may not be that hard for some diabetes battlers to survive several skirmishes. “I mean, with over 10 billion terminal to get a taste of your revolution, you must ensure that your shift scouts are well placed within democratic structures,” announced the spokesperson. “Zuper Earth is heading in the right direction. But I don’t think he will be able to come up with something to carry the story if his opponent was non-fighting or non-combatant.” Lastly, the galaxy-ready Demon Hunters, who are dead meat without blood, and the Order Keepers who have their daily ration food pack and people. It however remains a mystery whether the movement of anti-democracy forces will last long and when this movement will give fruits to the causes it has set.","category":["Industry News"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c47","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=513189","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/apple-to-expand-singapore-campus/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"Apple Invests $250 Million to Expand Singapore Campus for AI Work.","author":"John Palmer","creation_date":"2024-04-18T14:27:10Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_Apple_Invests_250_Million_to_Expand_Singapore_Campus_f_0-1.jpg","article_summary":"The announcement by Apple, a tech heavyweight, envisions a big push towards improving its AI capabilities, with $250 million allocated to the enhancement of its Singapore campus.

This represents dynamic growth since Apple, plus its iOS 18 update, intends to merge the existing generative AI capabilities. Expansion plans unveiled Apple, Singapore, Ang Mo Kio campus, which is adding two extra buildings, is due to undergo a restructuring with a new look. The enlargement will occur later and create the groundwork for improved relationships among agents of the rapidly progressing teams in the area. Available financing will allow the campus to start with one building and then add two more. Such enhanced facilities will facilitate expansion into the newest areas of Artificial Intelligence and key functions to supply for this innovation plan. Specializing in generative AI, Apple While iOS 18 is still an unconfirmed title, Apple pushes further by applauding generative artificial intelligence as one of the highlights of its upcoming flagship operating system. This is about to take over the air by offering users opportunities to Siri this kind of sentimental experience. Apple’s CEO, Tin Cook, was excited to be entering the AI sector in Singapore, which he cited as a standalone platform for innovation. He underscored Apple’s commitment to bettering customer experiences and creating a leg of holding the innovation torch in the area. Sustainability at the forefront The establishment of the Singapore campus should focus on sustainability and work only using renewable energy, following Apple Inc.’s global strategy. The campus is driving towards the gold-level LEED certification, demonstrating Apple’s broader sustainability strategies. Apple’s considerable investment in growing its Japanese office reveals its strategic intention to construct the AI segment properly. While it is not yet clear when iOS 18 will become available to consumers, it is clear that these new features will be a source of inspiration for enhanced collaboration and innovation for everyone using the Mac platform in our local context. Almost on every street, passersby and onlookers will wait with keen eyes and curiosity to see what Apple – in its quest to hit the AI bullseye – produces as the construction nears completion later this year.

Eisberg delves into his early career life and the genesis of STR8FIRE in our exclusive interview. Leveraging an elite creative team and game developers, STR8FIRE bridges Web3 with the exciting world of Web2 IPs, from animations to comics, games, toys, and music. Early Inspiration Hello Christiaan, please share some insights into your early career and your role at STR8FIRE. For over 20 years, I have worked with the world’s most talented and inspiring creatives, ranging from fashion designers, graphic designers, and recording artists to comic writers, toy designers, and format developers. Like before, my main role at STR8FIRE is to support and nurture all this creative superpower and turn it into a stellar, profitable, and sustainable business where Web2 and Web3 converge seamlessly. You have a diverse background in different fields. Was there a specific event or realization that inspired you to start STR8FIRE? When I was ten, my father bought my first computer. I was mesmerized, and although I learned a bit of DOS programming, I never pursued formal studies or a professional career in the field. Then, the Internet in all its glory changed the world, and although I set up and ran an e-commerce business, I never truly seized all the opportunities it has brought us. When Web3 emerged, I recognized it as an opportunity to immerse myself fully and contribute to shaping the future, particularly within the entertainment industry. As the CEO of STR8FIRE, what aspect of the project are you most passionate about? I am most passionate about collaborating with the Web3 community and the most talented creators to develop a slate of new, original IPs. It’s the interactive process between creators and the fans at an early stage of the creative process that makes the project special. About STR8FIRE In your view, what were the gaps or shortcomings in the existing play-to-earn and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystems that STR8FIRE aims to address? Plenty of successful Web3 projects have tried and failed to enter the real world. Even with fat wallets and a thriving Web3 community, the centralized entertainment world has proven a bridge too far. Some traditional IPs have dipped their toes in the world of Web3, but don’t like to hand over ownership and control to a community they don’t understand or trust. At STR8FIRE, we connect the best of Web3: ownership and rewards through GameFi and NFTs, with the best from Web2: scaling IPs to a mainstream, global audience. The latter is the game changer, which sets us apart from others. Tell us a bit more about the team. I assume you have a diverse team involved? This is how we normally introduce the team: What do you get when you put a BAFTA-winning animator, a Marvel comic writer, and an IP developer for Disney in the same room with DeFi experts, seasoned Web3 game developers, and a handful of kick-ass Web3 entrepreneurs and investors? STR8FIRE! Although our team members each have their areas of expertise, they share a passion for telling the most original stories that captivate a global audience. This forms the foundation of our portfolio of IPs. Then, our dedicated Web3 team members help translate these IPs into our Web3 community. Please walk us through how STR8FIRE plans to leverage collaborations. They seem to be a key component of STR8FIRE’s approach. We have two types of collaborations. First, through our IP Development Fund, we support the most talented creators and develop new IPs, as well as help further grow existing renowned IPs in Web3. Second, we offer partner Web3 projects new utilities for their existing NFT collections. When staking our $STR8X token, our NFT holders and those of partner projects can upgrade their NFTs and earn exponential yield. Tell us more about STR8FIRE’s plan to release NFT collections, web3 mobile games, and an IP-based animated series. It all starts with the IPs we have already built. With our IP Development Fund, we want to create more new IPs and further grow or acquire well-known IPs, which grows the fan base and generates revenue, which we will use to back-back and burn our token. The IPs are also the driver for the development of our games. We are starting with casual, mobile games, where the players get rewarded in $STR8X, tapping into our network gaming guilds. The IPs also drive our IP-based NFT collections, with triple utility: digital collectibles, Real World perks, and, most importantly staking. During our Burning Events, our NFT holders can burn and upgrade to High APY NFTs, stake our token, and earn exponentially. How do you see this bridging of Web2 IPs and Web3 impacting both industries and the broader landscape of entertainment and gaming? The highly controlled world of IP development, which is dominated by streaming platforms and entertainment conglomerates, caters to the happy few. Consequently, even mainstream Hollywood creatives find it harder to reach and maintain audiences and raise capital to bring their ideas to the world stage. Web3 has the power to change this; through community participation and our IP development fund, we can create new and exciting IPs. Utilizing our $STR8X token, our games, and IP-based NFT collections help us bridge the worlds of Web2 and Web3 so our community can reap the financial benefits from the success of our IPs in the short- and long run. Future Projections What new features or services can users expect from STR8FIRE in the near future? We have just launched the campaign for our Genesis NFT collection, which will be ready for mint in May, leading up to our planned TGE in June. We have started production on our first casual, mobile game, have various IP-based NFT collections in production, and are developing our staking tool with our partner Decubate. This is merely a snapshot of the features we are launching in the coming months. What is your long-term vision for STR8FIRE, and how will it evolve in the next 5 to 10 years? Our long-term vision is firmly built around our portfolio of IPs, some fully original, some in co-production with big, renowned IPs. We are currently working on VIRUS, a sci-fi animation we have co-developed with Bilibili, China’s largest Animation, Comics, and Gaming platform. We are expanding it into a comic, toy collection, mobile game, and NFT collection. In addition, we are working on a new format with the largest reality TV show in the world and a major recording artist.","category":["Interview","Crypto gaming","Gaming","gaming","Intellectual property","Web 3"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c49","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=513111","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/exclusive-interview-i-anomaly-ceo-long-do/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"Exclusive Interview: Insights from Anomaly CEO, Long Do on Community-Centric Games and The Future of AI in Gaming","author":"Brian Koome","creation_date":"2024-04-18T13:11:12Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Long-Do-CEO-Anomaly-Interview.jpeg","article_summary":"In this exclusive Q&A, we explore Anomaly’s inspiration and vision with its CEO, Long Do.

Anomaly is an AI gaming app that democratizes access to Web3 through tokenization and integration with popular messengers such as Telegram, Discord, and Twitter. With over ten years of experience in Tech and a passion for gaming, Long brings a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective into Anomaly. Background Hello Long, what was the inspiration that led you to create Anomaly? From the outset, I was deeply involved in web3. I was driven by a desire to innovate at a pace that transcended traditional gaming. It wasn’t long before I recognized that we weren’t just creating games but also pioneering entirely new realms where gaming meets advanced technologies like AI. My fascination with the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence sparked the idea to found a studio that doesn’t just adapt to changes but also thrives on them, embracing the unconventional and the avant-garde, hence the name Anomaly. The term itself, reminiscent of something out of science fiction, reflects our ambitious goal to push AI towards sentience. Inspired by concepts like AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), we named our venture Anomaly Games Inc. to signify our commitment to being at the forefront of exploring and developing the unknown territories of gaming and technology. Can you walk me through your career journey leading up to your current role in Anomaly? For over ten years, I’ve been in tech as an Engineer/Tech Product Manager and have worked for many FinTech, SaaS, and even healthcare-related companies. I’ve been passionate about gaming since I first held an NES controller and played Contra on Nintendo. With a competitive streak, I’ve participated in hundreds of tournaments, achieving top ranks in prestigious events like World Cyber Games and Team Liquid Opens and success in card games like Yu-Gi-Oh. Additionally, I’ve built a strong presence on Twitch, reaching partner status and drawing in over 12,000 live viewers during my Hearthstone tournament play. In 2021, during the rise of web3, I created my own NFT game, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with NFTs. I quickly delved into developing smart contracts and introduced innovations like smart contract wallets and on-chain point systems. I was blessed to have this technology acquired by Virtually Human Studios and saw what building games like Zed Run was deep in the bull market. Jumping ahead to 2023, I developed a quest tool acquired by Moku, enabling me to actively contribute to exciting questing campaigns for Sky Mavis, such as Pixels and CyberKongz. How would you describe the current sentiment towards blockchain games? It’s certainly better than it was before! The industry has shown incredible resilience despite crazy market cycles and nefarious actors. The hype has finally died down, so now more builders are creating awesome projects and pushing boundaries in cool and innovative ways. Blockchain games prioritize their communities and create games that are actually engaging and fun. The idea of truly owning in-game assets, being able to trade them freely, and potentially earning real-value rewards from gameplay is appealing to users. As a dev, I see blockchain gaming as an incredible way to monetize games, create unique and valuable in-game assets, and build decentralized, player-owned economies while providing fairness and transparency. Anomaly AI Gaming App Anomaly’s AI gaming app chain is a significant innovation. Please tell us more about the chain and how it integrates with social media applications. I believe the gaming industry is on the cusp of a transformative shift with the advent of mini-game apps on social platforms like Telegram and now Discord. This evolution represents an untapped user acquisition and engagement frontier, particularly within the web3 space. By leveraging social platforms, games eliminate the need for users to go through cumbersome app stores or download processes. The ability to play instantly within a chat app or a community server encourages spontaneous engagement and sharing among users. As a bonus, social platforms inherently promote virality, as users can quickly invite peers to join the game within their existing networks. As a Layer 3 blockchain platform, Anomaly is designed to surpass traditional blockchain limits, focusing on creating an innovative and revolutionary decentralized gaming ecosystem. Anomaly is enhancing gaming privacy with DePIN – we want to protect user data without compromising interactive and immersive gameplay. Complementing our DePIN infrastructure, Anomaly utilizes roll-up technology to enhance scalability and efficiency, ensuring that our blockchain can handle the high demands of modern gaming and AI computations without sacrificing speed or user experience. Please walk us through the nodes’ role in creating a unique gaming experience. You have an upcoming node sale, right? Yes, we do! Our ecosystem’s growth is intricately linked to our roadmap of gaming innovations. We are committed to aggressively developing and launching new games (including new tokens), each designed to funnel tokens back into the ecosystem and directly benefit Node operators. The unique mechanics of each game will dictate the specific contributions to the node allocation pool, ensuring all Node holders share in the success of every new game launch. Purchasing a Node NFT is not only an investment in the infrastructure that powers validators for our blockchain but also a strategic move to gain a substantial allocation of ecosystem tokens. These tokens are distributed as daily rewards to Node NFT holders, embedding direct value into our community. What about the play-to-airdrop model? How does it encourage players to participate and engage with the community among players? Our approach to community engagement is built around the play-to-airdrop model, which rewards users for their participation and time invested. We recognize the value of their effectiveness in acknowledging their efforts. To further encourage participation, we plan to introduce a Socials/Referrals leaderboard, offering prizes to top-performing users and fostering a sense of friendly competition. The model’s fundamental principle is to recognize and reward participation and contribution, but it’s the highly engaged users who receive a disproportionate share of incentives, receiving more prizes as a testament to their commitment and active involvement in the ecosystem. At its core, the model is designed to reward participation and contribution. However, it’s the high-level users who receive a greater incentive, awarded more prizes in recognition of their engagement and dedication to the ecosystem. This approach does more than just incentivize activity; it encourages a vibrant, engaged community where contributions are visible and valued. We build a stronger, more connected community by rewarding participation and fostering a competitive yet cooperative environment. This enhances the overall experience for all users and solidifies the foundation of our ecosystem, driving us toward a shared vision for the future. What role do you see partnerships playing towards the growth of the project? A healthy ecosystem requires many moving parts, and I see partnerships benefit our community and the industry as a whole. By joining forces with respected entities within the crypto and gaming ecosystems, we can tap into existing networks of active users and make inroads into new user populations. Also, it’s no secret that partnering with well-established brands provides credibility, encouraging potential players who might otherwise be skeptical about the legitimacy of a Web3 game. As the game grows beyond its initial phase, partnering with other projects becomes vital to ensure scalability and maintain performance standards for our users. I believe a strategic approach to partnerships can truly help transform a Web3 game from a fleeting novelty into a sustainable, continually evolving gaming platform that keeps players engaged for the long haul. We believe in forging partnerships that align with our core values, resonate with our vision, and, most importantly, deliver on our promises to the user. Web2 games have long been the go-to choice for many players. How does Anomaly position itself against competition? We have learned a few things from our time in the web3 industry. Yes, Web2 games are more seamless and are definitely of more quality. We should absolutely try our best to be a game that upholds high standards. The other thing is that web3 offers a unique set of advantages. Web3 games are built with strong communities that are open-minded for new types of games. They don’t need to have the same goals as web2. At Anomaly, we are crafting a platform that allows us to build faster, prototype, and utilize technology to its pinnacle, which leverages the web3 community and is at the forefront of AI innovation. We aren’t also just slapping in the word AI for marketing and calling it a day. We actually have working games where you are playing against an AI agent and not just in an NPC-type dialogue, but where you can’t even tell if they are a real person and that’s just the beginning. Upcoming Games and Projections What games can users anticipate from upcoming releases? We actually have two upcoming games: Dicestone and Wildstone. Dicestone is a simple competitive dice game played against an LLM. We explain the game’s rules to the LLM in natural language and then pass through the board state every turn. With these inputs, the LLM can function as a fully effective opponent player without additional programming. With further training, the LLM can adopt particular player styles – perhaps modeled on different individuals in the player community – providing rich and varied opponent types. Wildstone is not your average card game. It revolutionizes gaming with a unique blend of traditional card gameplay and cutting-edge AI mechanics. Inspired by Marvel Snap, the current top-earning mobile game, grossing $100M in revenue in 2023, Wildstone’s progression system allows players to level up, earn in-game currency, and unlock a vast collection of cards. Enhanced by AI technology, every generated card adds depth and excitement to the dynamic and strategic deck-building experience. Can you share a sneak peek into future plans for Anomaly? We want to build a new community of like-minded enthusiasts for AI and web3 and meet them where they are on platforms like Telegram. We will take this a step further, explore other social platforms, and delve into new game audiences where we can introduce new technologies and game mechanics. We are very excited about our gamified cloud node service. Many blockchains like Xai and Gala have started introducing the idea of mining and running node validators that allow speculators to invest. Everyone knows about Bitcoin mining, but it is so out of reach for most users because of the sophistication and the sheer power required to mine successfully. We aim to bridge the gap for anyone to be a node validator with no complicated setup needed. We are crafting Wildstone as a game that can possibly be as enjoyable as Mobile Game of the year Marvel Snap, but takes it further with the community, player agents, AI-as-a-game engine, and more. We are very excited to build a unique game that changes how we perceive how AI can interact with users. What’s your prediction about the future of blockchain gaming? Well, the most obvious prediction is that blockchain gaming is here to stay. The convergence of gaming with blockchain technology paints a vibrant future for the industry, promising a world where games are more immersive, inclusive, and interconnected than ever before. We’re not just playing games; we’re stepping into them, owning a part of their very fabric, and shaping their futures. The journey ahead for blockchain gaming is not just exciting; it’s revolutionary.","category":["Interview","Industry News","News","artificial intelligence","gaming"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c4a","guid":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=513106","article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tsmcs-q1-profit-surpasses-forecast-ai-demand/","website_source":"cryptopolitan","_type":"article","article_title":"TSMC’s Q1 Profit Surpasses Forecasts Due to Increased AI Demand","author":"Aamir Sheikh","creation_date":"2024-04-18T13:10:28Z","thumbnail_image":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2e096a9a-2759-491c-8dca-d63e543d26ee.jpg","article_summary":"TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation) reported profits for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.

The profit exceeded what was expected due to the increased demand of semiconductors as a result of the artificial intelligence industry’s massive growth. The estimated income forecast by Reuters was T$218.1 ($6.7 billion) for the first quarter of 2024, but the announced figure exceeded that by a big margin. TSMC reported a net income of T$225.49 (Taiwanese dollar), which is quite higher than last year’s net income, which was T$206.00 billion. Source: TSMC. TSMC reports a 16% growth in sales. Back in 2023, TSMC faced low demand for silicon due to fewer chip requirements in the market, which provided a lower base for comparison with the current earnings. Due to this stronger year-on-year rise, the percentage of income improvement is 16.5%, amounting to T$592.64 billion in revenue for the first quarter. Another factor to consider is that the Taiwan dollar saw a decline during this time, which also helped in boosting TSMC earnings in USD. The improvement in revenue and profit is also due to the increasing demand for silicon chips in the artificial intelligence sector. TSMC is an important player in the chip making industry and one of the largest manufacturer, its earnings and sales are also considered a barometer for global silicon demand. Major tech firms like Nvidia and Apple rely on TSMC for Semiconductors Some major tech firms also provide a good loyalist base for TSMC to be the largest chipmaker in the world for contractual manufacturing. Its big customers include Nvidia and Apple, which rely on TSMC for some part of their chip needs. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said, “Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power,” adding “more than double this year.” TSMC VP and CFO, Wendell Huang, expected better results for Q2, he said, “Our business in the first quarter was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand.” He also added, “Moving into second quarter 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3nm and 5nm technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality.” Source: TSMC. Nvidia is the innovator of some of the highly advanced AI chips that are currently available on the market, and this also makes it one of the important buyers and a good source of demand. TSMC is also expecting a 30% rise in sales for the second quarter. This assumption is based on the increasing demand for semiconductors used in AI applications, especially data centers, which demand chips in huge quantities. Datacenters are shifting from traditional servers to AI capable servers, which has had a good impact on TSMC profits.

First of all, it is necessary to point out that China is the donor of the conflict and is willing to preserve its status as the leader of the world economy. First and foremost is the GenAI, whose AI (advanced Artificial Intelligence type) is integrated with this where GenAI serves as a developing source and GenAI-the with this advanced Artificial Intelligence AI. Not as bad as the worst, according to IDC (International Data Corporation), but bad enough to make this announcement a tough one to deliver. There was a significant drop in the market share fruit of the iPhone during this period; it was 9.6% lower compared to the results of the first quarter of 2040. The situation may taste bittersweet because Samsung managed to win this world bonus of winning sales market share with up to 50 million units sold. In comparison, Apple only accounts for about 46 million units. Geopolitical tensions and the GenAI gap contribute to sales decline Firstly, these two drivers, which are iPhone and iPad sales’ fall and increased growth of consumers in those areas particularly, are the biggest to the redness shift of Apple’s revenue. Those in-recessing trade tiffs between the US and China have largely been global people’s existence as the results have been long. Notwithstanding that Apple is fighting mobile market giants, the Chinese consumer has the flexibility to choose from various brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, and others. Apple sales units decreased because of the government’s strict fight with the local brands, which attracted consumers by creating a bad image in which Apple lost its originality, which affected its revenue sheets. Apple, Inc., as for the AI market, is not working for a particular one with many institutions. It can become the industry leader, distancing itself from the competition among the other companies. It produces a notion that Apple is not taking any risks in not only the adoption of the aggressive counter-strategy but also even in the considerable amount of investment in its technologies by which it pours its home-brewed technology into a product, in the greatest competition; Samsung already stands out and is now side by side with the other players’ competitors. Apple’s opportunity: Developer conference and AI integration However, the problems will persist even though developers will attend the Apple conference in late June; the new trend will be guided in how they overcome them and how the market will remain fair and even. This A+ also unveils so much of the other side of the problem when upgrading to OS versions. On the other hand, I would expect the product they will release to the market to be processed with the facet of the enhanced natural ingredient and even contain artificial. Gen AI features that go to the full extent. On the other hand, the points may talk about functionalities, and the constituent items may be text-writing generation, text translation, video transcription, and image-based generation. Besides, we can also say that iOS performance depends on the availability of a more powerful processor in the hardware that offers super fast and high-timing performance. Consequently, the new iPhones that are marveled at as the masterpiece of smartphone products for the high-end sector will come with super smart AI, which will be housed in the device as the high-end computational capabilities of the processor provide high power. A decisive response and potential turnaround The uncertainties surrounding a dramatic uptick in your current revenue numbers, accompanied by challenging quarters ahead, caution against ignoring such possibilities. Thus, this should be enough to steer you away from fretting over diversion from GenAI’s development prospects. However, by 2020, if Apple succeeds in building a superior GenAI that duly takes over the market, this constellation is the possible scenario that sees product growth. However, this may cause people to feel very bad about the company and make it fail to return to its position in the market before. Therefore, It would be necessary to display the company`s positive side by demonstrating the company’s new products well, after which it will be capable of winning back the position of the smartphone market leader. This competition can take many different directions, such as spreading demand to other wafer makers or creating an extreme chain of associations, as the intricacy of the product range and the extent of a global market will be considered. Coca-Cola must prepare itself to create innovative strategies to tackle the changing market shifts. Looking for a pencil with writing virtually any issue?

The SNX token is an ERC20 token, and therefore it is compatible with ETH wallets. Besides facilitating activities (specifically to offer collateral) within the Synthetix network, SNX holders can become SNX stakers by staking their SNX coins to earn staking rewards. Who is the Synthetix founder? Synthetix network was launched in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). Its founder is Kain Warwick. Havven (HAV) rebranded to the current Synthetix name a year later, a name it has maintained to date. Warwick is also the founder of Pouncer, a live auction Australian site, and a non-executive director at Blueshyft retail network. What is the Synthetix network? Synthetix Network is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to trade synthetic assets (synths). The protocol is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it provides liquidity for synth tokens so that traders can seamlessly trade them. The platform enables users to issue and trade synthetic assets — digital assets that represent other real assets like stocks, fiat currencies, commodities, or cryptocurrencies. It also has a staking mechanism that incentivizes users to provide liquidity and maintain the platform. The Synthetix Protocol was originally conceived as Havven back in 2017 by Kain Warwick. Warwick is currently also a Non-Executive Director of blueshyft- a network of over 1200 retail locations around Australia. SNX is a derivative product In a nutshell, synthetic assets are derivative products issued and traded on DeFi protocols. They are similar to traditional derivative products that derive their value from underlying assets like cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, commodities, precious metals, bonds, and stocks. The underlying assets are cataloged onto a DeFi protocol like the Synthetix network through tokenization by using smart contracts. Then the tokens, which represent a certificate of ownership of the real-world assets, are issued to investors and traders who can then go ahead and trade the derived assets without holding the real-world assets. Synthetix’s unique features Synthetix network was among the first blockchain protocols to introduce synthetic crypto assets. The synthetic cryptocurrency assets minted via the Synthetix protocol are synths and have an ‘s’ at the beginning of their names. If the underlying asset is the USD, for example, the synthetic help on Synthetix would appear as sUSD, BTC would appear as sBTC, ETH would appear as sETH, and so on. The community voted the synths for to exist on the Synthetix protocol. The prices of the underlying assets of the synths are tracked using smart contract price delivery protocols known as oracles. This system ensures no slippage or liquidity issues when trading the synths. To mint a synth on the Synthetix network, a user will have to lock up some SNX tokens in a smart contract. How to Stake SNX If you truly want to make money staking SNX, there are a few easy steps involved. First, you need to buy Synthetix and connect to a web3 wallet. Visit Mintr, the portal interface for minting and managing Synths. Connect your web3 wallet to Mintr. Click ‘Mint’ and choose what type of Synth you want to mint. Remember to maintain the collateralization ratio. Input the number of Synths you want to mint. Click ‘Mint Now’. Confirm the transaction in your web3 wallet. Afterward, your SNX token will automatically be staked. You will now be able to enjoy rewards generated from trading fees. Furthermore, you are also subject to inflation rewards. Conclusion The Synthetix (SNX) coin has bearish momentum, nearing the $4.88 mark, as bulls assert control over the market. Today’s price analysis reveals a clear uptrend, experiencing a lateral movement throughout the trading session. However, recent developments suggest a shift towards a bullish sentiment, with the price nearing its resistance level at $5.261. Analyzing the 1-day chart, SNX demonstrates a significant plunge in bearish momentum, exceeding initial expectations and reaching $4.88. However, caution is warranted as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a moderately overbought condition, potentially signaling a weakening of bullish momentum. The Bollinger Bands also depict a narrow trading range, with resistance at $5.26 and support at $3.621, suggesting a period of consolidation and a potential price reversal. Traders are advised to closely monitor price action for confirmation of a breakout or breakdown to determine the next directional bias. Similarly, the 4-hour chart reflects a bearish sentiment, with SNX stabilizing at $3.982, indicating a prevailing downward trajectory despite minor fluctuations. With the RSI hovering in slightly overbought territory and the Bollinger Bands tightening, traders should exercise caution and consider additional technical and fundamental factors when trading. In recent news, SNX surged alongside other DEX tokens following the announcement of a major governance proposal by Uniswap, the largest DEX in the industry. This proposal has the potential to reshape decentralized networks within the industry, contributing to the strong performance of SNX and other DeFi tokens like AAVE and Lido DAO amidst the broader rally in the DEX sector. As SNX continues to navigate these developments, traders should remain vigilant and adapt their strategies accordingly.","category":["Crypto Price Predictions","Blockchain News","cryptocurrency trading","cryptomarket"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c4d","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/marathon-brings-the-heat-as-bitcoin-halving-approaches","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"Marathon Brings The Heat As Bitcoin Halving Approaches","author":"Frank Corva","creation_date":"2024-04-18T13:17:14Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTk2NTUyMDQ5OTk3OTgxNjYz/bitcoin-mining-rig-fan.png","article_summary":"In a sit down with Bitcoin Magazine just days before the Halving, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings Fred Thiel articulates his plan to capitalize on the main byproduct of mining bitcoin: heat.","article_detailed_content":"While to the greater Bitcoin culture, Bitcoin halvings are seen as a celebratory event, for miners, things tend to be a tad stressful. As Bitcoiners around the world gather to celebrate block 840,000, miners are hunkering down and preparing for their reward for mining blocks to decrease by 50%, while the cost of their operations remains the same. With the next bitcoin halving scheduled to occur on April 19, one might imagine that Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining company in the world, might be worried. But after sitting down with Thiel just days before the halving, he doesn’t appear to be breaking a sweat. Why’s that? One of the reasons is that Marathon plans to generate alternative streams of revenue utilizing the heat emitted from its bitcoin mining rigs. “Bitcoin mining in and of itself does something very efficiently, which is produce heat,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. “50% of industrial energy spend is spent to heat things, so imagine if you could capture the heat from Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin miners could get paid for that. That would subsidize their cost of electricity.” During a fireside chat with Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) at the Bitcoin Policy Summit, held on April 9, 2024 in Washington, DC, Thiel shared an example of how Marathon plans to utilize the heat its miners produce. “One of the things we’re doing in Nebraska actually is we’re starting to heat greenhouses and do shrimp farming using the heat from Bitcoin mining as a byproduct,” Thiel explained to Senator Lummis. “I think you’re going to start seeing this as a way for people to grow proteins in areas of the disadvantaged world,” he added. Utilizing the heat Marathon’s miners produce is one of the ways in which Thiel is looking to change the perception of Bitcoin mining from something that’s parasitic to something that’s productive. This dovetails well with the fact that Marathon continues to improve its ability to use waste gas as fuel for its miners. Toward the end of 2023, Marathon launched a pilot project in which it mined bitcoin with energy derived solely with landfill methane, a gas that’s 80x more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. The project was a success, according to Thiel. “It was a proof of concept that showed that you could successfully mine bitcoin using landfill methane gas,” he told Bitcoin Magazine. “Mining on landfills is very hard, but we were able to prove that you could do it quite successfully.” Thiel expanded on these efforts in his conversation with Senator Lummis, tying together the ideas that Marathon could produce this heat it plans to use while having a positive impact on the environment. “You generate energy with that by turning it into methane and then converting that into electricity and you create heat with the electricity,” he told Senator Lummis. “If you can take a waste product, turn it into energy and feed heat back into an industrial process, you do more for the environment than a lot of environmentalists want. And at the same time, your cost to mine bitcoin becomes very small because your energy cost is low.”","category":["Business","Marathon Digital Holdings","Bitcoin Miner","News","Bitcoin mining"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c4e","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-releases-bitcoin-education-series","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"BlackRock Releases Bitcoin Education Series","author":"Nik Hoffman","creation_date":"2024-04-17T16:02:21Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODA1MTUzNTc4NjU3NjYz/mjawotm3mdy0nzczmdaynji2.jpg","article_summary":"The worlds largest asset manager continues to market and educate new investors on its spot Bitcoin ETF.","article_detailed_content":"BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm with over $10.5 trillion in assets under management, has unveiled a series of educational content aimed at explaining Bitcoin, the Bitcoin halving, and its implications, along with insights into its approved spot Bitcoin ETF. \"April is packed with rare events this year, with eyes set on the upcoming bitcoin halving - a unique process that only happens every 4 years,\" said U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, Jay Jacobs. \"Tune in below to learn how this impacts bitcoin's value, and for more about investing in bitcoin ETFs.\" JUST IN: BlackRock releases educational #Bitcoin video. pic.twitter.com/CLaMtQtzDS — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 In a series of four videos, available on BlackRock's official website, the asset manager discusses the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin as an investment, addressing common questions and concerns for investors looking to understand and navigate the Bitcoin landscape.

I will not refer to it as a whitepaper, those are real academic documents for adults. In the cartoon, interspersed amongst the absurd childish narratives, were a few valuable technical insights regarding different scaling proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Of course, in true cartoon fashion, buried between wild exaggeration and embellishment. The end goal of the cartoon was to propose a new mechanism for moving in and out of scaling layers built on top of Bitcoin. To disentangle that actual proposal from the cartoon, we’ll have to break down the two pieces involved. The Building Blocks Rijndael’s first OP_CAT experiment was constructing a vault, a scheme that allows a user to create an intermediate “staging” transaction to withdraw their funds from the vault. This kicks off a timelock, during which they can at any time send their funds back to the vault or a secure cold storage wallet, and after the timelock the user can freely withdraw the funds to the destination they chose when beginning the withdrawal process. These are the only two ways bitcoin sent to the vault script can be spent. Explaining the full mechanics of how this is accomplished is essentially an article in itself, so I’m going to do something I usually don’t and hand waive this away as “magic.” (Explained here by Andrew Poelstra) What this “magic” allows you to do, by creating non-standard Schnorr signatures and with the help of OP_CAT, is to build the transaction the signature check is against on the script stack. This lets you enforce that certain parts of the transaction are exactly as defined ahead of time. It also allows you to put the output from a previous transaction on the stack in the process of building the transaction spending it, meaning you can compare outputs from the spending transaction against outputs from the previous transaction. This allows you to guarantee by comparing them that certain parts of the previous transaction’s outputs match certain parts of the new outputs. I.e. the script, or an amount. So you can “carry forward” parts of the old outputs into the new ones, and enforce that. Something else you can do with OP_CAT, which did not need Rijndael tinkering and experimenting with to prove, is verify merkle tree branches. Because you can CAT stack items together, and Bitcoin already supports hashing data on the stack, you can slowly build up a merkle tree root from a leaf node with the interior nodes. Hash two pieces together to get one hash, hash that with the pair hash, and so on. Eventually you get the root hash on the stack. You can then compare it with OP_EQUAL against a predefined root hash in the locking script. Unilateral Withdrawal These two building blocks are enough to facilitate a unilateral withdrawal mechanism from a group shared UTXO. A merkle root can be embedded in a transaction using OP_RETURN or another mechanism that commits to a leaf node for each user. The UTXO script can be structured so that any user with a balance can attempt to withdraw it. To do so they would provide the merkle branch committing to the amount they are entitled to, the authorization proof such as a public key to check a signature against, and construct the transaction on the stack to verify the appropriate conditions are met. Similar to Rijndael’s OP_CAT vault, this withdrawal transaction would function as a staging point. User funds would be restricted by a timelock, and they would not be capable of completing the withdrawal until it expires. At any time before the timelock expires, any other user can create a fraud proof to stop the withdrawal and shove funds back into the group UTXO script. They can do this because of OP_CAT’s ability to verify merkle trees. If someone has used a specific merkle branch to withdraw funds from the UTXO before, then that was included in a block somewhere. By constructing a transaction containing the SPV proof of that transaction inside an actual block, which can use OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL to verify the blockheader meets some minimum difficulty, they can prove on the stack that the merkle branch was used before. This allows duplicate withdrawals to be prevented. In addition to this, because you can use the “CAT on the stack” trick to ensure specific pieces of a previous transaction must be included in the next, you can guarantee that the current merkle root is carried forward into the next transaction after a successful withdrawal. You can also guarantee that change from the withdrawal goes back into the group sharing script. This guarantees that after one user withdraws their funds, the change UTXO is locked with a script that allows any remaining user to withdraw, and so on. Any user can unilaterally withdraw their funds at any time in any order, with the guarantee that the remainder of funds are still accessible to the rest of the users. The VM Part Readers should be familiar with the basic idea of BitVM. You can take an arbitrary computation and break it up into each of its constituent pieces and embed them in a large taproot tree, turning that computation into a back and forth challenge/response game. This allows you to lock bitcoin with more complicated conditions than is directly supported by bitcoin script itself. The only real shortcoming is the need to craft a massive amount of pre-signed transactions to facilitate this. The requirement to use pre-signed transactions is so that in the challenge/response dynamic, you can guarantee that coins are spent back into the large taproot tree encoding it unless an exit condition one way or the other is reached. OP_CAT and the ability to “carry forward” data from previous transactions allows you to guarantee that without needing pre-signed transactions. So not only does this scheme allow any user to unilaterally exit on their own, it also allows locking conditions supported by a second layer that are not supported by Bitcoin script to actually be enforced in the withdrawal process. I.e. if some coins were encumbered by a smart contract the base layer doesn’t understand, and then withdrawn from the second layer, those more complicated conditions could still be settled correctly on the base layer as the coins are withdrawn. The Missing Piece One thing that OP_CAT does not enable is updating a merkle tree root representing user balances off-chain verifiably. It can enable an already committed state to facilitate unilateral withdrawals, but that is because a whole section of the tree is actually put on-chain and verified. To update that root off-chain by definition means you are not putting the data on-chain. This represents a problem. There is no way with just CAT to efficiently verify that all changes to the merkle tree were authorized properly by the relevant users. Someone(s) has to be trusted, and by the nature of things capable of spending the UTXO however and wherever they want, to efficiently replace an old state root with a new one to represent all off-chain balance changes. A new opcode in addition to OP_CAT, such as OP_ZKVERIFY, would be needed to do this in a trustless manner. This wouldn’t be the end of the world without OP_ZKVERIFY though. The entity updating the merkle root for off-chain transfers could be an n-of-n multisig, with 100% of the participants required to sign off on any root changes. This boils down to the same trust model as BitVM based pegs, where as long as a single honest participant exists, no one's funds can be stolen. It is a stark improvement over existing BitVM designs however when it comes to the withdrawal process. In BitVM pegs, users do not have a unilateral withdrawal mechanism. Peg operators must be trusted to fulfill user withdrawals, knowing that they can claim back funds they have spent doing so relatively trustlessly from the BitVM peg. While the incentives of this are very solid, it still does require users essentially getting permission from someone else to exit the system, they cannot do it on their own. With CatVM, users can claim back their funds unilaterally, and an operator is not required to front their own liquidity to process withdrawals. Wrapping Up Overall, the design is incomplete in terms of construction. This is not something I would call a Layer 2 in and of itself. It is the core of one, the mechanism and structure for how funds are locked into a Layer 2, and the process for how users can withdraw their funds. It definitely has a lot of flexibility and usefulness to it. In the worst case scenario, users do not need anyone’s permission to safely claim their funds back on-chain. It also allows more flexible programmability of funds, while still carrying the enforcement of those conditions to the base layer in the event of worst case unilateral exits. If one day we do eventually get something like OP_ZKVERIFY, the off-chain state progression can become an actually trustless process. I don’t expect any concrete demos in the near future, but it definitely is a sound idea in my opinion, and something worth considering. It also shows that the wizards are doing a little more than just pumping stupid jpegs.","category":["OP_CAT","Opinion","CatVM","Technical"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c50","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/breaking-down-the-2024-bitcoin-halving-implications-and-predictions-for-bitcoin-miners","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/breaking-down-the-2024-bitcoin-halving-implications-and-predictions-for-bitcoin-miners","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"Breaking Down The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Implications and Predictions for Bitcoin Miners","author":"El Sultan Bitcoin","creation_date":"2024-04-17T15:00:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAzMDk1NzUyNDUxOTY3/default_bitcoin_miners_bracing_for_the_halving_1.jpg","article_summary":"What lies after Bitcoin’s 4th halving? Read on to understand its economic and operational impacts for the Bitcoin mining sector.","article_detailed_content":"The Bitcoin halving event, a pivotal occurrence, is scheduled for April, 19 2024. This quadrennial event will reduce the block subsidy for Bitcoin miners from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, thereby halving the reward that miners receive for their efforts. Such events have historically led to profound shifts in the mining landscape, potentially influencing various economic and operational facets of Bitcoin mining. Economic Outlook and Market Predictions After the halving, the immediate impact is a considerable decrease in miner revenue due to the reduced block subsidy. This could lead to a decline in the hashrate as less efficient miners may turn unprofitable and exit the network. Luxor’s Hashrate Index Research Team projects about 3-7% of Bitcoin’s hashrate could go offline if Bitcoin’s price maintains its current level. However, if prices fall, up to 16% of the hashrate could become economically unviable, depending on the trajectory of Bitcoin prices and transaction fees post-halving. The hashrate, a critical security measure for Bitcoin, might adjust along with difficulty levels to align with the new economic realities. Luxor’s analysis suggests different scenarios where the network's hashrate could end up ranging from 639 EH/s to 674 EH/s by year's end, reflecting adjustments to the new earning potential post-halving. ASIC Pricing and Breakeven Points Post-halving, the profitability of different ASIC models will become crucial as the mining reward drops. Lower rewards mean that only the most efficient machines will be able to operate profitably if the price of Bitcoin does not see a significant increase. For instance, according to Luxor’s projections, next-generation ASICs like the S19 XP and M30S++ might have breakeven power costs ranging from $0.07/kWh to $0.15/kWh, depending on post-Halving hashprice. This shift in profitability will likely lead to a repricing of ASIC machines. Historical data suggests that ASIC prices are highly correlated with hashprice; therefore, the anticipated reduction in hashprice will prompt a downward adjustment in ASIC values. This will particularly impact older and less efficient models, potentially accelerating their phase-out from the market. The Role of Custom ASIC Firmware Post-Halving To combat reduced profitability, miners are increasingly turning to custom ASIC firmware to improve the efficiency of their hardware. Firmware like LuxOS and BraiinsOS can enhance the performance of machines by optimizing their power usage and hashrate output, thus lowering the breakeven point for electricity costs. For example, underclocking an S19 with custom firmware could extend its operational viability by reducing its power draw, thereby maintaining profitability even at lower hashprices. Public miners, in particular, are adopting custom firmware to boost the efficiency of their fleets. Companies like CleanSpark and Marathon have reported using custom solutions to enhance their operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to grow as more miners seek to maximize their output and minimize costs in the face of decreasing block rewards. 2024 Bitcoin Halving and Beyond The 2024 Bitcoin Halving is set to reshape the mining landscape significantly, just as previous halvings have. While the exact outcomes are uncertain, the event will undoubtedly present both challenges and opportunities. Miners who plan strategically, taking into account both economic forecasts and operational efficiencies, will be better positioned to navigate the post-halving environment. For those in the Bitcoin mining industry, staying informed and adaptable will be key to leveraging the halving event as an opportunity rather than a setback. With the right preparations, particularly in ASIC management and firmware optimization, miners can continue to thrive even under tightened economic conditions.

NEW: 🇭🇰 Hong Kong #Bitcoin ETFs to start trading by 30th April and could bring in $25 billion: Reports Just a matter of time 🚀 pic.twitter.com/Y1Xo4JVrO7 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 17, 2024 The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) recently approved several fund managers to offer spot bitcoin ETFs. Following this, OSL, a crypto infrastructure provider for some approved fund managers, stated that the bitcoin ETFs are aiming to go live as early as late April. Markus Thielen, founder of research firm 10x, also stated that the Bitcoin ETFs could start trading by April 30th. The launch timeline will depend on finalizing details with regulators. Once listed, analysts predict the accessible funds could attract significant capital inflows. Singapore-based Matrixport expects mainland Chinese investors to pour up to $25 billion into Hong Kong's Bitcoin ETFs via the Southbound Stock Connect program. Thielen echoed this sentiment, stating the ETFs could yield $25 billion if fully accessible to Chinese investors. However, he noted that Chinese participation may take at least six months due to evolving regulations. Nonetheless, the ETFs mark a milestone for Bitcoin adoption in Asia. They provide regulated exposure to bitcoin, opening the assets to a broader range of investors. The funds' unique in-kind redemption feature also makes them competitive globally. This allows swapping bitcoin directly for ETF shares, increasing efficiency. Click the image to learn more. By approving the ETFs, Hong Kong cements its position as a rising Bitcoin hub. The city is moving swiftly to license Bitcoin companies and products amid growing demand. With bitcoin's next halving just days away, the ETF launch timing is opportune. Many predict the supply shock event will propel Bitcoin to new highs, benefiting linked investment vehicles. If successful, Hong Kong's spot ETFs could prompt other Asian jurisdictions to follow suit. The domino effect would boost regional participation and maturity for the Bitcoin market.","category":["China","Business","News","Spot Bitcoin Etf","Hong Kong"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c52","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/rights-reason-revolution-in-dc-at-the-bitcoin-policy-summit","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/rights-reason-revolution-in-dc-at-the-bitcoin-policy-summit","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"Rights, Reason, Revolution: In DC at the Bitcoin Policy Summit","author":"Stephen Pollock","creation_date":"2024-04-17T14:30:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1ODAyODMyMTQ4ODMzMzkx/default_bitcoin_lobbyists_presenting_at_a_conference_to_congre_0.jpg","article_summary":"A retrospective look at the recent Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C.","article_detailed_content":"In the whirlwind of April 2024, with Bitcoin ETFs dominating headlines and halving celebration planning in full swing, the Bitcoin Policy Summit emerged as a pivotal moment for policymakers, industry leaders, and human rights champions. Against the backdrop of global discussions on Bitcoin regulation—and coinciding with a solar eclipse—the summit aimed to be a beacon of reason and a catalyst for action in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. The Bitcoin Policy Summit boasted a remarkable turnout, with more than 45,000 individuals tuning into the livestream. Among the 500+ in-person attendees were representatives from 26 universities, 75 government officials, and 250 public policy professionals. The summit also garnered attention from over a dozen media outlets. Notably, elected leaders from both major political parties were present, alongside representatives from prominent organizations such as the World Bank, World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund (IMF), State Department, Department of Commerce, Treasury Department, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The summit, with its diverse mix of voices and perspectives, shed light on the pressing need for smart and informed decision-making in the realm of digital asset policy. While Bitcoin symbolizes financial freedom and empowerment, it also brings its fair share of challenges, from concerns about money laundering to energy usage. The summit tackled these complex issues head-on, offering insights into the multifaceted world of Bitcoin as it relates to mining, geopolitics, the future of money, and human rights. The Bitcoin Policy Summit witnessed a significant turnout of policymakers committed to safeguarding the opportunities presented by Bitcoin and addressing its associated challenges. Figures such as Senators Marsha Blackburn, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Cynthia Lummis, alongside House members Wiley Nickel, Tom Emmer, and Patrick McHenry, lent their expertise and bipartisan support to the discussions. Their active involvement not only enriched the conversation but also signaled a united effort to ensure that digital asset policies foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold transparency and accountability. One of the most striking features of the summit was its focus on the intersection of Bitcoin and human rights, with speakers like Felix Maradiaga, 2024 Nobel Prize Nominee and prominent human rights advocate from Nicaragua; Anna Chekhovich, financial director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) founded by Alexei Navalny; Roya Mahboob, Afghan entrepreneur and women's rights advocate; and Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian human rights activist. Their combined emphasis on Bitcoin’s critical role in defending human rights and freedom of expression in the face of dictators and oppressive regimes shed light on broader roles for digital assets that many in the United States may not have previously considered. Furthermore, the summit stressed the importance of taking a global perspective on digital asset regulation to protect human rights. In a world where digital assets know no borders, fragmented regulatory approaches risk creating loopholes and undermining financial integrity. Human rights activists stressed the need to protect privacy, free speech, and equal access to financial services for all, regardless of where they are. The conference hall buzzed with anticipation as attendees dispersed into three specialized rooms for afternoon deep dive tracks: Mining & Energy, Geopolitics, and Future of Money. Concurrent programming featured keynotes such as “A Climate Scientist’s Perspective on Bitcoin” by Margot Paez, BPI fellow and PhD candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. Fireside chats and panels included \"Bitcoin & Financial Inclusion\" with Chastity Murphy from the U.S. Treasury, and \"Countering Digital Authoritarianism\" featuring renowned writer Roger Huang, author of ‘Bitcoin and China’, and Jorge Jrsaissati, President of the Organization for Economic Inclusion. One of my personal highlights from the Bitcoin Policy Summit was engaging in a fireside chat with Senator Marsha Blackburn from my home state of Tennessee. We explored the connection between Bitcoin and her advocacy for consumer rights and privacy. Additionally, we discussed Tennessee's growing prominence as a Bitcoin hub and her stance on CBDCs (spoiler: she’s not a fan). It's truly inspiring to witness elected leaders championing both monetary and digital freedoms, reinforcing their commitment to safeguarding these fundamental rights. Another standout moment occurred during a post-summit dinner with Felix Maradiaga and his wife, Berta Valle. Felix, who endured four years of imprisonment under a Nicaraguan dictator, shared firsthand accounts of political dissent and activism. These experiences underscore the importance of Bitcoin as a decentralized monetary network, providing resilience against oppression. The 2024 Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington D.C. served as a crucial platform for educating policymakers and advocating for Bitcoin's role in shaping a freer and more sustainable financial future. Through candid dialogue, diverse perspectives, and collaborative efforts across sectors, participants witnessed the transformative potential of Bitcoin to advance global human rights, bolster national security, and accelerate renewable energy adoption. As we reflect on the insights garnered from the summit, let's seize this pivotal moment to shape a regulatory landscape that not only fosters innovation and economic growth but also champions human dignity, justice, and liberty.

Analyst Dylan LeClair unpacks whether this represents a true shift in momentum, or simply a bull market correction as bitcoin moves higher.","article_detailed_content":"This article is written in partnership with Unchained, the official US Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine and integral sponsor of related content published through Bitcoin Magazine.

Bitcoin tumbled below $60,000 over the weekend, fueled by conflict between Iran and Israel, sparking fears that escalation could lead to Western involvement in a war in the Middle East—an all too common occurrence in the 21st century that would lead to increased inflationary pressures and disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets. While skeptics were quick to mock bitcoin’s near instantaneous selloff in reaction to the news of conflict, ironically bitcoin was one of the only global asset open for trading on the weekend, with equities, commodities, and bond strategists alike turning their eyes to the bitcoin chart in an attempt to assess what the damage might be to global markets upon the Sunday night trading open. Turning away from geopolitics, this brief article will take a look at the latest in on-chain spending behavior and Bitcoin derivative markets, to analyze whether the current dip from the highs of $73,000 is typical of a standard bull market correction or more so a cyclical peak. Many preconceived notions of a typical Bitcoin cycle have already been shattered with new highs being broken before the upcoming halving taking place on block 840,000. So let's evaluate and take a look at where we are, and how these conditions and investor behavior also inform what might come next. We’ll be looking at both on-chain data, to analyze the actions of incumbent Bitcoin hodlers and new market entrants alike, before taking a look at the derivatives market to gauge whether there is anything worrisome in regards to the leverage currently present in the market. Unchained is the Official Collaborative Custody Partner of Bitcoin Magazine. Click here to learn more about Unchained's bitcoin financial services and receive exclusive discounts on Unchained vault, Signature and IRA. First, we’ll take a look at a metric called the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, coined and created by TXMC, which compares near-term spending behavior to the yearly average, as a means of detecting overheated and undervalued markets. A brief look at this signals that the bull market is well underway, and may have even peaked. The exact calculation of the metric, for those curious, is the ratio of two daily moving averages (30, 365) of Value Days Destroyed (Coin Days Destroyed * Price), then adjusted for supply inflation to account for changes in spender behavior over time. We can attribute approximately one third of the spending as a simple transfer of coins from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to new ETF participants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise. However, the raw data is just that—the raw data, and we can see there has been a significant amount of spending that’s occurred with the push to new highs. A closer look at the metric, however, shows that this spending activity is cooling off, and there is historical precedent for new highs in the market in both the 2017 and 2021 cycle - this is merely a data point to keep in mind. Next, taking a look at the interplay between HODLers and new entrants, viewed through the lens of short-term and long-term holders, we can see that during a typical bull market, revisits to the cost basis of short-term holders are not only typical but also quite healthy. Additionally, the ability for this approximate price level to serve as support is a characteristic of bull markets, with the inverse being true in a bear market, where this psychological level of average short-term holder price (cost basis) often serves as ironclad psychological and technical resistance. As for where that level is today, approximately $58,500, which means that by no means is a visit to this level a guarantee or certainty, but rather it is something that is perfectly in the norm of expected activity in a bull market. Turning our attention to the derivatives market, there has been a healthy flush of leverage and speculative froth across the market. Perpetual futures open in bitcoin terms are near the lowest levels seen since 2022, while futures have been trading at a slight discount to spot markets since the weekend flush lower. While there is no law or guarantee that this brings about higher prices immediately, similar positioning in the past has fostered the conditions for price appreciation, and when compared to the top-heavy speculative froth of a speculative premium in futures market pricing observed over the last month or so, it is a welcomed development. In terms of points of interest when eyeing the derivatives landscape, the buildup of liquidatable leverage above $70,000 continues to grow, with emboldened shorts looking to push price meaningfully below $60,000. While there is some leverage to be purged under the $60,000 level, the real prize for bears is under the $50,000 level. While certainly crazier things have happened in Bitcoin than a -33% pullback from all-time highs, spot demand is likely to be strong from $50,000, and a wipe of open interest and the start of a negative futures premium relative to spot markets hint at most of the pullback having already taken place. It would likely take a significant risk-off moment across the macro landscape for this to unfold, and any dip is likely to be fleeting given the perpetuating reality of the pace of fiscal deficit spending. Conclusion: This bull market has legs, and the current pullback from the highs, along with any future dips in the exchange rate, should be a welcomed development for investors with a sufficiently long time horizon who understand where this is all headed. Bitcoin’s fundamentals continue to improve, and pullbacks serve to purge leverage and weak handed speculators during secular bull markets. BTFD.

Private When Alexander “Akin” Fernandez first conceptualized Azteco over a decade ago, he simply wanted to make bitcoin easier to obtain. He wanted people to be able to purchase bitcoin as seamlessly as they were able to buy a gift card, and so he developed a system in which people can purchase prepaid bitcoin vouchers for as little as $10, redeemable in a minute. Azteco vouchers are now available in over 190 countries, purchasable online or with cash with in-person vendors. The main advantage to buying BTC via Azteco vouchers is the fact that you don’t have to disclose your identity to do so, not to mention the process of buying a voucher is quick and easy. Azteco offers both on-chain and Lightning capabilities, giving users the choice to redeem their BTC on either the Bitcoin base chain or the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 payments network built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. According to an estimate from Fernandez, over one million people have already purchased Azteco vouchers. But his aspirations are far beyond the already-impressive number of vouchers thus sold: he has his sights set on Azteco servicing a customer base of over 30 times that, as Azteco does its part in “normalizing” Bitcoin. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows below. Frank Corva: Where did the inspiration for Azteco come from? Akin Fernandez: It came from my own experience of finding out that getting bitcoin is very difficult. I realized it doesn't have to be like this. We could use a familiar system like a top-up voucher, which billions of people use to top up their mobile phones, and apply that process to getting bitcoin. All we have to do is build a software, put distribution in place, and then it should just work. And lo and behold, it does. Corva: Did you have a particular customer base in mind when you designed Azteco? Fernandez: Yes, I had myself in mind. I wanted to be able to get bitcoin without having to make any kind of fuss or effort to do it. I wanted to be able to go to the supermarket, buy $20 worth of bitcoin and put it straight onto my wallet. And I'm not unique. I could assume that there were other people who were like me who could understand the proposition and the ease of use and who would take to it like a duck to water. You find that with inventions, many times they come about because people are solving problems for themselves, not as a means to get rich or for any reason other than to solve their own problems. And because people are similar, they solve other people's problems, too. Corva: Speaking of your own experience. I’ve read that you were unbanked for a period of time. Is this true and could you expand on it, if so? Fernandez: Well, I became unbanked for a reason that I, until this day, don't know. I went down to “my” bank to cash a check, and they couldn't find my account in the system. I had received no communication from them in writing or in any way. All of a sudden, I had no bank account. So, for many years after that I didn't have access to credit cards or anything that other people in the West take for granted. This taught me a very, very big lesson about how difficult it is to do anything in the 21st century if you don't have access to banking facilities. You can forget shopping online. You can forget any kind of convenience of going into a store and paying with a card. All of that goes away. So, when I was working on Azteco, it was made clear to me how powerful a tool it was going to be, because, with Bitcoin, you cannot be unbanked by any third party. You have control over your synthetic money. Corva: I’ve heard you use this term “synthetic money” before, and you’ve discussed how we shouldn’t refer to bitcoin as actual money. Why is it important that we do this? Fernandez: It's important because it's true. Bitcoin is not money — it's a database. Can it be used as money? Of course. It can be used as very, very good money. It's a good simulation of money. But it doesn't have to be money for it to be useful. Also, if you call bitcoin money, all the regulations that the state has imposed on actual money can be superimposed or brushed over Bitcoin inappropriately, making it hard to use and slower to spread. So, it's very important to tell the truth about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has taken so long to get into every nook and cranny because there's been this misconstruing of it as money. WhatsApp reached a billion people in four and a half years. That's the kind of spread into people's phones that we'd expect if the rails to get onto Bitcoin were frictionless, just like they are with WhatsApp. The fact that Bitcoin has not reached that number of people indicates that there's something wrong in the way people are thinking about it, and so it's important for us to think about it correctly. Corva: How many people is Azteco reaching? Put another way, how many vouchers did Azteco sell in Q3 or Q4 of 2023? Fernandez: The actual numbers I don't have at hand being the CEO and not the CFO. But we had our biggest ever month last month. I was told this yesterday. The number of vouchers we're selling is increasing, and this is a direct result of our increasing our distribution and also the sentiment towards Bitcoin changing on a global scale. We're the easiest way to get bitcoin. When people discover us, they say two things: “First of all, why isn't everything as easy as this?” and “How come I haven't heard of this before?” Things are synergizing and coming together to bring us to a point where we're a global force for good and for getting Bitcoin to the people who need it the most — the unbanked and the people who don't have access to financial rails or people who just don't want to be the victims of the financial rails. The old school crop of Bitcoin businesses that have been serving people over the last 10 years all believe that Bitcoin is money and make it very difficult to get an account. Everybody's so inured to the idea of having a bank account or an account of any kind, whether it's through email or anything else. The assumption immediately is, “Well, of course, I have to have an account in order to use this service.” With Bitcoin, that's not true, though. No accounts are necessary. [Some] wallet companies are doing this correctly. One of them is Samourai Wallet and another is Wallet of Satoshi where you don’t need to open an account to use your own money. They’re saying you shouldn’t be able to use bitcoin without having an account. That’s what they’re trying to do in the EU. Corva: We’re doing it here in the US with the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA), too, the bill that Elizabeth Warren drafted. Fernandez: These people are oath breakers. They’ve sworn an oath to defend and uphold the Constitution, which guarantees the free speech of every single American. Bitcoin is speech. It's a database where speech is written down and stored and transmitted from one person to another. And lest anyone think that I'm picking on the Democrats and not the Republicans, Cynthia Lummis has written an absolutely appalling bill that I took great pleasure in tearing to pieces on my blog. They don’t understand what their role is as a public servant. A servant is not in control of its masters. A servant is obedient to the electorate. It’s not their business to tell people you have to KYC to use bitcoin. Corva: On the topic of America and KYC-free bitcoin, do you see people using Azteco because they want KYC-free bitcoin? Fernandez: In order for the American market to be cracked, the service has to be explained. People have to be deprogrammed. They don’t understand that bitcoin is not a vehicle to make you earn more fiat. People need to be broken out of these bad habits to be shown that actually there are better ways to get things done. The perfect example of this is WhatsApp. Before WhatsApp, people used to pay for SMS messages, while the idea of this is now unthinkable. A similar process has to happen with Bitcoin where you can send money to family members without having to go through a third party or pay exorbitant fees or identify yourself or anything like that. With Bitcoin, you [also] get other subtle benefits. Hyperinflation is starting to kick in and people are starting to realize that there’s something wrong with the money. People find it very difficult to go to the root cause of the prices going up at McDonalds. Let’s say they did find out the cause, what could they do about it? They could go and get bitcoin, but it’s several steps down before these people are going to see bitcoin as the answer. Corva: I agree. Fernandez: Also, the current crop of businesses — big businesses like Binance, Coinbase — are synonymous with bitcoin. Azteco needs to be synonymous with getting bitcoin. The vast majority of people on earth are not rich. They don't have $100,000 to spend on bitcoin. They live day to day. Since these people are not investors and they don't have spare money to keep in bitcoin in the hopes that it's going to go up — which of course it will — they need to have bitcoin as daily money for everyday spending. Once you start talking about these things, the business opportunities and models start to just fall out of the conversation. All of these Cynthia Lummises and Elizabeth Warrens prevent these business models from emerging because they're regulating something they have no business regulating. Corva: Speaking of other businesses, I’ve heard you say good things about Machankura, a protocol that makes it easier for Africans to use bitcoin in a KYC manner, and that it serves as a compliment to Azteco. What other companies in the Bitcoin space are a compliment to Azteco? Fernandez: Ethical Bitcoin wallets are a good compliment. By ethical, I mean Samourai Wallet and Wallet of Satoshi. I know that some people don’t like Wallet of Satoshi because the architecture on the backend is not to their liking, but these people don’t run businesses — they don’t know how difficult it is to do these things. The newest entrant to this is the Bitkey wallet. This Bitkey wallet is absolutely unbelievable. They've thought about this properly. The user interface and user experience — it's going to make everybody change their game. I've been saying for a long time that somebody like Apple, Microsoft or some other company is going to get into Bitcoin and bring all of that user experience thinking to the process of using Bitcoin. The current crop of companies have not thought about user experience. Jack Dorsey’s Bitkey has been a kick in the backside to a lot of people who realize that we can't just carry on doing what we want to do and expecting people to just accept it — the idea that you have to write down your mnemonic before you receive your first transaction. It’s completely crazy. If Apple developed its own Bitcoin wallet or clones one of the Bitcoin wallets out there, Bitcoin is going to be exposed to people in a way that's very easy to understand, very easy to consume. There will be the new generation of Bitcoin users for whom Bitcoin is totally normal — not threatening, intimidating or frightening. Corva: The same way that using WhatsApp or Uber is normal now… Fernandez: That's exactly right. Bitcoin has to become boring.","category":["Bitcoin","Lightning","Azteco","Founders","Business"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c55","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-fashion-week","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"The Weekly Reorg: Bitcoin Fashion Week","author":"Alex Bergeron","creation_date":"2024-04-16T19:13:55Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0OTI2Njk4NjEyNjA3/default_more_like_a_catwalk_3.jpg","article_summary":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week.","article_detailed_content":"In case you missed it, Bitcoin Season 2 released part of its Spring/Summer collection last week. Amongst other things, Mezo, a “Bitcoin economic layer” came out of stealth with a $21 million fundraising round. Alpen Labs announced a $10.6 million bankroll to bootstrap a Bitcoin-native zero-knowledge infrastructure. Another posse of blockchain designers, including the folks at Starkware, got together and launched the L2O Consortium “to set standards for trustless applications and Layer 2s.” Of course, nobody knows what this all means, but it’s provocative. It gets the people going, the capital frothing, and the industry buzzing. Eight-figure seed rounds are getting thrown around and some pretty major venture players are making a comeback. Almost every day, a new layer is announced or some “Bitcoin-native” protocol you’ve never heard about announces that its users have locked a bazillion dollars worth of bitcoins into their “trustless” multi-sig protocol. So it goes in a bull market, I guess. Curiously, some of the people involved will admit it feels more like performance art than legitimate engineering. Remember the Rick Owens freak runway shows? It’s flashy alright but who’s going to wear this stuff? Keep in mind most of the new gadgets being proposed have yet to take off their training wheels anywhere they’ve been implemented. Rollups on Ethereum, for example, are still just dressed-up multi-sig. Similarly, this new crop of Bitcoin-adjacent protocol seems content launching with either no product or “decentralization on the roadmap.” Under the layers of vapid marketing and technical mumbo jumbo, it’s hard to find a trust model that is much better than the simple and often maligned Liquid federated sidechain. Forget unilateral exit, most of the “Layer 2s” on offer today can hardly qualify for the term under our admittedly loose policy here at Bitcoin Magazine. To make matters worse, variants of proof-of-stake have crept into the design space despite Ethereum’s abysmal performance since its transition. Not surprisingly, the conversation has already devolved into ponzinomics to bootstrap the speculative flywheel. Colloquially styled “points,” a new token contraption has burst onto the scene and is all the rage amongst the designer crowd. This new liquidity farming fad requires users to deposit their bitcoins (and those of friends and family) somewhere in exchange for, you guessed it, yield. They’re calling it gamification this time around. I think it’s peak crypto nihilism. Fast fashion has officially made it into Bitcoin! The Emperor Has No Clothes? Speaking of catwalks and clownishly dressed individuals, the crew at Taproot Wizards recently unleashed pandemonium on the aspiring Layer 2 community by going at its most prized science project, BitVM. My esteemed colleague Shinobi put together a decent recap of the event. I wont bother you with the technical details but, of course, the claims remain hotly contested to this day. At least a dozen new companies’ fate hangs in the balance here so you can imagine the smell when they were publicly outed to the fashion police. Although I’m partial to the wizards’ arguments, we should probably hold off on writing the obituary for BitVM. Jumping through liquidity hoops appears to be one of the pervasive tradeoffs one has to make when designing trust-minimized protocols on top of Bitcoin. Lightning has given us inbound liquidity headaches for years. Proposals like Ark have been dismissed because of the massive UTXOs operators have to fund. Maybe BitVM bridges can be designed to mitigate the upfront liquidity requirements of operators. At least, the issue is probably not enough for everyone to drop everything and go home. The unfortunate takeaway from this saga is that everyone involved comes away looking a bit amateurish. Despite claims to the contrary, some due diligence was clearly skipped. The issue could’ve been run through a bit more collective brain cells before publishing and you can tell the targets all felt pretty blindsided by the announcement. To tie this all up, the wizards have just come out with their derivative proposal. It’s hard not to get the impression that this was a bit of a setup motivated by marketing purposes. Then again, they’re grown men wearing wizard hats, what do you expect? On the other hand, it is a valid issue and the response from “team” BitVM hasn’t been exactly gracious either. You’d expect thicker skin from researchers who have been around the block. Banning people from a Telegram working group and hand-waving away the entire premise does not serve the interest of the community they are building for. They can disagree with the conclusions but the obvious outcome is that the audience and interest in BitVM have now grown beyond the small engineering circles where it was fomenting. Many have suggested it was probably the first time the mechanism was communicated in an accessible way. It was a missed opportunity for its advocates to leverage this attention and steer it their way if they thought the project was misrepresented. Hopefully, this is all just a failed dress rehearsal because I don’t see how this is very inspiring for anyone seriously interested in contributing to this space. A grand finale Of course, a circus show isn’t complete without the clown act. The hottest protocol designer in town is preparing to showcase his latest line just in time for the halving this Friday. Runes, a protocol for fungible tokens, is probably the most anticipated drop since the Jordan 1s. As we speak, hundreds of users are syncing up Bitcoin nodes for the first time in their lives in preparation for the festivities. The blockchain is expecting a record crowd for this event so be advised that tickets could get expensive. As for myself, I’ll probably just watch from my balcony in the comfort of my safe and ever-reliable Bitcoin jeans. Tick tock, next block.","category":["Technical","Culture","Layer 2"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130c56","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-devcon-to-take-place-alongside-bitcoin-asia-","article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-devcon-to-take-place-alongside-bitcoin-asia-","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine","_type":"article","article_title":"Bitcoin DevCon To Take Place Alongside Bitcoin Asia  ","author":"Bitcoin Magazine","creation_date":"2024-04-16T18:45:00Z","thumbnail_image":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Nzg0NjQ4MzMxMDQ0NzM1/devon.png","article_summary":"Bitcoin Asia will see developers from across the globe flock to Bitcoin DevCon, May 7-8.","article_detailed_content":"In addition to showcasing the world’s most important Bitcoin companies and leaders of today, Bitcoin Asia is also a platform for the next generation of Bitcoin startups to meet, build, and get in front of the community.

However, while we’re all keenly aware of BTC’s impact on financial markets (a more or less permanent fixture of the news cycle), we often forget to take a step back and look at how this new frontier affects real change and real people. For those historically marginalized by traditional banking due to barriers like poor credit or lack of accessibility, BTC has emerged as a vital financial tool. Its impact is most profound in developing countries, where access to banking still poses a challenge for many. Here, Bitcoin serves as more than a currency or an investment; it's a means to engage in essential financial activities, such as sending and receiving money, that would otherwise be out of reach. Forget, at least for a minute, the speculative potential in terms of financial gain—the true value of Bitcoin lies in its potential to level the financial playing field, offering access to financial tools that were previously exclusive to those with more established economic backgrounds. Amid its fluctuating value, the enduring promise of Bitcoin is its contribution to financial inclusivity, making it a beacon of hope for more equitable access to financial services worldwide. Historical context of Bitcoin and financial inclusivity Bitcoin was born out of the financial turmoil of the late 2000s, with its creator(s) aiming to forge a decentralized currency that could bypass traditional banking systems and help society at large traverse a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. This vision was not just technical but deeply ideological, seeking to empower individuals with financial autonomy. At its core, Bitcoin promised to make financial services accessible to anyone with internet access, regardless of their standing with conventional financial institutions. This promise has seen tangible realization in countries like Nigeria, where traditional banking services are out of reach for many. In Nigeria, Bitcoin has become more than a speculative asset—for instance, with the country's significant diaspora, Bitcoin facilitates remittances, enabling Nigerians living abroad to send money home more efficiently and at lower costs compared to traditional banking services. In Argentina, Bitcoin has emerged as a crucial financial tool amidst the country's ongoing economic challenges, including high inflation rates and currency devaluation. For Argentinians, Bitcoin offers a more stable store of value compared to the national currency, the Argentine peso, which has suffered from significant depreciation over the years. A similar trend can be noticed in Ghana, where the annual inflation rate is predicted to land in the 13% to 17% range in 2024. In Venezuela, a country grappling with political instability and economic crises, Bitcoin has found a unique role beyond just a means of preserving wealth against hyperinflation. Here, Bitcoin is being utilized to support microfinance initiatives and charitable donations, directly impacting the lives of those in need. Organizations and platforms leveraging cryptocurrency can bypass traditional financial systems, which are often inaccessible or unreliable for the country's impoverished populations, to provide direct financial assistance. Moreover, for entrepreneurs and small business owners the world over, it offers a means to engage in international transactions without the need for bank accounts or the risk of currency devaluation. It’s both a hedge against crisis and a vessel of freedom against authoritarian regimes, but the decentralization schtick isn’t The rise of Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest By allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin's price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, and managing the digital currency, BTC ETFs offer a familiar, regulated avenue for institutional investors to enter the Bitcoin space. Previously, the volatile and unregulated nature of Bitcoin deterred many institutional investors. However, with the advent of ETFs and other regulated investment products, these entities can now participate in the cryptocurrency market, bringing with them substantial capital inflows and increased legitimacy and stability to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, which will only increase with further adoption. This institutional foray into Bitcoin has a dual impact. On one hand, it introduces a level of stability and liquidity previously unseen, potentially making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for both retail and institutional investors. On the other, it represents a shift from Bitcoin's original ethos of decentralization and democratization of finance. Another point to consider is that institutional interest isn’t limited to private, for-profit enterprises—with countries like El Salvador, which recently took custody of its national Bitcoin treasury showcasing that, slowly but surely, the general attitude of governments towards cryptocurrencies is also changing with the times. Potential impacts of institutionalization on accessibility On the one hand, these developments can enhance Bitcoin's appeal by contributing to market stability and reducing volatility—a key concern that has deterred a broader demographic from embracing cryptocurrencies. The entry of institutional investors can also increase liquidity in the Bitcoin market, potentially making it a more reliable asset for individuals and businesses worldwide. However, the flip side of institutionalization is the potential increase in barriers to entry for marginalized groups. The very essence of Bitcoin's appeal to these groups is its accessibility: the ability to participate in the financial system with nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection. As regulatory frameworks become more stringent and the market more institutionalized, the processes for acquiring and using Bitcoin could become more complex. Requirements such as rigorous identity verification and compliance with financial regulations, while necessary for fraud prevention and financial security, could inadvertently sideline those without formal identification or those living in regions with less regulatory clarity. Moreover, the shift towards institutionalization might lead to a concentration of wealth and power within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reminiscent of traditional financial systems. This concentration could undermine the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, making it less about empowering the individual and more about serving institutional interests. The challenge lies in finding a balance: leveraging institutional interest to bring stability and legitimacy to Bitcoin while ensuring that its revolutionary promise of financial inclusivity remains intact. Financial inclusion and cryptocurrency adoption Sub-Saharan Africa, with its blend of limited banking infrastructure and high mobile penetration, has emerged as a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. The region, marked by its smaller overall market size in terms of traditional financial metrics, shows a significantly high level of grassroots cryptocurrency usage. Nigeria, for example, not only ranks second on the Global Crypto Adoption Index but also leads Sub-Saharan Africa in raw transaction volume, as well as the world in P2P exchange trade volume ranking. Other countries like Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa also feature prominently on the index, underlining the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as viable financial instruments The adoption is driven largely by practical necessities rather than speculative interests, with cryptocurrencies serving as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. In Ghana, where inflation surged to its highest level in two decades at the tail end of 2022, and in other nations like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa facing similar economic challenges, cryptocurrencies have become an attractive means of preserving wealth. The shift towards digital currencies, particularly Bitcoin, and more recently, stablecoins, reflects a broader search for financial stability and freedom Peer-to-peer transactions, especially prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, account for a significant portion of crypto transactions, underscoring the region's unique position in the global crypto landscape. This high rate of P2P transactions is attributed to the everyday use of crypto for retail payments, remittances, and commercial transactions. The preference for crypto over traditional banking and financial services is not just a matter of convenience but a necessity in regions where local currencies are losing value, as seen in countries like Nigeria and Kenya Through bypassing traditional financial barriers, cryptocurrencies offer expanded finance options to underserved markets, exemplified by initiatives like Empowa and Pezesha in Mozambique and Kenya that utilize blockchain to facilitate real estate development and connect MSMEs with global lenders. Balancing institutional interest and financial inclusivity As Bitcoin continues to navigate the waters between grassroots empowerment and institutional adoption, its future landscape presents a dichotomy. On one side, increased institutional interest brings stability and credibility, potentially making Bitcoin a more viable and trusted financial asset globally. On the other, this shift could challenge the very inclusivity that has been a cornerstone of Bitcoin's appeal, particularly among minority groups and in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. To ensure that Bitcoin remains a tool for empowerment, a balanced approach is necessary. One potential pathway is the development of regulatory frameworks that encourage inclusivity. Regulations could be designed to protect consumers without stifling innovation or access to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the continued support and promotion of peer-to-peer platforms can empower individuals by facilitating direct transactions without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Conclusion As Bitcoin evolves amidst rising institutional interest, its foundational role as an agent of financial inclusivity faces both challenges and opportunities. Ensuring that Bitcoin continues to serve marginalized communities requires a delicate balance, blending the stability brought by institutional involvement with its potential as a democratizing force. One thing is certain—the future of Bitcoin hinges in large part on maintaining its essence as a lifeline for financial empowerment across the globe. This is a guest post by Kiara Taylor.

This event will bring together prominent voices in the Bitcoin space including Barstool CEO Dave Portnoy, Strike CEO Jack Mallers, Bitcoin Magazine Institutional Lead Dylan LeClair, and Ten31 Managing Partner Matt Odell. This halving event – projected to occur between April 19, 2024 – will occur as Bitcoin reaches block 840,000, marking the point at which its relative supply issuance will drop below that of gold for the first time. Previous halvings have historically acted as a turning point in the market as the reduction in newly issued coins has been met with surging demand for the currency throughout each prior halving cycle. This time around, the halving has been preceded by a new all-time high, an occurrence that has never happened since Bitcoin’s inception in January 2009. Between the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States (arguably the most successful ETF debut in history) by major financial institutions, and a potential resurgence in inflation, the Bitcoin bulls are on parade driving the market higher into uncharted territory. Other guests slated to appear on the livestream are Bitcoin Magazine Chief Content Officer Pete Rizzo, Human Rights Foundation Director of Financial Freedom Christian Keroles, Simply Bitcoin Founder Nico Moran, Bitcoin Magazine Correspondent Isabella Santos, and Pomp Investments Founder Anthony Pompliano.

For as long as humans have been organizing into social groups, we’ve been hating on the group in the next valley. Even though we have much more in common with them than we would care to admit. It is not surprising therefore that bitcoiners and ethereans should hold a long-standing rivalry. As the largest blockchain ecosystems, each running on distinct architecture and supporting distinct use cases, there are fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. These differences aren’t just technical but also cultural. Just as flora and fauna on Madagascar evolved differently from that on larger land masses, distinct crypto tribes form their own culture, memes, and ideology over time. Eventually, like Montagues and Capulets, they can’t even recall why they disliked one another in the first place. But it wasn’t always that way: and it doesn’t have to stay this way. There are signs that the rivalry that has polarized bitcoiners and ethereans is starting to thaw. If these frenemies can bury the hatchet and work together, it will make web3 a better place for everyone. From Divergence to Convergence It’s easy to forget that Ethereum was born out of Bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin cut his teeth at Bitcoin Magazine and was a regular poster on the Bitcointalk forum. When the Ethereum ICO was held in 2014, funds were raised at a ratio of 2,000 ETH per BTC. It’s also easy to forget that many of the use cases now synonymous with Ethereum have Bitcoin ancestors, such as NFT precursor Colored Coins. Even the concept of a Layer 2 has Bitcoin beginnings. But all that’s ancient history now. BTC has assumed the mantle of store of value and global reserve currency, while ETH has become the fuel that launched 100 EVM chains and 10,000 tokens. Along the way, the continental drift pushing the two ecosystems apart has been expedited by Ethereum’s move to Proof of Stake, leaving Bitcoin as the only top 20 coin aside from DOGE still wedded to Proof of Work. While the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum are stark, they are not irreconcilable. One of the most fascinating aspects of the chains’ evolving use cases is the way in which each has emulated the other. Ethereum is well on its way to becoming a somewhat stable store of value of its own, and looks poised to follow Bitcoin in receiving an ETF. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has belatedly spawned its own multi-chain and multi-token ecosystem thanks to Ordinals, BRC20, Runes, Stacks, and similar protocols. Bitcoin-native DeFi and NFTs are now a thing – even if most maximalists aren’t on board. While it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin DeFi takes off, it’s clear that there’s now more that unites the two chains than divides them. Bitcoin and Ethereum have moved in opposing directions over the years but their paths are finally starting to converge. Choose Tech, Not Tribalism Rather than arguing over whose tech trumps whose, or who implemented it first, there are clear benefits to the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities setting aside their differences. Just as globalism diminished petty tribalism (even if we simply swapped hating the guy in the next valley for hating internet strangers), the multi-chain era has rendered blockchain wars pointless. Bitcoin and Ethereum are no longer isolated islands but interconnected hubs that routinely exchange value through bridges, portals, and wrappers. Isn’t it time they started swapping developer talent too? The onus is on builders to find ways that both technology stacks can enhance one another. This is the key to scaling web3 and growing adoption. The rise of Ordinals has shown there is strong interest in utilizing the Bitcoin network as more than simply a means to store value. But building out further utility natively is complex since the network is not Turing complete by nature and its simplistic UTXO model and limited block space cannot handle complex data and calculations. While there have been many avenues explored for scaling Bitcoin, they all relied on a level of centralization until the Taproot upgrade which brought Schnorr Signature and MAST contracts. These upgrades have made it possible to design fully trustless bridges between the Bitcoin ecosystem and other networks, allowing for truly decentralized scaling solutions to be realized. The Ethereum ecosystem is already home to a robust suite of tools, smart contracts and applications that can be utilized to bring further compatibility and functionality to Bitcoin. It makes far more sense for Bitcoin to inherit the technology that already exists for certain functions rather than rebuild them from the ground up. Scale Bitcoin, Enhance Ethereum An obvious solution to scaling Bitcoin at the consumer level and building out new use cases is to utilize the functionality enabled by Taproot to create trustless bridges between Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks. This can create a wave of new opportunities for both ecosystems by unlocking new ways for Bitcoin holders to engage while increasing the liquidity within Ethereum-based chains. While the possibility of utilizing EVM-compatible technology to scale the Bitcoin ecosystem is promising, perhaps the biggest challenge to overcome will not be technological but cultural. While human ingenuity is boundless, our tendency to drag one another down like a bucket of crabs remains deeply ingrained. All crypto communities should strive to shun the cutthroat behaviors web2 was built on and find ways to collaborate. Only once this is done can web3 realize its full potential.

Tron Sees Rising Bearishness Tron’s price noted a successful rally from early January to February end which flipped into corrections starting March. The onslaught of red candlesticks resulted in TRX falling by 21%, with another bout of declines noted in the past week. Based on the price action, TRX will likely endure further losses owing to the formation of Death Cross on the daily chart. A Death Cross occurs when a short-term 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses below a long-term 200-day EMA, signaling potential bearish sentiment in the market. Tron Death Cross.

TRX Price Prediction: Two Crucial Levels Tron’s price trading at $0.109 has already lost the support of the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement of $0.152 to $0.050. The altcoin is now hovering above the 50% Fib line marked at $0.101. Looking at the market and investor cues, this support will likely be broken, and TRX could fall to $0.089.

The post Q1 2024 Highlights: Bitcoin ETF, Ethereum Restaking, Solana Meme Coins appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"The crypto market ignited in the first quarter of 2024, with the total market capitalization exploding by 64.5%. Amid this surge, detailed in CoinGecko’s “2024 Q1 Crypto Industry Report,” certain altcoins dramatically outperformed Bitcoin (BTC). While Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $73,737 in March, some popular altcoins posted even more impressive gains. This insight and other crypto market developments reveal potential hidden gems for investors seeking dynamic opportunities. Altcoins Dazzle and Meme Coin Frenzy in Q1 2024 The approval of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January ignited the market. By April 2, these ETFs amassed over $55 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite the boost from ETFs, Bitcoin’s price gains were only at 69% during the first quarter. However, Solana (SOL) and Maker (MKR) managed to steal the spotlight, skyrocketing by 100% and 132%, respectively. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, also saw a relatively moderate price increase compared with Solana. In the previous quarter, ETH only managed to record a surge of 60%.

Source: CoinGecko However, its layer-2 (L2) networks flourished thanks to the gas fee reductions implemented by EIP-4844. As a result, these L2s processed over $900 million in transactions during the reporting period. Besides the L2s boom, Ethereum also recorded amazing achievements from its restaking sector. In Q1 2024, restaking on EigenLayer saw an increase of 36%, with a total of 4.3 million ETH being restaked. The majority of restaked ETH was held by Liquid Restaking Protocols (LRTs), which amounted to 2.28 million ETH. EtherFi was the most prominent LRT protocol in Q1, with a 21% market share. It experienced a massive growth of 2,616% throughout the quarter and held 910,000 ETH by the end of March. On the other hand, the surge of meme coins significantly impacted Solana‘s performance. During Q1, the market cap of the top 10 Solana meme coins skyrocketed by over 800%. By the end of March, these assets reached a staggering total market cap of $9.36 billion. “Of the top 10 Solana memecoins, only Bonk (BONK) and Samoyedcoin (SAMO) existed prior to Q4 2023. BONK, the number one meme coin on Solana since its launch in December 2022, was flipped by dogwifhat (WIF) in early March. WIF was launched in November 2023. Meanwhile, Book Of Memes (BOME) launched on March 14, reaching a $1 billion market cap within two days,” CoinGecko wrote. In addition to the crypto market, the non-fungible token (NFT) sector recovered in the previous quarter, buoyed by revived attention to Bitcoin and Solana NFTs. Ethereum recovered its spot as the largest NFT chain, with over $2.2 billion in trade during that period. However, the interest surge within the Bitcoin and Solana ecosystems challenges Ethereum’s dominance. Previously, BeInCrypto reported that in April 2024, Bitcoin Ordinals, the NFTs in Bitcoin’s blockchain, had outperformed Ethereum NFTs multiple times regarding sales value. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and launch of the new Runes token standard could heighten the competition. Read more: Bitcoin Halving Countdown Investor enthusiasm was further reflected in centralized exchange (CEX) spot trading volume, which hit $4.29 trillion in Q1 2024. This marks the highest recorded level since late 2021. However, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) saw Ethereum’s share of trading volume decline, with chains like Arbitrum and Solana gaining attention.

The post Worldcoin Introduces World Chain Layer-2 Amidst Regulatory Spotlight appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"Despite facing controversies and regulatory scrutiny, Worldcoin, a crypto project co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, announced the introduction of its layer-2 (L2) solution named World Chain on April 17, 2024. This move follows Worldcoin reaching 10 million users for its World App wallet a week ago. World Chain Claims to Prioritize Scalability and Humans World Chain, built on OP Stack and the Ethereum network, aims to address Web3 scalability challenges. This L2 solution will launch this summer. Worldcoin claims that the network will be “open to everyone.” Moreover, it also promises that “verified humans, including more than five million verified World ID holders, will get priority blockspace over bots & a gas allowance for casual transactions.” The network will integrate closely with the Worldcoin protocol to drive growth and utilize World ID’s Proof of Personhood system. Read more: What Is Worldcoin? A Guide to the Iris-Scanning Crypto Project Regarding World Chain’s announcement, Alex Blania, CEO of Tools for Humanity (the entity behind Worldcoin), took his excitement to X (formerly Twitter). “While still early, five million people have already verified with the Orb, and over 10 million accounts have been created. To continue accelerating, Worldcoin will launch a blockchain that can eventually support every human,” Blania said. World Chain is designed to prioritize scalability, significantly increasing the L2 block gas limit. Worldcoin users’ transactions currently represent about 44% of OP Mainnet’s activity, sometimes exceeding 80% during spikes. Worldcoin believes a core issue is the prevalence of bots on blockchains. It estimates up to 80% of blockchain transactions are automated. While many bots serve legitimate purposes, unproductive ones often lead to congested networks and high fees. Ironically, this problem worsens as blockchains optimize for low gas fees and high throughput. “Bad bots like airdrop farmers worsen many of the problems blockchains face today. People on the World Chain will have the option to anonymously verify their addresses as human with a World ID fully delinked from their ID, simply like a blue checkmark,” Tiago Sada, Head of Product at Worldcoin, explained. Besides ETH, Worldcoin said that World Chain users can easily pay fees using WLD. Interestingly, the price performance of Worldcoin’s native token, WLD, was modest after the announcement went live. WLD is trading at $4.83 at the time of writing, representing a 2.39% decrease in the last 24 hours. Read more: Worldcoin (WLD) Price Prediction 2024/2025/2030 Worldcoin (WLD) Price Performance.

The Ministry of Production, Science, and Technological Innovation of Buenos Aires province recently issued an indictment against Worldcoin after detecting allegedly abusive clauses in user contracts. The company could face a fine of up to 1 billion Argentine pesos ($1.2 million). Buenos Aires authorities assert that the company is liable for the penalty. Besides Buenos Aires, Worldcoin has faced scrutiny from jurisdictions like Spain and Kenya.

Easy, secure transfers in a familiar chat interface. Fintopio’s DeFi Wallet, now available in its beta version, lets users send and receive digital assets via Telegram. With the beta debut of its DeFi Wallet, Fintopio begins its journey to redefine payments by leveraging messaging apps and user-friendly design. Web3 company Fintopio recently introduced the beta version of its Fintopio DeFi Wallet. This wallet, available via Telegram bot and web app, empowers users to send and receive digital assets through the popular messaging app Telegram. The release marks an important milestone in Fintopio’s emergence as a game-changer in digital assets transaction operations. The company is also working on a mobile app version of the Fintopio DeFi Wallet that will run on both iOS and Android devices. The newly announced DeFi Wallet by Fintopio enables users to transfer cryptocurrencies to each other via Telegram. With a reported 900 million active users per month, Telegram is a convenient and widespread channel for this type of transaction. The DeFi wallet provides quick crypto asset exchange, smooth connection with different DeFi apps and wallets, and full user custody of funds. Steve Milton, the co-founder and CEO of Fintopio, stated: “There are a lot of untapped opportunities related to integrating convenient payment options in messaging apps, especially given that these are some of the world’s most widely and frequently used services. At Fintopio, we want to unlock this huge potential with solutions that allow people to send money just like sending a message or an emoji.” Steve Milton, a seasoned business executive who was once a top manager at BNB Chain and Binance, leads Fintopio in steering the revolution of crypto payment methods. The Fintopio team consists of 20 people with high levels of expertise in Web3, cryptocurrency, technology, and finance. They are united by the idea of rethinking payment transactions and making Fintopio a high-impact global financial solutions company for regular customers and enterprises. A revolutionary way to pay for digital assets through Telegram The Fintopio DeFi Wallet, built on top of Telegram and also available via web app, allows users to perform all crypto transactions within the platform Telegram. With Fintopio, in-app messages can act as transactions, eliminating the need for recipients to grapple with the complexities of digital asset management. “Telegram has a great combination of market size and growth trajectory. Even at its current reach, it’s still one of the most downloaded apps worldwide. And it has a young, tech-adept demographic, with 30.6% of its users being in the 25-34 age bracket, making it an ideal foundation upon which we can grow Fintopio especially in a crowded crypto payments space,” according to Steve Milton. Unlike other DeFi wallets, Fintopio positions user-friendly interfaces and intuitive design as its top priority. This approach allows Fintopio to address head-on the ongoing challenge of making crypto easier and more convenient to use while maintaining the safety of users’ funds. The Fintopio app makes sending digital assets as easy as sending a text. Users can easily import their assets from other wallets or quickly set up their non-custodial wallet through Telegram. The Future of Crypto Payments Fintopio recognizes the complexity of modern digital payment systems and sees a growing necessity for innovative approaches in this domain. According to the latest projections, cashless transactions are estimated to grow to 1.9 trillion by 2025 and up to triple that number by 2032. Major social media platforms and messaging platforms’ integration of payment capabilities show that messaging will be crucial in future developments of fintech solutions and cryptocurrency. “Ultimately, what we’re doing with the beta launch of the Fintopio DeFi Wallet is an opening act that demonstrates what’s possible with messaging-based, convenient crypto payments, as well as what we can build further. Once the Fintopio infrastructure for simple payments through chat apps is built, and it shows significant traction, this innovation will be easier to replicate as a viable payment solution for other major messaging and social media apps. At that point, it’s not that big a leap to take,” Steve Milton said. In the first phase of their DeFi Wallet beta starting program, Fintopio is implementing a beta test exercise. The exact process includes reaching out to the Fintopio community and inviting them to inform them of the bugs they encountered or provide them with their recommendations for improvement. In exchange, participants have a chance to gain rewards. Users can try the beta version of the Fintopio DeFi Wallet through this Telegram bot. People willing to be part of the Finitopia Beta Program can give their opinions and comments by filling in the Bug Bounty form. About Fintopio Fintopio is one of the leading software companies that deals with developing modern technologies for distributing crypto-assets.

The post BlackRock Was Tipped Off About High Inflation, Uses Bitcoin to Hedge appeared first on BeInCrypto.","article_detailed_content":"Amid escalating inflation concerns, BlackRock, a leader in asset management, is shifting focus to Bitcoin as a hedge. This strategy follows reports that an economist from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shared privileged inflation data with top Wall Street firms, including BlackRock. BlackRock Received Inflation Data in Advance Bloomberg obtained records showing frequent communications from the BLS economist about US inflation, specifically within the shelter and used cars categories of the consumer price index (CPI). These exchanges reveal that the economist gave detailed insights to a select group he called “my super users.” “This info gave traders a massive edge on their bets. How is this not insider trading?,” X account Insider Tracker said. The discovery of these communications has sparked investigations into their potential impact on asset trading and Federal Reserve policies. In response, Emily Liddel, BLS Associate Commissioner for Publications and Special Studies, emphasized the agency’s commitment to fairness. “Obviously this has been an embarrassment for the agency. The public puts a lot of trust in us to be fair, and our data providers put a lot of trust in us for the data to be secure. It’s our goal to repair that trust.” Liddel explained. Read more: How to Protect Yourself From Inflation Using Cryptocurrency In the wake of these disclosures, BlackRock has been particularly proactive with its bullish stance on Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s limited supply and decentralization make it appealing as an inflation hedge. Following the International Monetary Fund’s recent caution about US fiscal deficits, which they claim are stoking inflation and posing global risks, this strategy gains importance. BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, recently shared his positive outlook on Bitcoin. “I’m very bullish on the long term viability of Bitcoin. That surprised me how much that’s gone up. We are creating now a market that has more liquidity, more transparency, and I’m pleasantly surprised and I would have never predicted it before we filed it, that we were going to see this type of retail demand,” Fink said. This optimistic view is reflected in the performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which accumulated over $15.3 billion, marking it as the fastest-growing Bitcoin ETF.

Despite a slowdown, with a record low inflow of $18.1 million this Wednesday since its January 2024 inception, the ETF’s success signifies a shift in investor preferences amid financial uncertainty.

The collaboration seeks to make it easy for millions to access dApps via the Jambophone. Injective and Web3 mobile infrastructure platform Jambo have announced a partnership that will see the two companies collaborate to bring blockchain-powered financial solutions to millions of users in emerging markets. The partnership will tap into JamboPhone, a Web3 Android 13 smartphone, to introduce users across Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia to Injective’s DeFi ecosystem. “Combining Injective’s robust infrastructure stack with Jambo’s mature Web3 mobile technology will enable us to efficiently scale DeFi to the point where it can tangibly help billions of people overcome socioeconomic hurdles,” Mirza Uddin, head of business at Injective Labs said in an announcement. As part of the collaboration, users in these emerging markets will access multiple decentralised applications (dApps) in the Injective ecosystem via JamboPlay dApp store. One of the first platforms to be available will be Ninji, a native Injective wallet. “We want to bring emerging markets on-chain,” James Zhang, co-founder of Jambo, noted. Web3 phone for DeFi adoption JamboPhone is currently priced at $99 and has been sold in more than 100 countries.

The Shiba Inu community has burnt over 774 million tokens in the past week. NuggetRush’s crypto mining game integrates NFTs with blockchain gaming. Despite a 21.8% price drop over the last week, investors remain hopeful that the new update will resolve network congestion on the Solana network. The update is expected to bring a positive turnaround in the market for SOL. At the same time, the Shiba Inu community has burned over 774 million tokens in just one week. NuggetRush, meanwhile, has integrated some of the best NFTs into their new crypto mining game. The target is to offer its users a real-world gaming experience. NuggetRush (NUGX) raises excitement in the gaming space with NFTs NuggetRush (NUGX) is building a platform where players can assemble the best mining team to explore and mine precious minerals like gold, silver, and diamond. The platform has trending NFTs, which have different users on its gaming platform. Firstly, these NFTs serve as the characters of players and give them unique abilities. These unique abilities – speed, mining knowledge, and lots more add fun to the game, making it interesting. In addition to the NFTs acting as characters, there are some rare NFTs called RUSHGEMs. Fans have described them as the coolest NFTs, as they can be exchanged for real gold, making them one of the most searched NFTs in the game. Lastly, NFTs can be staked to receive a passive income of up to 20% APY. The amount earned as passive income will depend on the amount of stake and the duration of the stake. Whichever is the case, NuggetRush’s NFTs are being hailed by some as the best NFTs to invest in. The NuggetRush airdrop for its NUGX token is less than a week from now, and investors are excited. The NUGX token, which will be listed at $0.020, could rise 50x after its listing this quarter, according to some chartists. Solana (SOL) price drops to lows at $120 Solana (SOL) price has been on a steep decline in the past week, dropping 21.8% to $124.69. The “Ethereum killer” was greatly affected by the latest bear market and issues of failed transactions on its network. Meanwhile, Anza, the development team behind Solana, has launched a new update, v1.17.31, to solve the issue of network congestion. While this is not a major fix, the team said it would release other updates to complete the issue. With this update, we should see positive momentum returning to the Solana ecosystem in the coming days. If this happens, bulls could take SOL to the long-awaited $250 mark. Shiba Inu (SHIB) community burns 774M SHIB Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a rapid increase in its token burn rates. Data from Shibburn shows that over 774 million SHIB tokens were burnt in the last week. This is an increase of nearly 200%. Despite this uptick in burn rates, the circulating supply of the meme coin still stands at 582.80 trillion SHIB. Additionally, Shiba Inu, like many other top altcoins, is still trading in losses. The coin’s price has gone down 24.0% in the past week. Its price could increase in the coming days if positive momentum returns to the market. Final thoughts Solana investors are expecting the new update to bring a positive wave to the SOL token. On the other hand, Shiba Inu’s massive token burn did not affect its price. Meanwhile, NuggetRush’s introduction of NFTs to its game makes its native token one of the best altcoins to watch.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world’s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui’s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. “In building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,” said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. “Less than a year after launching Sui’s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui’s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui’s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.” The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry — the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui’s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui’s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui’s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui’s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui’s arrival. “The overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui’s potential to make people’s lives better,” said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. “In the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui’s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.” Users can read more on the event on the Sui Blog.

BONK slumps 32% in a week, but analysts foresee a resurgence by month’s end. Rebel Satoshi’s $RECQ attracts more investors after surging 85% during its presale. Top crypto coins like Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) have recorded double-digit losses over the second week of April as the crypto market continues bleeding. As a result, a growing number of investors are migrating to Rebel Satoshi’s $RECQ token, which has surged 85% so far during its ongoing public presale. Why is $RECQ outpacing popular cryptos like SUI and BONK? Continue reading to find out. SUI plummets 33% in a week: will bulls resurface soon? SUI has performed deplorably over the past seven days. On April 7, SUI was changing hands at around $1.65. After a day of range-bound trading, the token rose slightly on April 8 following the announcement of Suilend completing its beta phase, becoming publicly available. Notably, Suilend hit a $30 million TVL during its beta phase, which started on March 11. This news saw SUI jump to as high as $1.72 on April 9. However, the excitement about this news cooled off, and the price began correcting downward. By April 14, the token had stabilized at around $1.10. This price means SUI has shed 33.33% in a week and the subpar performance explains why many investors are abandoning the token. Still, some experts believe SUI will overcome the current bearish trend and climb to $1.91 by the end of April. This forecast could make SUI a good crypto to buy now. Experts base this prediction on SUI gaining more adoption as more Web3 gamers line up to purchase the SuiPlay0X1 handheld gaming device, which SUI introduced on April 10. BONK wipes off 32% in a week: will bears persist? BONK has performed abysmally over the past seven days. On April 7, BONK was hovering around $0.00002317. After a day of sideways trading, BONK gained traction on April 8 after AllDomains announced the number of registered .LetsBONK domain names had exceeded 10,000. This milestone saw BONK jump as high as $0.00002452 on April 8. BONK held this level for a day before the excitement about AllDomain news faded. Consequently, BONK began retracing its growth. By April 14, BONK had leveled off at around $0.00001561. This price means SUI has plunged 32.63% in a week. This lackluster performance has left investors asking, is BONK a top crypto to invest in? According to some experts, BONK could reverse course and jump to $0.00001800 by the end of April. Experts base this prediction on BONK gaining more adoption after the BONK team announced that BONK adopters had locked over 3 trillion BONK on ArmadaFi as of April 12. Rebel Satoshi’s $RECQ steals the show after jumping 85% Rebel Satoshi, an upcoming meme coin project, has emerged as the latest sensation in the crypto industry due to its mission to fight centralization. Investors are buzzing about Rebel Satoshi because its mission entails uniting the silent majority and building a vibrant community that champions decentralization. A number of analysts have suggested Rebel Satoshi might be the best ICO to invest in right now because it boasts two tokens, namely $RBLZ and $RECQ. $RBLZ is Rebel SatoshI’s governance and membership token, while $RECQ is its base currency. Interestingly, $RBLZ rewarded Early Bird Round investors of its presale with a 150% ROI. As of April, $RBLZ was available on Coinstore, CoinGecko, Uniswap, and DEXTools. On the other hand, $RECQ had kickstarted Stage 1 of its ongoing public presale. During this round, investors can purchase $RECQ at $0.0037. This price denotes an 85% surge from the Early Bird Round $RECQ price of $0.0020. It is worth pointing out that Rebel Satoshi has set $RECQ’s launch price at $0.0125. When $RECQ attains this price, Early Bird Round investors will get a 525% ROI, while Stage 1 investors will enjoy an ROI of 237.84%.

The company has a new and fresh perspective on how to match high-potential influencers and KOLs with respective crypto projects and investors in a lucrative, scalable, and secure way. SeedHunter launched on April 18th 2024, its debut service: The Marketing Module. This is a platform that allows crypto projects to manage and maintain their influencer marketing campaigns more efficiently, securely, and effectively. The marketing campaigns launched can be uniquely customized to the crypto project’s needs in terms of content, deliverables, and more. The platform then uses an AI-based data model to evaluate, rate, and match reliable KOLs to crypto projects. SeedHunter will also assess influencer performance and define pricing directly using an advanced algorithm based on metrics of engagement, impression rates, number of followers, and the compatibility of the KOL with the campaign they manage – all of these standards will ensure that the right influencer is matched to the user’s target audience needs. This ensures a fully transparent, fair, and lucrative influencer marketing position for influencers of all kinds.

The discussion provided an in-depth look at the anticipated developments and strategic directions for the crypto industry in the upcoming year. Vugar Usi Zade highlighted the critical importance of prioritizing end-user experiences and privacy, drawing lessons from historical challenges such as the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data scandal. He stressed the necessity for industry leaders to work closely with regulators to enhance user protection without stifling innovation. “Our goal is to ensure that legislation supports the growth of blockchain technologies rather than hindering it,” Usi Zade noted. “As key players, centralized exchanges should work with legislators and educate them on how blockchain technology works and how introducing legislation should help the end user.” Addressing the infrastructure of the gig economy and energy sectors, Usi Zade shared insights about Bitget’s initiatives to support the integration of blockchain technologies in various industries. “We are particularly excited about our projects that give NFTs a second chance and promote sustainable energy practices among communities,” he added. A significant focus for Bitget in the coming years, as outlined by Usi Zade, will be on developing and nurturing talent within the blockchain sector. He emphasized the company’s commitment to invest in entrepreneurial innovation on its platform. “We believe in empowering new talent to build and develop rather than trying to do everything ourselves,” he explained. “There are so many opportunities, and we need so much talent, for the entire economy and industry. In the next two years, we will invest as many resources as possible to develop talent.” With an exemplary track record of safety, Bitget underscores its pledge to user security through substantial financial safeguards, including a robust protection fund. “We maintain a 200% proof of reserve, ensuring that funds remain secure even if all users withdraw their assets simultaneously.” Usi Zade asserted. “We have security measures in place, but in case something goes wrong, we have an insured Protection Fund to make sure that there are no customers suffering at the other end.” The Bitget COO emphasized that its Protection Fund is one of the largest in the industry, providing an additional layer of security against potential breaches. Usi Zade also discussed the role of centralized exchanges in facilitating access to the crypto market. He described how Bitget has simplified the transition for users from traditional finance to cryptocurrencies through user-friendly services like social logins and comprehensive customer support. The COO concluded his talk by touching upon the regulatory challenges and the potential of decentralized exchanges to evolve further. “As legislation in Europe begins to affect how users can transact with non-KYC wallets, centralized exchanges will need to adapt. However, this also presents an opportunity to redefine our roles, potentially acting as intermediaries in large B2B transactions,” he speculated. The panel discussion at Blockchain Life Week 2024 provided much-needed insights into the crypto industry’s expected trajectory. It also reinforced Bitget’s position as a leader prepared to navigate and shape the future landscape of digital currencies. About Bitget Established in 2018, Bitget is the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange that offers Copy Trading services as one of its key features.

The digital euro, as envisioned by the Bundesbank and DCI, aims to be different. It aspires to be a digital cash equivalent, offering the same level of anonymity associated with physical currency. This doesn't mean a free-for-all for money launderers and rogue states. The Bundesbank assures us that safeguards will be in place, with potential holding limits on digital euro accounts to prevent financial shenanigans. But why rock the boat? Why tinker with a system, albeit one with privacy concerns, that seems to be working well enough? The answer lies in the shifts transforming the financial ecosystem. As Nagel aptly points out, \"German bank cards, for example, don't always work in other euro area countries.\" This lack of seamless integration within a supposedly unified currency zone highlights the limitations of the current system. A digital euro, built on robust and secure technology, has the potential to streamline cross-border transactions, fostering a more efficient and inclusive financial ecosystem. Additionally, it could act as a bulwark against the rising tide of private digital currencies like Facebook's Diem (now Meta Diem).

The motivations vary, but the undercurrent of concern about privacy and the future of money is undeniable. This digital currency revolution, however, is not without its skeptics. Some fear that CBDCs could destabilize the financial system by encouraging citizens to bypass traditional banks and park their money directly with the central bank. Others worry about the potential for government overreach, with the ability to track and potentially control spending habits. The road ahead for the digital euro is long and winding. Public education and open dialogue will be crucial in addressing these concerns and ensuring widespread adoption.

The era of opaque interest rates, surprise fees, and the ever-present threat of late payment penalties might be nearing its end. At least, that's the promise Klarna is making with its US debut of the Klarna Card, a new financial instrument aiming to be the smarter, smoother way to shop and pay. Klarna, the Swedish buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) giant, has already carved a niche for itself in the payments industry. Their model lets consumers split purchases into installments, typically interest-free, offering a more controlled alternative to traditional credit cards. Now, with the Klarna Card, they're taking things a step further. This physical and virtual Visa card integrates seamlessly with the Klarna app, allowing users to not only manage payments but also shop for the best deals and track spending in one centralized location. But what truly sets the Klarna Card apart is its commitment to transparency. No more buried fees lurking in the fine print – Klarna boasts zero annual fees, no monthly fees, and even waives foreign transaction fees for international purchases. This focus on upfront clarity is a welcome change in an industry notorious for its hidden costs. The traditional credit card model has long been criticized for its tendency to encourage impulsive spending and rack up debt. Klarna counters this by promoting responsible financial behavior. The Klarna Card operates on a debit system, meaning users can only spend what they have available. Additionally, it offers a variety of flexible payment options, empowering users to choose how they want to manage their purchases. They can opt to pay their statement in full each month to avoid interest charges, make early payments to chip away at larger purchases, or split eligible transactions into 3 or 6 installments with interest. This level of control allows users to tailor their repayment strategy to their unique financial situation. This focus on responsible spending is underscored by Klarna's data. They report that a significantly lower percentage of their BNPL users incur late fees compared to traditional credit card users. This suggests that the Klarna model, with its emphasis on transparency and control, might be nudging users towards healthier financial habits. Of course, the Klarna Card isn't a magic bullet. Approval requires meeting eligibility criteria, including a credit check. For those who qualify, however, the Klarna Card presents a compelling alternative. It offers the convenience and security of a traditional credit card, with the added benefits of transparency, flexibility, and the potential for rewards through the Klarna app. The Klarna Card's arrival in the US throws down a gauntlet to established credit card companies. Consumers are increasingly demanding more from their financial tools, and Klarna is stepping up to deliver. Whether this new entrant will disrupt the status quo remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Klarna Card injects a dose of competition into the payments industry, which can only benefit consumers seeking smarter ways to manage their money.

On April 8th, 2024, a seemingly mundane transaction – a payment between two major banks – marked a turning point for the CHIPS network, the world's largest private-sector high-value clearing and settlement system. This wasn't just another transfer of funds; it was the first payment conducted using the ISO 20022 messaging format, a standardized language poised to streamline the symphony of international finance. For decades, the CHIPS network, the dominant player in US dollar clearing, relied on a system that, while efficient, lacked a certain fluency. Messages were akin to telegrams, conveying the bare essentials of a transaction – sender, receiver, amount. This functional minimalism served its purpose, but it also created limitations. Richer data, crucial for regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and even supply chain optimization, remained trapped within siloed systems. The ISO 20022 standard breaks down these communication barriers. With ISO 20022, payments become more than just the movement of money; they carry embedded information about invoices, customs declarations, and even the ultimate purpose of the funds. This newfound eloquence opens doors to a future of smoother, faster, and more transparent cross-border payments. And the benefits extend beyond mere efficiency: the standardized format fosters interoperability between the CHIPS network and other global systems, creating a more unified financial ecosystem. Think of it as the Rosetta Stone of finance, enabling previously disparate systems to converse seamlessly. This newfound harmony could lead to a reduction in processing errors, faster settlement times, and ultimately, a more cost-effective financial infrastructure. The adoption of ISO 20022 by CHIPS isn't just a technological upgrade; it's a strategic move. The world of finance is increasingly interconnected, and the US dollar remains a critical player on the global stage. By embracing this new standard, CHIPS positions itself as a leader in the evolution of international payments, ensuring its continued relevance in a rapidly changing landscape. Of course, this shift isn't without its challenges. Implementing a new messaging format across a vast network like CHIPS requires significant coordination and investment. Banks and other financial institutions need to adapt their systems and processes to accommodate the richer data exchange. But the potential rewards – faster transactions, improved transparency, and a more interconnected financial ecosystem – make the effort worthwhile. The successful completion of the first ISO 20022 payment on the CHIPS network is a testament to the collective effort of the financial industry. It's a symbol of progress, a step towards a future where international payments are conducted with the same ease and efficiency as domestic transactions.

This shift is not just altering market dynamics, it's laying the foundation for a more equitable and accessible financial future when empowerment and freedom aren't just ideals but tangible realities. Investing in Appreciating Assets - an Economic Necessity The ability to invest capital into assets, instead of holding cash, is not a luxury but a necessity for every household looking to survive and thrive. Holding cash, often perceived as a safe bet, is a silent thief eroded by the relentless march of inflation. Consider this, $100 in 2004, sitting idly, would have the purchasing power of merely $60 today. Contrast this, with the dynamism of the stock market the same amount invested in the S&P 500 over the same period would have quintupled to an impressive $470.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world’s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui’s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. Sui Basecamp attendees from 65 countries had the opportunity to meet each other face-to-face. “In building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,” said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. “Less than a year after launching Sui’s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui’s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui’s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.” The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry — the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui (https://sui.io/) is an industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui’s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui’s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui’s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui’s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui’s arrival. “The overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui’s potential to make people’s lives better,\" said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. “In the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui’s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.” This article was written by FM Contributors at www.financemagnates.com.","article_detailed_content":"Over 1,000 projects, partners, investors, and enthusiasts from 65 countries around the world gathered last week in Paris to celebrate Sui at the vaunted Layer 1’s inaugural global Sui Basecamp conference.

There is no point in having a fast solution if, on the receiving side or the issuing side, the quality of the exchange and the liquidity are not there.” He further believes there will be “challenges in the coming years around interconnectivity of clearing systems.” “The interconnectivity of major clearing systems, and in some cases more local ones, will drive a lot of changes because it's becoming more and more doable to collect monies somewhere and pay somewhere else.

We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.” “AI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds.

And, according to Descout, AI is “already transforming” the payments industry. “The main advantage of AI now is going to be on the compliance side of things,” he said. “We are, as a payment company, bound by strict regulations. We are required to collect more and more information as a payment institution to analyze more and more information on payment changes, which are complex as sometimes we don't even see the entire payment change.” “AI is bringing a lot of analytics capabilities, and we can look at thousands of transactions and spot anomalies, which may trigger some questioning or some analysis all in a couple of seconds. AI is definitely going to transform the compliance side of our business, making payments quicker and services better.” This article was written by Arnab Shome at www.financemagnates.com.","category":["Interviews","Executives"]},{"_id":"66213d8485af1d249d130cc5","guid":"https://www.financemagnates.com//thought-leadership/tanssi-foundation-announces-lets-forkin-dance","article_link":"https://www.financemagnates.com//thought-leadership/tanssi-foundation-announces-lets-forkin-dance/","website_source":"financemagnates","_type":"article","article_title":"Tanssi Foundation Announces 'Let’s Forkin' Dance'","author":"FM Contributors","creation_date":"2024-04-18T13:39:06Z","thumbnail_image":null,"article_summary":"The Tanssi Foundation, a key contributor to the development of Tanssi's community and ecosystem, has unveiled \"Let’s Forkin' Dance,\" the Tanssi Incentivized TestNet campaign. This initiative is designed to incentivize participants and propel community growth and network activity in preparation for the upcoming Tanssi Network launch later this year. Backed by leading investors like Arrington Capital, HashKey Capital, Fenbushi, Borderless, The Wormhole Cross-Chain Fund, KR1, YBB, SNZ Capital, and Scytale Digital, alongside angel investors such as Gavin Wood, Tanssi is at the forefront of reinventing the deployment of application-specific blockchains (appchains).

Tanssi's protocol aims to simplify this process to just a few clicks, significantly reducing deployment times from months to minutes. In just six months since its launch, Dancebox, Tanssi's TestNet, has supported over 700 appchain deployments in fields such as DeFi, NFTs, real-world assets, and gaming, showing rapid market adoption.

The Tanssi Incentivized TestNet – Pathway to Mainnet Success Community-named \"Let’s Forkin' Dance\" (LFD) introduces a dynamic mix of on-chain and off-chain challenges designed to engage a broad spectrum of the ecosystem—from builders and casual users to key network supporters. This initiative not only celebrates community involvement but also equips participants with practical, hands-on experience in Tanssi’s environment ahead of the official mainnet launch.

Additionally, the platform decided to introduce enhanced precautionary measures to combat future attacks or issues. \"We've enhanced our protections, so you may encounter additional verification checks,\" it explained. \"This means you might notice a few extra human verification checks during your use.\" From MetaTrader to TradeLocker It's worth recalling that Funding Pips was one of the first prop trading firms that suspended its operations in February after Blackbull Markets terminated its agreement with the prop trading firm as MetaQuotes forced the broker into this situation. A week later, the company was back on its feet after a quick migration to the Match-Trader platform. It informed US traders in early March to \"stay tuned for a major comeback.\" This comeback was made possible by adding the TradeLocker platform.

Our developers successfully resolved this issue and you were able to continue your trading activities. This attack impacted accessibility for some users across our demo… — TradeLocker (@tradelockermain) April 18, 2024 The company added that the attack affected the ability to access demo and live accounts for \"some users,\" but all pending orders were operational, so \"the SL&TPs\" were being executed. Additionally, the platform decided to introduce enhanced precautionary measures to combat future attacks or issues. \"We've enhanced our protections, so you may encounter additional verification checks,\" it explained. \"This means you might notice a few extra human verification checks during your use.\" From MetaTrader to TradeLocker It's worth recalling that Funding Pips was one of the first prop trading firms that suspended its operations in February after Blackbull Markets terminated its agreement with the prop trading firm as MetaQuotes forced the broker into this situation. A week later, the company was back on its feet after a quick migration to the Match-Trader platform. It informed US traders in early March to \"stay tuned for a major comeback.\" This comeback was made possible by adding the TradeLocker platform.

UK Retail Investors Rely on Own Research over Advisors, Survey Finds According to Capital.com findings, only 10% of traders and investors rely on financial advisors for investment direction, while 11% turn to social media platforms, influencers, or renowned investors like Warren Buffett for tips and inspiration. When asked about their most frequently used trading and investment research resources, 21% of respondents cited news articles, while 28% relied on investing websites and platforms to generate trading ideas. An earlier survey from last year examined when investors are most active. According to its findings, 35% of traders prefer the first hour of the trading day for executing trades. This is closely followed by 30% who favor the last hour. The least popular time is after lunch but before the last hour, with only 16% of traders opting for this period. Growth and Tech Stocks in Focus Despite the current high-interest rate environment and sluggish economic conditions, the survey indicates a strong interest in growth and tech stocks for the coming year. 28% of respondents plan to trade or invest in growth stocks, followed by tech (25%) and value stocks (22%). Kyle Rodda, the Senior Market Analyst at Capital.com, attributed the interest in growth and tech stocks to the artificial intelligence boom, driving bullish sentiment and risk-taking among investors. \"In addition to the hype surrounding AI mania across the tech sector, investor interest in growth stocks was, for a while, also driven by rate cut expectations,\" Rodda added. Notably, the survey suggests that UK traders and investors are losing interest in meme stocks, with only 4% of respondents likely to trade them this year. Another study by Capital.com from last June revealed that traders who diversify their portfolios and hold positions for longer durations typically experience higher profitability. In contrast, those concentrating on a single market or close positions quickly often achieve less success. Sectors to Watch in 2024 UK traders and investors closely monitor several sectors for potential investment or trading opportunities in 2024. These include technology (32%), energy (30%), financials (26%), metals and mining (15%), retail (11%), and automotive (8%). Rodda explained that the focus on energy and mining sectors is due to heightened geopolitical risks, such as rising tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, which have led traders to seek opportunities in volatile oil and natural gas markets. “Investors and traders have also tapped into gold as a hedge against the escalating geopolitical tensions,” said Rodda. In March, Capital.com announced that it was suspending the ability to create new accounts in the UK. A few weeks later, the company reported expanding its operations to the Middle East after obtaining a local license, which led to the opening of a regional office. The survey, commissioned by trading platform Capital.com and conducted by Find Out Now, polled 19,451 UK adults, including 2,036 traders and investors, between November 21 and December 4, 2023. Investors and traders were defined as adults who had invested or traded in various financial instruments within the past 12 months.

One of the fathers of the new business in the USA is Ingmar Mattus, the Co-Founder of the popular brokerage brand Tickmill. According to the information published yesterday, MetroTrade has just obtained registration with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an introducing broker and is a member of the National Futures Association (NFA). Now, Mattus has commented on the introducing broker's plans for future operations. Mattus Launches MetroTrade: US Futures and Options Brokerage Mattus is creating a new business in the USA alongside the other Co-Founder, David Klotz, and dedicated teams in Europe and North America. He admitted that his goal is to \"transform the US retail futures market\" by utilizing new technology and adapting to customer needs. \"Dave's extensive experience in the futures industry pairs perfectly with my own history of co-founding and building Tickmill into a global retail brokerage with licenses in six major financial centers and 100,000 clients,\" Mattus commented today on his LinkedIn profile. \"We're thrilled at the prospect of working together with our skilled team to achieve success.\" Although MetroTrade is just starting its operations, it has ambitious plans to establish partnerships with major players in the industry, including CME Group, regulated financial firms, and introducing brokers, influencing the development of the futures industry in the USA. MetroTrade is backed by Andromeda Capital Partners Suisse, a Swiss private equity firm that is also run by Mattus and known for investing in innovative fintech companies, such as AgenaTrader, TradersYard, and Change Securities. \"With backing from Andromeda's extensive portfolio of fintech companies, MetroTrade is poised to make a significant impact on the financial landscape,\" the Co-Founder of MetroTrade added. The company is set to launch its platform this summer, and it is currently expanding its team across multiple departments, including customer support, technology, and finance. As MetroTrade prepares for its launch, the company invites potential clients to join its waiting list for early access to the platform and its features. \"Retail traders deserve to have a variety of choices when it comes to their brokerage needs, and we are excited to meet and exceed those expectations,\" concluded Klotz. This is another important business move by Mattus after acquiring a 51% stake in the Amsterdam-based fintech company Change in September. Similar to his entry into the US market and the acquisition of a European tech firm, these moves were made in collaboration with Andromeda Capital Partners Suisse. This separate business entity, created by the founder of Tickmill, focuses on acquiring and expanding innovative companies. A Shift from CFDs to Futures Mattus's move doesn't appear to be a coincidence, especially when considering the latest data published by Acuiti regarding companies transitioning from the CFD sector to alternative instruments, such as futures and options. This shift can be attributed to the impact of regulations. According to the survey, more than 50 percent of European retail brokers want to offer futures and options as an alternative to retail over-the-counter instruments like CFDs. Moreover, recent disruptions in the prop trading industry have led to the emergence of futures prop trading platforms. On top of that, the survey revealed that 77 percent of European retail brokers are interested in expanding into other regions, as widespread restrictions are set to be enforced across the continent. Additionally, 69 percent of the respondents expressed their intention to expand into institutional markets. These findings suggest that the changing regulatory landscape is driving brokers to adapt their offerings and explore new markets to maintain their competitive edge and ensure long-term growth.

However, what many don’t understand is that artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT are only as good as the data they use and the questions, or instructions they’re given. This article is part of an ongoing series on prompt engineering and here, we take it to the next level with advanced techniques. The first article, and the online course that I’ve been taking, can be found here. Teach Me: The Art of Learning with ChatGPT If you’re seeking to expand your knowledge base or acquire new skills, you can benefit immensely from ChatGPT’s instructional capabilities. By requesting “step-by-step” instructions, users can access tailored educational content. For instance, asking, “Teach me, a complete beginner, about forex trading step-by-step,” prompts ChatGPT to generate a beginner-friendly guide to forex, that in turn can be useful in creating introductory texts for potential clients. Similarly, for lighthearted culinary enthusiasts, a prompt like “Teach me, an experienced cook, how to make spaghetti Bolognese” adjusts the complexity of the instructions based on the user’s expertise. The end result is a recipe that doesn’t state the basics, but rather operates at a higher level. Remember, the quality of ChatGPT’s responses can significantly improve through iteration. Initially, the AI might provide a basic overview, but by using the edit option (at the top, below your prompt) to refine your questions or add more specifics, the responses can become more detailed and tailored, making the learning process more effective and personalized. “Prompt engineering” is becoming a specialized skill all its own. https://t.co/DkL3k43WDl — WIRED (@WIRED) April 8, 2023 Write Like Me: Ensuring Consistency in Style For content creators and marketers, maintaining a consistent voice and style across all communications is crucial. ChatGPT can adapt to specific writing styles, making it an invaluable tool for creating content that aligns with your brand’s tone. To employ this feature, provide ChatGPT with examples of your or your company’s previous writings. For example, you could say, “Write me a social media post about our new product launch, using the style demonstrated in our recent posts,” and then copy-paste in some examples. This method not only saves time but also helps in keeping the brand’s narrative consistent without constant back and forth. Ask for Advice: Immediate Problem-Solving When facing challenges or needing quick decision-making support, ChatGPT can offer instant advice and multiple perspectives. By framing your problems in the form of a question, such as “I’m struggling with time management, what can I do to improve?” ChatGPT provides strategies and solutions that you can immediately implement or refine further. This interactive approach to problem-solving not only offers quick solutions but also encourages deeper exploration into the advice given, enhancing understanding and application. You can alter this slightly by asking for different perspectives on an issue, or tailor it further by saying “Acting as a productivity expert, tell me how I can improve my time management skills.” All these little tweaks can allow you to tailor your output. Laddering: Simplifying Complex Problems Complex problems require nuanced solutions, these can often be reached by breaking down the issue into manageable parts. ChatGPT can assist in this process through the laddering technique. When planning a social media campaign, for example, asking ChatGPT to “Break down the campaign planning into bullet points”. This helps organize the process into clear, actionable steps. Each point can then be expanded upon in subsequent queries, providing a structured approach to tackling intricate projects. Advanced Prompt Engineering: Fine-Tuning ChatGPT Once you’ve understood all this, and studied the previous articles, you can begin to combine the various techniques to fine-tune ChatGPT’s outputs. This involves using modifiers to tailor the complexity of the information, such as explaining concepts at an eighth-grade level, or varying the tone to match professional or casual settings or media. Remember, structuring prompts with specific instructions on content organization, such as “Start with an introduction, follow with detailed analysis, and conclude with bullet points,” can guide ChatGPT to produce outputs that require minimal editing. Conclusion: ChatGPT for Enhanced Productivity By mastering the art of prompt crafting, professionals can leverage ChatGPT to not only enhance their productivity but also ensure high-quality content creation. From learning new skills to maintaining brand consistency and solving complex problems, the versatility of ChatGPT is a serious asset. As we continue to integrate AI into our daily workflows, becoming proficient in interacting with these tools is not just beneficial—it’s essential for staying competitive and innovative in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Remember, the key to maximizing ChatGPT’s utility lies in the clarity and specificity of your prompts, so take the time to refine and iterate to see the best results. You might not get the perfect answer in 10 minutes, but if you manage it in an hour, then that’s still time well spent. For more finance adjacent pieces, check out our Trending section.
