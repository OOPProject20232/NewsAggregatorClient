Final Thought Meme coins have become the preferred cryptocurrencies these days because of their short-term gains. Meme coins grabbed the biggest gains this week despite the crypto market instability. This increased popularity has helped to improve the market cap for meme coins in general. The past few days have been perfect for the meme investors as the greedy sentiments helped the not-so-popular meme coins gain massive price rallies as well. This blog concluded the three less popular meme coins, MAGA VP, MANEKI, and Andy on SOL, which gained huge returns this week.

The UK government hopes to allocate big budgets to help transform the automotive industry, hoping for driverless vehicles on their roads in the future. Also read: AI-enabled robots for road repair in UK British Motorists\u2019 Negative Attitude to AI Vehicle System In a VWFS research undertaken on 2,078 motorists, a vast majority feel that Autonomous Vehicles may not respond faster than human drivers. Despite former Prime Minister Boris Johnson declaring his experience working with the self-driving mechanism of Tesla as positive, people are still quite skeptical regarding this technology. Also read: A Potential attack against AI-driven car systems According to the study, 39% of drivers were most concerned about technological failures, while 10% were worried about getting bored without actively driving. However, 27% of the interviewees regard this as a possibility, as might be the case if the switch to autonomous vehicles does not disadvantage 30% of drivers. The VWFS official said it should let the public know the safety protocols and the benefits of self-driving vehicles. Public Funding of AI-Driven Technology The Automated Vehicles Bill is set to receive Royal Assent later this year. Until 2030, investors are expected to invest £150 million in autonomous vehicles. This project aspires to turn the UK into one of the most advanced developers in the field, looking beyond the tepid public opinion. While the motoring trade organization hails technology as how too many people could be saved from death on the roads, it could also stimulate economic growth and development. The survey shows that we need to educate society about the impact of reliability and service on the end user. With self-driving vehicles, the possibility of decreasing the number of accidents and saving lives arises. Nonetheless, a representative from the automotive industry trade body emphasized the importance of addressing public concerns and giving priority to the potential benefits.

Ethereum Price Surges 5% As Coinbase Upbeat On ETH ETF Approval Odds And This Might Be The Next Crypto To Explode","author":"thebittimes@thebitfinance.com (TheBitTimes.Com)","article_detailed_content":"The Ethereum price rose 5% in the last 24 hours to trade at $3,110 as of 10:16 p.m. EST on trading volume that skyrocketed 25% to $13.6 billion. This development follows comments from Coinbase analyst David Han, who suggested that the market might be underestimating the likelihood that a spot Ethereum ETF (exchange-traded fund) is approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) It has set deadlines of May 23 and 24 to decide whether to approve the applications for spot Ethereum ETFs submitted by VanEck and ArkInvest/21 Shares, respectively. \u201cThe market may be underestimating the timing and odds of a potential approval, which leaves room for surprises to the upside,\u201d Han said in a May 15 note. \u201dThere is room for surprise to the upside on this decision.\u201d While markets have all but ruled out the possibility of ETH ETF approvals this month, Han said the issue is only a matter of \u201dwhen, not if.\u201d A US Department of Justice indictment on May 15 that accused two individuals of wire fraud and money laundering by manipulating the Ethereum blockchain also is positive news for the prospects of ETH ETF approvals. The indictment emphasized the importance of network integrity, stating that Ethereum operates without a central authority or trusted intermediary, reaffirming the decentralized principles of the blockchain and making it less likely that the SEC can classify ETH as a security that is under its jurisdiction. The Emperor has no clothes. The SEC is believed to be taking the position that ETH is a security. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors at SDNY, who are representing the \u201cUnited States,\u201d have just alleged that Ethereum is \u201ca decentralized blockchain\u201d with \u201cNo central actor\u201d who \u201cruns\u2026 https://t.co/isIP4sV43I pic.twitter.com/pe8BdfBtut \u2014 orlando.btc (@Orlando_btc) May 16, 2024 Ethereum Price Set To Soar Over The Falling Wedge Pattern ETHUSD Chart Analysis Source: GeckoTerminal.com The Ethereum price has been on an upward trend this year, rising to a yearly high of $4,116 in March, data from GeckoTerminal shows. However, ETH took a downturn thereafter, trading down within a falling wedge pattern. ETH has found support around $2,850, which the bulls are using to push the price above to trade within the upper boundary of the wedge. The ETH price is trading above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a confirmation of the bullish rally to the upside. If the bullish momentum sustains, ETH could soar, overcoming the 50-day SMA at 3,175, a signal of an upward breakout. The reading on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that buyers have an upper hand. The RSI is rebounding from the oversold levels to over the 50-midline level, currently at 52 as it heads up. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also bullish. The MACD line (blue) crosses above the signal line (orange), forming a bullish crossover. The green bars on the histogram also extend above the neutral line. This shows that ETH is currently building up toward a positive momentum to the upside. Ethereum Price Prediction Long-term Analysis indicates that Ethereum (ETH) is bullish, with the goal of breaking above the falling wedge pattern. If the bulls propel the price to the upside, ETH would overcome the $3,175 resistance, which coincides with the 50-day SMA. Here, the bull will target $4,000 in the long term. However, if the bears take charge of the price at this level, ETH could undergo a price retrace back to the $2,735 support zone, which coincides with the 200-day SMA. As the ETH price gears up for another rally, investors are piling into the Mega Dice presale, which is the first GambleFi project on Solana. The presale\u2019s success is a key reason why 99Bitcoins, a prominent crypto YouTube channel with over 700,000 subscribers, believes that $DICE has the potential to soar 100X after its launch.

The exchange aims to align with the regulations governing cryptoasset markets, set to take effect this year. Since last year, the European Banking Authority (EBA) has urged stablecoin issuers to follow \u201cguiding principles\u201d to operate in Europe. However, the EBA has yet to finalize these guidelines, which include restrictions on stablecoins offered by issuers such as Tether. Kraken Considers Removing USDT Support in the EU Kraken highlighted that it is analyzing all potential scenarios in Europe, including the possibility of delisting USDT if it becomes unsustainable. The exchange continuously reviews the regulatory positions of European Union authorities. \u201cWhat we\u2019re clear about is that the scope of the type and number of stablecoins that are offered today in Europe are unlikely to be able to be offered going forward. At some point, there\u2019ll be a cut off at which that won\u2019t be possible. A lot of that will depend on which assets are being registered within the European Union under the e-money regime,\u201d said Marcus Hughes, Kraken\u2019s global head of regulatory strategy. Kraken is one of many exchanges expressing concern about the legal status of stablecoins in Europe. In March, OKX, another major exchange, suspended support for USDT, citing regulatory uncertainties. This move, initially preventive, now appears to be part of a broader trend in the EU.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino expressed concerns about MiCA\u2019s requirements, emphasizing the need for stablecoins to maintain 100% reserves in treasury bills to avoid bank failures. \u201cStablecoins should be able to keep 100% of reserves in treasury bills, rather than exposing themselves to bank failures keeping big chunk of reserves in uninsured cash deposits. We hope to continue the dialogue with EU regulators to address those concerns,\u201d Ardoino commented.

Our Jito price prediction expects JTO price to record a maximum level of $5.53 in 2024. In 2030, we expect JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain, which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we\u2019ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token. Overview Cryptocurrency Jito Token JTO Price $4.7 Market Cap $500,964,185 Trading Volume $221,358,332 Circulating Supply 1,000,000,000 JTO All-time High $5.28 All-time Low $1.43 Jito Technical Analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $13.71 (227.71%) Volatility 10.92% 50-Day SMA $3.43 14-Day RSI 59.42 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 66 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) JTO Price Analysis Jito price faces bullish pressure as it aims for $5 JTO price analysis shows a bullish pattern as the price aims for a surge above $5 Resistance for JITO is present at $5.3 Support for JTO/USD is present at $4.2 The JTO price analysis for 18 May confirms that Jito witnessed a bullish pressure as it faced increased buying activity. The price aims to break above $5; however, it is struggling to gain buying demand. JITO price analysis 1-day chart: Bulls struggle in meeting buying goals Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO\u2019s price witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above $5. Over the last 24 hours, JITO price has been on a bearish path as sellers continue to show confidence around the $5 level. The 24-hour volume surged to $61.4 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. JITO price is currently trading at $4.7, increasing by over 3.2% in the last 24 hours. The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and currently hovers around 68-level, showing that bulls are slowly gaining the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests upward volatility in the next few hours. JITO/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a decline below EMA20 trend line The 4-hour JITO price chart suggests JTO continues to experience bullish activity near EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to surge above EMA lines, bears are aiming for a decline below the EMA20 trend line. The BoP indicator is trading in a bullish region at 0.03, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost an upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions. Jito Price Predictions: Levels And Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.62 BUY SMA 5 $3.67 BUY SMA 10 $3.45 BUY SMA 21 $3.38 BUY SMA 50 $3.43 BUY SMA 100 $2.91 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $3.69 BUY EMA 5 $3.61 BUY EMA 10 $3.49 BUY EMA 21 $3.42 BUY EMA 50 $3.30 BUY EMA 100 $3.05 BUY What to expect from JITO price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $5.3, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $5.7. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $4.2, resulting in a correction to $3.3. Is Jito A Good Investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to participate in governing one of the network\u2019s largest liquid staking protocols\u2014undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will have a keen interest in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito\u2019s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there\u2019s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, the unveiling of a future roadmap or the declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Recent JTO News/Opinions Jito, a liquid staking and MEV infrastructure project, now leads as the top protocol on Solana with $1.4 billion in total value locked. This equals about 10 million SOL, or roughly 38% of the Solana ecosystem\u2019s $3.7 billion TVL, per DeFiLlama. Marinade is second with $1.37 billion, followed by Kamino ($1 billion), Raydium ($613 million), and Marginfi ($424 million). Jito Price Prediction May 2024 Over the last few weeks, JTO coin price has been on an uptrend and it aims to record further gains by breaking above the $4.5 mark. However, sellers might strongly defend a surge in the coming hours due to overbought RSI level. According to technical analysis, we might see JTO price to record the maximum level of $5.3 and minimum price of $2.8, with an average value of $3.5 throughout May. Jito Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Jito Price Prediction May 2024 $2.8 $3.5 $5.3 Jito Price Prediction 2024 The effects of Bitcoin Halving typically appear 12-18 months afterward, but 2024 might see a different trend due to heightened institutional interest and improved macroeconomic factors. During the JTO airdrop, the token was available on major exchanges except Kraken, leaving one significant listing announcement to excite traders. However, this impact is likely minor. A critical factor influencing the 2024 Jito price forecast is progress on the Jito protocol. While there isn\u2019t a clear roadmap, the announcement of future developments could boost interest in the token. Based on technical analysis and forecast data, the projected minimum price of Jito in 2024 is $4.86. The price could potentially climb to a maximum of $5.53, with an expected average around $5.05.

What do Analysts Have to Say?","author":"Pooja Khardia","article_detailed_content":"Dogecoin price has gained a little surge over the last few days and is currently valued at $0.1547. In the last 24 hours only, DOGE price is up by 3%, and many more might come, but a few analysts have spoken of the possibility of a price drop in the coming days. So what is happening? Let us look at what the analysts have to say about Dogecoin price. Why Dogecoin(DOGE) Price Is Rising Now? Dogecoin has hosted multiple development activities, contributing to the current price surge. The development activities referenced here are about the network improvement by the developers. These development activities were highest in February, when the metric went from 0.39 to 16.24, causing the DOGE price to jump from $0.08 to $0.14. Many similar activities have happened on Dogecoin, creating the same price jump. Moreover, based on the moving averages data, DOGE is in a strong buying zone, but the RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands are putting the crypto in a slight buying zone. Such buying action mixed with greedy market sentiments has pushed the price till now. Is Dogecoin Price Drop on The Verge of Fall Since April, Dogecoin price has been moving between $0.13 to $0.16 with no breakthrough. But now the price can drop even lower. It is because an anonymous whale has dumped $18.55 Million worth of DOGE on the Robinhood exchange, which can initiate the selling pressure for the meme coin. Also Read: Crypto Market Enters The Greed Zone: Start Of Bull Run? Also, with the ongoing development coming to an end, Dogecoin price may begin to decline. DOGE is already struggling to perform the way it did earlier, which is concerning for the analysts as the market instability is only making it worse. Moreover, the liquidity concerns are still there for meme king. Currently, the DOGE liquidation level is between $0.15 and $0.16, which is a little riskier. Also, the Cumulative Liquidation Level Delta (CLLD) indicated a price pullback of up to $0.12. Lastly, Dogecoin holders\u2019 position is also a risk factor as the 24-hour active addresses have reduced to 54,600 from 250,000 in February, and such factors do indicate the possibility of price falls. Final Thought After its rally in March, the dogecoin price is continuously declining, and many more declines might come due to whale dumping and liquidity issues. Analysts have spoken of the DOGE price to drop to $0.12, the lowest price in the last two months. It has to see how DOGE will move next in the market.

This alarming trend underscores the pressing need for heightened vigilance among cryptocurrency users. The majority of these thefts have been facilitated through fraudulent means, where users unintentionally grant permissions to malicious entities. These incidents highlight the critical importance of meticulously scrutinizing any approval requests related to yield tokens. Escalating Theft Incidents Highlight Security Vulnerabilities The most recent incident in this troubling series of thefts involved a victim who lost $5.62 million worth of Pendle yield tokens. This loss occurred when the user, identified by the address 0xe..f05, inadvertently signed a phishing signature disguised as a legitimate permit. This deceptive act enabled the scammer, identified by the address 0xa\u2026a6f, to gain unauthorized access to the victim\u2019s tokens. This particular case is part of a broader pattern of thefts that has intensified over the past week, with four significant phishing incidents each resulting in losses exceeding $1 million. These events have collectively led to a staggering total loss of $9.04 million. Most of these thefts involved Pendle yield tokens, and the predominant method of attack has been through fraudulent permit phishing signatures. This disturbing trend underscores the urgent need for robust security measures and increased user awareness within the cryptocurrency community to combat these sophisticated phishing schemes.

Subsequently, the crypto whale used 1,870 ETH to acquire the 6 million ONDO tokens. This transaction has caught the crypto community\u2019s attention. Coincidentally, ONDO, the native token of Ondo Finance, witnessed a notable price increase following the purchase. What Comes Next for ONDO\u2019s Price? On-chain data shows that this crypto whale bought ONDO at an average price of $0.95. This entry price is intriguing, as some analysts believe ONDO\u2019s fair price range is between $0.40 and $0.70. Given their significant investment above the anticipated range, Lookonchain suspects the whale might have insider knowledge. Following the whale\u2019s purchase, ONDO\u2019s price surged. It surpassed the $1 mark and briefly hit $1.04. This surge brings ONDO closer to its all-time high of $1.05, recorded on March 31. However, ONDO is trading at $1.03 at the time of writing. The figure marks a 9.9% increase over the last 24 hours and a 26.3% rise in the past week. Read more: What Are Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA)? ONDO Price Performance. Source: BeInCrypto Crypto analyst Mags commented on the price movement. He shared his analysis for ONDO\u2019s next price target. \u201cIf the price closes above $1, the next target would be $1.40 and $2.70+,\u201d Mags wrote. Despite this recent transaction, Ondo Finance, known for its innovative approach to tokenized securities, has recently been in the spotlight. Earlier this month, the platform announced a strategic partnership with Zebec Network. This collaboration aims to enhance USDY, a stablecoin\u2019s operation. Furthermore, it will integrate Zebec\u2019s Instant Card technology and real-world asset (RWA) payment solutions. In another significant development, in March, Ondo Finance transferred $95 million to BlackRock\u2019s newly launched tokenized fund, BUIDL. It aims to facilitate instant settlements for the Ondo Short-Term US Government Fund (OUSG), backed by US Treasuries. This move is particularly noteworthy since it is the first time a crypto protocol has used a tokenized fund for its offerings. Read more: What is The Impact of Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization?

This aligns with recent research from CoinGecko, which predicts that RWA will be a dominant crypto narrative in 2024. Based on its data, as of May 18, crypto assets in the RWA category have a cumulative market capitalization of $8.43 billion.
