However, an assessment of the Layer 2 (L2) token\u2019s performance on a three-day chart hinted at the possibility of a further decline in its value in the short term. Arbitrum Traders Wonder If the Time Is Right At press time, ARB\u2019s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, assessed using different moving averages (30-day and 365-day), returned negative values. The token\u2019s MVRV ratios on 30-day and 365-day moving averages were -3.51% and -31.72%, respectively. An asset\u2019s MVRV ratio tracks the ratio between the asset\u2019s current market price and the average price of its coin or token circulation. When its value is positive, the asset is overvalued. This means that the asset\u2019s current value is higher than the price at which most investors acquire their holdings. On the other hand, a negative MVRV ratio suggests that the asset in question is undervalued, as its market value is below the average purchase price of all its tokens in circulation. A negative MVRV ratio presents a good time to buy because it signals to traders that the asset trades at a price lower than its historical cost basis. Hence, if they buy at that point, they will see returns. Arbitrum MVRV Ratio Source: Santiment Further, a negative sentiment has been trailing ARB since April. At press time, the token\u2019s weighted sentiment was -0.99.

When an asset\u2019s sentiment grows poor, and the market expects further decline, crypto assets often initiate uptrends as sellers become increasingly exhausted. ARB Price Prediction: Short-term Losses Are Ahead While the metrics highlighted above hinted at the possibility of a rally, some indicators showed that the market may witness a further downtrend in the short term. At the time of writing, ARB\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 29.79, sitting below the neutral line. This signaled that traders preferred to sell their ARB rather than hold them or accumulate more tokens. The RSI measures the momentum of an asset\u2019s price change. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 suggesting overbought conditions and below 30 signaling oversold conditions. Further, ARB\u2019s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures the flow of capital into and out of the asset, was -0.10 at press time. This negative value suggested increased liquidity exit from the token\u2019s market, which may put downward pressure on its price. If bearish pressure mounts, ARB\u2019s price may fall below the long-term support of $0.92 at which it currently trades. Its value may drop under $0.90 to trade at $0.84.

At the same time, while Borroe Finance ($ROE), which is a disruptive and highly innovative DeFi platform, is gaining more and more traction in the community. >>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<< Internet Computer's ckUSDC: A New Approach to Stablecoins The Internet Computer (ICP) from DFINITY Foundation is a blockchain which has the purpose of changing the Internet by providing a decentralized and scalable platform for smart contracts and applications. The most recent stablecoin is an intermediary token to enable interaction and exchange between decentralized applications and traditional financial systems, hence, providing uninterrupted connectivity and interaction. cryptOMC is the cryptographic protocol that is designed to let canisters (Internet Computers and smart contracts) interact with the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin. The chain-key signatures are the way of interaction that allow canisters to create their own Bitcoin addresses and to launch a valid transaction. The chain key tokens such as the chain-key-bitcoin (ckBTC) is an important element as it provides a simple and fast channel of assets between many different blockchains. The ckUSDC works with the protocol level economics and governance mechanism of Internet Computer.

Developed on the ZK Stack utilizing zkSync technology on Ethereum, the Lens Network is poised to address and overcome the prevalent scalability challenges faced by blockchain technologies. It aims to match conventional social networks\u2019 user experience while retaining web3\u2019s distinctive features, such as user ownership and secure transactions. Per the announcement, the primary goal of the Lens Network is to enable the broad adoption of web3 social functionalities by providing a robust infrastructure that can support new user experiences and monetization models. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Avara, emphasized that the Lens Network would introduce a hybrid architecture combining Validium and Volition with the ZK Stack on Ethereum, thereby scaling effectively and contributing to a more open and fair internet. Alex Gluchowski, co-founder and CEO of Matter Labs, highlighted the crucial balance that the Lens Network aims to maintain between user-friendly interfaces and essential elements like data ownership, freedom of speech, and transaction security. The new network promises to empower developers with the flexibility to build diverse social applications and support seamless integration with EVM and non-EVM blockchains. The rollout of the Lens Network will occur in three phases, starting with a Validium that uses ZK compression techniques on Ethereum to ensure robust data accessibility. Subsequent phases will introduce separate Validium chains designed to cater to different social network use cases and levels of privacy, eventually culminating in a Volition network that blends rollups and Validium for enhanced security and flexibility. Lens Labs also highlighted enhanced user empowerment, with features allowing users more control over their online presence and interaction modalities. The network supports existing Lens Profiles and offers new minting options on the Lens website, ensuring users can effortlessly maintain or expand their digital identities. Christina Beltramini, a long-standing member of the Lens team, expressed her enthusiasm about the launch of the Lens Network. Reflecting on her journey, she stated, \u201cJoining the Lens team over 2.5 years ago, we set out to radically transform social media. Our goal was to advance the possibilities of social, but not by compromising on the fundamentals of the blockchain and its potential. This has always been core to our vision.\u201d Beltramini emphasized that the development of the Lens Network marks a significant milestone in realizing its vision of a scalable, secure, and cost-effective blockchain-based social media solution that does not sacrifice user experience.

This unprecedented ruling can create a dangerous precedent for cryptocurrency and privacy development, challenging previous worldwide regulatory knowledge. In a surprising development, Alexey Pertsev was convicted of money laundering\u2014not because he directly laundered money, but because he developed and maintained an open-source and permissionless privacy tool on Ethereum (ETH) that a minority of users allegedly used for criminal activities. Notably, the Dutch court estimates that 84% of all transactions in Tornado Cash were non-criminal, according to a report by FreedomTech. This has outraged the crypto and privacy communities, as experts warn of a dangerous precedent that could harm the industry.

Experts warn of dangerous precedent from Tornado Cash\u2019s Dutch ruling In this context, independent journalist and privacy advocate Lola Leetz deemed the Tornado Cash verdict \u201ccompletely insane.\u201d In a thread posted on X, Leetz explained the consequences of the Dutch ruling and how it changes developers\u2019 accountability. As described, \u201copen-source developers building non-custodial tools can be held responsible for criminal activity when criminal actors cannot be stopped or deanonymized.\u201d Leetz also explained that this laid out software development as criminal intent. Moreover, the journalist classifies Tornado Cash as a communications service despite the court ruling otherwise. The entire Tornado Cash verdict is completely insane and will turn the legality of building any privacy service on its head. 1.Open-source devs building non-custodial tools can be held responsible for criminal activity when crim. actors cannot be stopped or deanonymized pic.twitter.com/Bjw9ry5zkM \u2014 L0la L33tz (@L0laL33tz) May 14, 2024 The open-source development and privacy hub FreedomTech made a similar thread that delves into more details of the Tornado Cash ruling on the Netherlands. Essentially, the thread argues that Pertsev could not stop the illicit use of his tool and highlights that it even implemented compliance features according to the known regulations at that time.

Interestingly, Joel Valenzuela \u2013 responsible for business development and marketing for Dashpay \u2013 warned of privacy being \u201cunder attack.\u201d Valenzuela mentioned other regulation and enforcement events that fall in a similar category to Alexey Pertsev\u2019s sentencing. In particular, the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers, Wasabi Wallet\u2019s leaving the United States and then shutting down, privacy coins\u2019 delistings, and peer-to-peer crypto exchange platforms\u2019 shutting down. Nevertheless, the content creator highlighted privacy as a human right and a normal attribute to seek. According to him, cryptocurrency users should focus on using privacy by default for everyday transactions, like \u201cbuying a coffee.\u201d Joel also said developers should avoid being in the U.S. and Europe while remaining anonymous for safety concerns.

This decision undermines the role of developers in creating open-source, non-custodial tools. Experts warn that targeting developers in this way threatens innovation and privacy rights. The case has agitated the crypto community, emphasizing potential widespread implications for similar technologies. Developers and privacy advocates continue to voice their concerns, pointing out the ruling\u2019s broader impact on privacy and online freedom. Moving forward, the industry must navigate these new legal challenges carefully to protect privacy and foster innovation in the digital space.

The on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain highlighted this remarkable profit, amounting to a 15,718x return. Indeed, the trader\u2019s success story showcases the volatility and potential of meme coins. Yet, it raises questions about the timing and knowledge behind such trades. PEPE Trader\u2019s Remarkable Profit Stirs Market Speculations Lookonchain outlined that the trader initially invested nearly $3,000 on April 15, 2023, to purchase 4.9 trillion PEPE tokens. Since then, PEPE\u2019s value has skyrocketed. This allowed the trader to sell portions of their holdings for substantial profits. They sold 1.41 trillion PEPE for $7.4 million and 255 billion PEPE for approximately $2.3 million. Despite these sales, the trader still holds 3.5 trillion PEPE, valued at around $38.9 million based on current prices. \u201c[Their] total profit on PEPE is ~$46.3 million,\u201d Lookonchain concluded. Read more: 7 Hot Meme Coins and Altcoins that are Trending in 2024 The Trader\u2019s Transactions to Purchase 4.9 Trillion PEPE. Source: X/Lookonchain However, the purchase date raised questions among the crypto community since it was close to PEPE\u2019s launch time. Moreover, on the same date, on-chain data revealed that the trader swapped 20,000 Timeless (LIT) tokens, worth roughly $2,256, to buy 3.4 trillion PEPE. Given LIT\u2019s relatively obscure status and market capitalization of only $3.6 million, the decision to trade LIT for PEPE at that moment suggests a level of insider knowledge. On April 15, 2023, the LIT token traded at $0.111814, starkly contrasting its current price of $0.001539. This further fueled speculation about the trader\u2019s possible insider status. Nevertheless, the trade proved timely and extraordinarily profitable. Read more: Pepe (PEPE) Price Prediction 2024 / 2025 / 2030 LIT Price Performance. Source: CoinGecko Regardless of the trader\u2019s insider status, PEPE has experienced a meteoric rise. CoinGecko data indicates that PEPE reached a new all-time high of $0.00001151 today, marking its second record high this week. With a market capitalization of $4.68 billion, PEPE now ranks third among meme coins, trailing only Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). PEPE\u2019s recent success can be attributed to the renewed interest in meme assets following the return of Keith Gill, also known as \u201cThe Roaring Kitty.\u201d Gill, famed for his role in the GameStop stock frenzy, recently resurfaced on social media, igniting a wave of speculation and investment in meme coins and stocks. BeInCrypto reported that Gill\u2019s comeback has driven significant gains in meme coins like Roaring Kitty (KITTY) and GameStop (GME), with GME\u2019s price surging by 3,814% in the past week alone.

Finance Magnates spoke with James Glyde, CEO of PipFarm for his perspective and preferences on prop trading platforms. He also touched on the overall prop trading market and the strengths and weaknesses of multiple offerings. What motivated you to launch PipFarm when there is so much competition in the funded trader sector? Honestly, it\u2019s exciting. Having worked in regulated business environments my entire career, I saw a great opportunity to use my skills and background to build an exciting product and brand without having both hands tied behind my back. We\u2019re planning a lot of fun stuff product-wise. It\u2019s true, the level of competition increased significantly recently. We have already noticed the impact: PPC bidding costs have risen, affiliates are becoming more selective and demanding, and competition is pushing prices down and risk up. However, this level of competition is temporary. Inevitably, many newcomers will fade away when they encounter operational problems, do not gain the expected traction, or do not meet their forecast profit margin. It\u2019s already happening big names too. How has the prop trading industry responded to the MetaQuotes prohibition? When MetaQuotes informed brokers to immediately cease grey labelling their MetaTrader platforms to evaluation firms, most reacted by suspending their operations. Some firms haven\u2019t recovered. Many evaluation firms built a business model that infringed on the terms and conditions of their primary platform provider. Another reason I chose cTrader is that Spotware has tailored its agreements for the funded trader business model. They officially support this business model. While many traders suffered from firms pausing operations, it provided cTrader a great opportunity to become the preferred trading platform among aspiring prop traders. One thing I\u2019ve observed in all my roles is that cTrader users are more profitable traders. The prop trading industry triggered a resurgence of white-label trading platforms. Can you explain why you chose cTrader? The planning of PipFarm began long before the launch. Last year, every funded trader firm offered MT4 or MT5. At the time, only FTMO offered cTrader. There was a clear opportunity for the first one-stage cTrader prop firm evaluation. cTrader was an easy choice for me. The platform is feature-rich, well-developed, thoroughly tested, incredibly stable and extensively documented. Having spent several years selling and later working with cTrader at various brokers, I know this platform will meet PipFarm\u2019s demands. You played a key role in the company\u2019s early development and even accepted cTrader\u2019s first Best Trading Platform award at the 2018 Finance Magnates London Summit. What are your thoughts on how the company has matured since leaving? cTrader was ahead of its time, and brokers were set in their ways. However, as time passed, cTrader\u2019s novel features became more conventional; now, the platform offers the most comprehensive trading experience, with manual, automated, and copy trading all rolled into one. The substantial investment in mobile trading has really paid off, too. Now, cTrader wins awards yearly, and brokers are expected to offer cTrader. That only happened because of 15 years of consistently developing new features while competitors let their products stagnate. Most prop firms leading the industry are managed by individuals and teams outside the online trading industry. This year, experienced professionals like yourself are entering the market; why now and what impact will that have on the market? People and companies who\u2019ve worked in the industry as long as I have are naturally cautious. We\u2019re used to following rules and regulations and considering the potential risk and impact of every decision. As I mentioned earlier, PipFarm resulted from months of consideration and planning. I\u2019m sure my peers watched the industry grow from the sidelines and consulted with regulatory experts before making their move. I feel there is a significant opportunity to level up the experience offered to traders. Most firms focus on churning accounts with aggressive promotions and unreasonable rules rather than focusing on what matters. We surveyed our small but growing community, and when asked which three features they look for in a prop firm, 85% said they look for firms with clear rules, and 75% avoid firms with consistency rules. 60% of respondents said they are happy with cTrader, and 19% said they don\u2019t care about the trading platform and rules are more important than platforms. While a handful of firms stand out and truly impress me, many more simply practice aggressive and dishonest marketing tactics. Why do you think this market is rife with inexperience? We\u2019ve seen this before with forex brokers in 2011, binary options in 2015, ICOs in 2017 and now this. It\u2019s a product where, according to the marketing campaigns, with a small investment, you could make lots more money. In the end, things got so out of hand that regulators had to step in and take away every advantage. Just as consumers are attracted to the potential to profit, so are operators, who can set up highly profitable businesses with minimal barriers to entry and no oversight or operational expenses related to legal or compliance. Everything can be thrown into the marketing budget. Funded trader evaluations are a fantastic product that allows everyone to access and try trading with minimal financial liability. I hope more experienced participants will protect this industry and preserve its advantages for users before it\u2019s too late.

The event took place at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. Google\u2019s Gemini AI demo revealed various capabilities of the Gemini AI. These demonstrations confirmed the huge possibilities of AI in different areas and gave the viewers a firsthand experience of the technology\u2019s huge potential. Email Interactions and Information Retrieval with Gemini AI. Among all the improvements presented at Google I/O, the most amazing was the Summarize Emails feature for Gmail, which Gemini AI powers. This feature tackles the problem of information overload by shortening long emails into summaries that the user likes. With the help of natural language processing abilities, Gemini can extract the required information from large email communications. Hence, users can review the key points without wasting time on large content. Gmail Q&A: The process of Email Interaction Should Be Much Simpler. Paradoxically, many Time-Wasting Activities exist. Assume that would be boiled down to five. TFL: This is deleting address duplicates and replying to conflicts. One of the significant incidents that came to light was the Gmail Q&A feature, a tool created to simplify email communications in the Google Workspace. Thus, this feature enables users to ask Gemini a particular question; the AI will then get the data of the emails right away. Gemini AI\u2019s advanced capabilities Gemini\u2019s ability to recognize and sort different content types, such as receipts and invoices, can be seen. This capability is a new way of doing tasks that involves producing new things by managing the company\u2019s resources creatively; therefore, it makes the business more productive by automating the tiresome and boring tasks of the company, and it also helps in information recovery to be done quickly and efficiently. Gemini Advanced proved its competence in dealing with complex data sets, showing its ability to do a 1,500-page PDF document accurately. This demo proved the Gemini\u2019s ability to get information from long texts, which helped it understand the context and, therefore, could quickly extract information from the texts. Besides, Gemini\u2019s ability to find the differences and similarities in the documents shows its potential for many uses, such as regulations compliance and academic research. AI coaching with Gemini AI coaching for soccer, in which Gemini displayed the players\u2019 actual performance on the spot. Using computer vision technology, Gemini tested players\u2019 techniques and gave them the feedback necessary to raise their skills. This example of the use of AI in sports training manifests its transformation of skill development; thus, it provides personalized insights specific to individual players\u2019 needs. Project Astra\u2019s AR revolution The innovative Project Astra brought to the scene the latest AR technology and techniques using Gemini AI, which changed the way people communicate with digital content. Through the use of real-time object recognition and multi-modal reasoning, Project Astra makes the user interact more effectively in different areas, from gaming to everyday tasks. The ability of the device to maintain the context is a sign of great progress in the field of AR technology, which thus will make the experiences immersive and personalized. Imagen 3 redefines visual creation Artificial Intelligence is pushing the Boundaries of Generative AI to the point where it is no longer possible to distinguish it from a human. In image 3, the generation of AI and the capabilities of AI in image creation are shown; hence, the user can create visually stunning content using textual prompts. This new invention is the inventor of new creative worlds, allowing users to create different visual products with little input. Through AI, Imagen 3 enables users to create their ideas and journey into new areas of expression. MusicFX DJ music composition with AI The key factor that differentiates the future of music creation from the current will be the incorporation of AI in the music production process and the enhancement of the creative aspect of music through AI-powered tools. Through the MusicFX DJ, the interaction of AI and music composition was displayed. The users were provided with a unique platform to compose music using intuitive controls and text prompts. This cutting-edge device boosts creativity by allowing users to play with different sound combinations and arrangements. Although MusicFX DJ accepts traditional music composition styles, it is also an encouraging way to promote music education and artistic expression.","article_summary":"Google I/O 2024, an annual developer conference, demonstrated several spectacular innovations in AI via the Gemini model.

Runes are still in the discovery stage, but recent OKX statistics show mainstream trading may soon take off. 🚨Runes are thriving on our Marketplace🚨 In the first few weeks since launch we've had: #️\u20e3 +1K BTC trading volume #️\u20e3 +100K no. of transactions #️\u20e3 +57K cumulative no. of pending orders Etch, manage & trade #Runes with full self-custody using #OKXWallet now. pic.twitter.com/0lDIVfNLrG \u2014 OKX (@okx) May 13, 2024 OKX is also turning into an informal hub for early Runes trading. More than 50% of current volumes are concentrated on the exchange, where price discovery is happening. The appearance of runes followed a few months of testing out BRC-20 tokens as the main tool on the Bitcoin network. Runes are specific assets based on direct UTXO records, which first went live in April 2024. The early-stage asset may greatly impact the ecosystem, while avoiding blockchain bloat. Runes Aim for Efficient Bitcoin-Based Tokenization The potential to create runes has existed since Bitcoin block 840,000, or for fewer than 4,000 blocks. Runes are the brainchild of Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmore, to boost the creation of fungible tokens with a minimal effect on the blockchain. Overall, Runes are trying to offer a better tokenization standard, following previous attempts to generate Bitcoin-based tokens. Previously, Bitcoin offered technologies like colored coins. Later, Taproot assets, RGB tokens and BRC-20 assets went through their own hype cycle, but started causing network overload and high transaction fees. If Runes fulfills its promises, it may become the tool for the long-awaited \u201cBitcoin summer of DeFi\u201d. The only drawback is that the expansion of Runes may take some time, and projects may already be dedicated to an older type of token. Runes Boost New Wave of Meme Tokens In the early days of Runes application, the chief driver for new projects is the creation or expansion of memes. The current leader of Rune technology tokens is Dog-Go-To-The-Moon (DOG), which is relatively obscure compared to other meme assets. DOG is ranked 268 based on market capitalization, with a supply of 100B tokens. The new meme token Rune launched on April 27, at $0.004, then slid by 50% to the current range of $0.002. Overall, Runes-based tokens have a market cap of just under $200M in total, but even at this early stage are showing competition and hype. Who Will Bring Liquidity to Runes? Runes offer some novelty, but token generation has become almost trivial in crypto space. In fact, more than 1 million tokens have been created, and very few make it into a liquid asset with meaningful trading. Finding the users, investors and markets for those tokens is a whole other issue. Just as soon as Runes launched on Bitcoin, there are projects that aim to bridge them with the Ethereum ecosystem, which still has the most liquid decentralized financial services. 🫂 #RunesBridge and @TunaChain forge a strategic alliance, Aiming to cultivate a vibrant and robust Bitcoin ecosystem for all users. 🔗 Tuna Chain, a modular Layer 2 solution built on #Bitcoin, introduces a native stablecoin and a Hybrid ZK-OP solution. It effortlessly\u2026 pic.twitter.com/T45SkUcVLy \u2014 RunesBridge (@RunesBridge) May 14, 2024 Currently, Runes projects are trying to build liquidity models, including Ordinals, NFT, and fungible tokens. Collections are dropping almost daily, competing for attention. Runes fungible tokens are still extremely volatile, even the earliest tokens with the most recognizable brands. Gentlemen, it's been a privilege playing with you #Runes pic.twitter.com/0JNzFhqswO \u2014 RomanSoldier (@RomanSoldierNFT) May 14, 2024 At the current early stage, Runes are all about hype and seeing which memes and collections will rise. Early investors are trying to buy up as much Runes as possible. The Runes and NFT trading systems are still trying to smooth out order books to avoid volatility. Runes hopes to create an environment similar to Ethereum-based DeFi.

The main hope is that the Bitcoin DeFi summer may build value similar to that locked on Solana and Ethereum. Runes may also be used for airdrops, or tied to Ordinals collections. Since anyone can \u201cetch\u201d a Rune and airdrop it, wallets are already receiving copycat tokens and new assets, with no known history or liquidity. Additionally, valid Runes in 2024 are those minted after block 840,000. Earlier projects also claimed to mint Runes, but some of the early assets may be destroyed or invalid.","article_summary":"The market for Runes, the new generation of Bitcoin-based tokens, is taking off and showing both growing volumes and some clear winners.

The Bitget Onchain Layer will not only integrate a host of native DApps within Bitget Wallet through joint collaboration with builders, but also position Bitget Wallet as the primary on-chain extension and future of the Bitget ecosystem. Concurrently, a $10 million BWB Ecosystem Fund has also been established, dedicated to accelerating the development of the Bitget Onchain Layer and supporting aligned projects and initiatives. Powering the Bitget Onchain Layer are native Modular Feature-DApps (MFDs), specialized applications to streamline user interactions, enhance liquidity aggregation, and fortify security measures. Initially, the ecosystem fund will be dedicated towards the investment and incubation of various Web3 trading services, of which three are already in the pipeline: Pre-Market, on-chain derivatives market, and Trading Bot. These services, in the form of MFDs, will further complement Bitget Wallet\u2019s existing Swap trading service. Since its inception as a multi-chain wallet in 2018, Bitget Wallet has evolved into a comprehensive platform featuring native functions such as multi-chain wallet, Swap, intelligent market data, Launchpad, inscriptions tool, and earning center, reflecting its transformation from an asset management tool to a full-stack DeFi ecosystem and platform. In this journey, Bitget Wallet has attracted over 20 million users globally and has gained widespread recognition. Just last month, the platform achieved a record high in Swap data, with trading and order volumes surpassing MetaMask. As Bitget Wallet continues to build, several enduring yet unresolved challenges in the Web3 space demand attention, including navigating across multiple blockchain networks, selecting the right DEXs, choosing from a myriad of liquidity pools, and much more, oftentimes resulting in a poor user experience. To produce innovative solutions to these problems, Bitget Wallet first began by introducing a native swap aggregator, Bitget Swap, to cater towards user demands for seamless on-chain trading and potential earning experiences. Deploying Bitget Swap as a native platform feature also opened up avenues for more value-added features including gas-free transactions and multiple trading modes to enhance the overall trading experience for users, forming the first step in Bitget Wallet\u2019s journey to developing a native on-chain ecosystem layer. On a macro level, the Bitget Onchain Layer serves as an intermediate layer that abstracts away complexities for users to interact with the Web3 world with the help of Modular-Feature DApps (MFDs). These function both as standalone DApps as well as native features integrated directly into Bitget Wallet. By working with industry developers to create effective and purposeful MFDs, Bitget Wallet aims to meet users\u2019 needs in a more efficient manner, while also supporting developers and DApp projects in Web3. Aside from trading, the Bitget Onchain Layer also aims to provide native accessibility for new narratives, assets, and opportunities across Web3 from Bitget Wallet by introducing an open and collaborative ecosystem strategy to offer comprehensive coverage over a spectrum of financial services. In tandem with the development of the Bitget Onchain Layer, the wallet has also prioritized the burgeoning Meme ecosystem as a central focus of its product roadmap. Following the launch of Bitget Wallet\u2019s experimental Meme token, $MOEW, the platform plans to explore further integrations and community engagements within this space, including Meme Grants and events to bolster Meme culture and Web3 engagement. Bitget Wallet has also engineered a dedicated Meme token leaderboard within its wallet interface, providing users with up-to-date information on the latest trending Meme coins and price movements, providing the competitive edge needed to stay ahead of the Meme market. Bitget Wallet and the Bitget Onchain Layer are fundamentally anchored by the BWB token, which has multiple roles within the ecosystem, including governance voting, eligibility for participation in Launchpad events, staking rewards, and payment of multichain gas fees, among other utilities. Following the conclusion of the BWB Points Airdrop Campaign and BWB Ecosystem Partner Program, the wallet has now announced its allocation plans for the BWB token. The total supply of BWB tokens is set at 1 billion, distributed across community rewards, team, and partnership initiatives. Nearly 47% of this total supply will be allocated to the community treasury and 10% will go to investors, while 5% will be reserved for the pre-TGE (token generation event) airdrop. Moving ahead, Bitget Wallet will continue to refine its platform by integrating high-frequency and core features that enhance user experience and interaction within the Web3 ecosystem. The focus will remain on product growth and strategic infrastructure development to sustain advancement and ensure a robust foundation for the future. Bitget Wallet\u2019s evolution reflects its commitment to pushing the boundaries of what a Web3 wallet can offer. It has transitioned from asset management to a broader scope of DeFi functionalities, reinforcing its market position and setting a new standard in the cryptocurrency and DeFi space. About Bitget Wallet Bitget Wallet is Asia\u2019s largest and leading global Web3 trading wallet, with over 20 million users worldwide. It offers a comprehensive range of features, including asset management, intelligent market data, swap trading, launchpad, inscribing, and DApp browsing. Currently, it supports more than 100 major blockchains, hundreds of EVM-compatible chains, and over 250,000 cryptocurrencies. Bitget Wallet enhances liquidity by aggregating it across hundreds of top DEXs and cross-chain bridges, facilitating seamless trading on nearly 50 blockchains.

However, the impact on education has been felt more instantly than anywhere else. The role of AI in student learning Students, rather than working themselves via conventional learning exercises, might ask a computer to write essays, solve arithmetic problems,or finish complicated coursework projects quickly and attribute the results to themselves. But the equation is changing as now institutes are looking at ways they can incorporate AI in the education system that can produce positive outcomes and enhance the learning experience rather than stifle it. There is an abundance of data that shows how students around the world are utilizing AI to complement their studies. In addition to that, students also want to learn AI. A study report by the GoStudent organization noted that 83% of students in the UK who have used AI really liked it. The indications in the data are quite clear; for innovators and educators alike, the paradigm should be towards \u2018how AI can enhance education\u2019 rather than \u2018how to stop students from using it.\u2019 Source: Gostudent. Merging AI and human elements in education Experts think that in education, the importance of human instructors can never be underestimated. Even though AI has the potential to make tasks simple and speed up the learning process, it cannot replace the human interactions that take place in the classroom. But AI can help teachers create tailored lesson plans in a matter of a few minutes and generate lesson transcripts and summaries so that they have more time to spend with students discussing the topics. There are about 220 million pupils that are out of school around the globe. But the ones who are at school are also not learning the essential skills that can help them transition successfully into a useful workforce. According to a World Economic Forum report, AI can help address these gaps in the education and social systems. The report also highlighted that, in addition to helping to develop students\u2019 digital literacy, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, AI can enhance how pupils are guided and assessed. While grading through AI remains an ethical concern, we think that the former can be achieved with the help of technology. The Forum\u2019s Future of Jobs report ranks the above-mentioned qualities as some of the most in-demand skill sets. Above all, AI offers a more customized method of instruction that is tailored to the requirements and interests of each individual learner.","article_summary":"Ever since ChatGPT appeared on the scene last year, there has been a great deal of conjecture over the long-term effects on many businesses and activities.
