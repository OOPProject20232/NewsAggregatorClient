BlockTower Loses AUM Another day, another crypto exploit. This time, the victim is the major crypto hedge fund, BlockTower Capital. Hackers have managed to break through the hedge fund\u2019s defenses and siphon away a significant percentage of its total assets under management (AUM), which is estimated to be at least $1.7 billion. Sources close to the matter have confirmed the breach, although specific details remain undisclosed. While the firm has refrained from issuing an official statement, key partners have been notified of the situation. The firm has brought in leading blockchain forensics analysts to trace the hacker and recover the stolen assets, demonstrating confidence in its recovery capabilities. Previous Troubles For BlockTower BlockTower Capital has faced previous setbacks, including a $1.5 million hack of decentralized exchange aggregator Dexible in February 2023, as well as challenges due to the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, both of which had significant crypto exposure. Furthermore, the closure of its \"market-neutral\" crypto fund, managing over $100 million, compounded the firm's challenges, reflecting a history of vulnerability to security threats. Sonne Finance Under Attack Too In a separate incident, Sonne Finance, a decentralized liquidity market protocol operating on Optimism and Base, experienced a cyber attack on May 15, resulting in a significant loss of funds. Initially reported by blockchain security firm Cyvers as a $3 million theft from Sonne's USD Coin (USDC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) contracts on the Optimism chain, the situation quickly escalated. Within 30 minutes, Cyvers updated the estimate to $20 million. Sonne Finance promptly addressed the incident on Twitter, announcing the pause of all markets on Optimism while assuring the safety of markets on Base. Shortly after, it was revealed that scammers attempted to further capitalize on the situation. A fraudulent Twitter account impersonating Sonne Finance urged users to revoke approvals to prevent further losses, accompanied by a suspicious link. However, the tweet was swiftly deleted. Security Exploits Plague Crypto Industry Cryptocurrency hacks continue to plague the industry, with significant losses reported over the years. In 2022, hackers stole $4 billion, followed by $2 billion in 2023. Despite a 65% reduction in hacking incidents as of April 2024, the monetary losses remain substantial. According to the SlowMist Weekly Security Report from April 28 to May 4, 2024, total losses from crypto-related security incidents amounted to $71.39 million.

Tron Whales Could Help Price Increase Tron\u2019s price has shown signs of being influenced by the impact of whale accumulation, and the same is happening now. The whale addresses holding TRX worth more than $100,000 and under $10 million have consistently added TRX to their wallets.

According to the Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator, about 1.14 billion TRX are awaiting profits. This supply was bought between $0.123 and $0.127 and is worth over $142 million.

Breaching this resistance would not only enable further rise but also turn the aforementioned supply profitable. This would, in effect, push the price upwards towards $0.130.

These individuals were involved in illegal businesses utilizing crypto, specifically Tether (USDT). The comprehensive crackdown revealed illicit transactions totaling approximately 13.8 billion yuan (~$1.9 billion). How Chinese Authorities Crack Down on Crypto Crimes The investigation started in November 2022 when authorities detected suspicious activities involving underground banks in Chengdu\u2019s Longquanyi District. Consequently, they formed a specialized task force, incorporating experts from various police departments. This also included economic investigation, cyber security, and legal affairs. This group provided unauthorized foreign exchange settlements, effectively bypassing national regulations. Read more: 9 Best Crypto Wallets to Store Tether (USDT) On June 1, 2023, following directives from the Ministry of Public Security, the task force executed coordinated raids across several major cities, including Shanghai and Shenzhen. These efforts led to the capture of key figures in the criminal syndicate, such as Lin, Weng, and Chen, along with 25 others. During these raids, law enforcement seized a plethora of bank cards and digital payment instruments linked to criminal activities. Further investigations uncovered that, since January 2021, the syndicate had exploited its import and export business to facilitate illegal activities. By using USDT as a medium, they circumvented official foreign exchange channels to service clients needing to transfer funds internationally. Moreover, these operations were intricately linked to other illicit activities, including financial fraud and smuggling. Zhong Yu, captain of the Eighth Brigade of the Economic Investigation Detachment at the Chengdu Municipal Public Security Bureau, highlighted the complexity of the network. \u201cThe suspect settled funds through underground banks and was suspected of engaging in illegal foreign exchange criminal activities,\u201d Yu said. Also, on May 13, BeInCrypto reported that the Chinese government arrested six people. They are allegedly responsible for illicit crypto transactions worth $295 million. These arrests underline the challenges and risks associated with crypto in unregulated environments. Read more: Crypto Regulation: What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks?

Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin has now emerged from this challenging phase. According to Rekt Capital\u2018s Analysis, which considers historical data and recent market trends, Bitcoin is entering a reaccumulation phase. This transition suggests a potential upward trajectory in its market value and marks a significant phase in the cryptocurrency\u2018s cycle, indicating a shift towards growth and stabilization.

Source: RektCapital/X Following the recent Bitcoin halving event, the cryptocurrency experienced a significant price drop, declining 23% from its mid-March high of $65,000 to a low of $56,800 on May 1. This period, known as the \u2018danger zone,\u2019 typically sees Bitcoin retreat in price as the market adjusts to the halved block rewards. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin has rebounded from these lows, indicating that the asset has moved into a reaccumulation phase. He emphasized that Bitcoin had bounced back strongly from the low support levels of its reaccumulation range, suggesting the potential bottom of this period was reached on May 1. Historical data supports this view, showing that Bitcoin typically experiences a decline around halving events. If $56,000 wasn\u2019t the bottom, this year\u2019s pullback at 63 days would match the longest in the cycle. However, Rekt Capital believes that the pullback concluded at $56,000 after 47 days. Bullish signals and global economic factors Adding to the positive outlook, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a recent buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on Bitcoin\u2019s hourly chart, suggesting an impending upswing. The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the #Bitcoin hourly chart, anticipating a price rebound! pic.twitter.com/BwSwXn2mgU \u2014 Ali (@ali_charts) May 14, 2024 The broader economic landscape also plays a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory. A major focus this week will be on the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), set to be released today. Forecasts indicate a CPI of 3.4% and a core CPI of 3.6%, both figures well above the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) target of 2%. This persistent high inflation suggests that interest rates might remain elevated longer than previously expected, potentially impacting investor sentiment and financial markets. Additionally, Raoul Pal, a renowned macro guru and CEO of Real Vision has identified the upcoming months as potentially advantageous for cryptocurrencies, describing a \u2018banana zone\u2018\u2014a period of enhanced global liquidity that historically correlates with strong performance in high-risk assets like Bitcoin. This could mean that external economic conditions may align to further fuel Bitcoin\u2019s ascent in the latter half of the year. What\u2019s next for BTC ? BTC 7 day price chart.

As Bitcoin exits the danger zone and indicators turn bullish, the market appears to be entering a phase of cautious optimism.

In that regard, OKX, a prominent crypto exchange, launched the public mainnet of X layer, its Zero knowledge proof powered network. As per the experts at Bitcoin Decode, the Layer 2 network was built using Polygon\u2019s chain development kit (CDK) that enables shared state and liquidity across multiple blockchain networks using the Ether scaling protocols Aggregation Layer. The experts say that this move addresses Ether\u2019s scalability issues while offering users a more cost-effective and efficient alternative for conducting transactions and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). The Key Features of OKX\u2019s Layer-2 Network At the core of OKX\u2019s Layer-2 solution is the promise of significantly lower fees and faster transaction processing times compared to Ether\u2019s mainnet. By leveraging Layer-2 technology, OKX aims to reduce the congestion on Ether\u2019s network, thereby minimizing gas fees and enhancing overall transaction. Users can now transfer tokens and execute smart contracts with incredible speed and efficiency while enjoying a more cost-effective experience. A recent report revealed that X Layer provides faster, cheaper transaction capabilities when interacting with on-chain applications. According to Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer from OKX, the \u2018X layer\u2019 and other layer-2 networks are set to become integral infrastructure for an interconnected Web3 ecosystem. \u201cWe are building a seamless and interoperable ecosystem. We think X Layer has limitless potential thanks to our community and its connectivity with another Ethereum-based network,\u201d said Rafique. Furthermore, OKX\u2019s Layer-2 network is designed to support a wide range of ERC-20 tokens and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, providing users with seamless interoperability across various Ether-based applications. This interoperability is crucial for fostering innovation within the Ether ecosystem, as it enables developers to build scalable dApps and deploy innovative solutions without being burdened by high fees and slow transaction speeds. Unlocking New Possibilities: The Impact of OKX\u2019s Layer-2 Solution on DeFi and Beyond The introduction of OKX\u2019s EtherLayer-2 network holds significant implications for the broader DeFi landscape and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. With lower fees and faster transaction times, DeFi platforms built on OKX\u2019s Layer-2 solution can offer users a more seamless and cost-efficient experience, ultimately driving greater adoption and liquidity within the DeFi space. OKX users can transfer assets, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies on OKX and access nearly 200 DApps offering token swaps, staking and smart contract functionality. Polygon CEO Marc Boiron highlighted that the move creates an interconnected liquidity network across blockchain protocols. Boiron said, \u201cX Layer\u2019s connection to the AggLayer solves the fragmentation of liquid and users across chains on the AggLayer so they can all grow together. OKX\u2019s 50 million users now have an easy path to onboarding to X Layer and all the other chains connected to the AggLayer.\u201d Moreover, OKX\u2019s Layer-2 network has the potential to catalyse innovation across various sectors beyond DeFi, including gaming, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralised exchanges (DEXs). By providing developers with a scalable and cost-effective infrastructure for building decentralised applications, OKX\u2019s Layer-2 solution opens the door to new use cases and opportunities previously hindered by Ether\u2019s scalability limitations.VanEck, an investment management firm, suggested that by 2030, Ether layer-2 networks could exceed $1 trillion in market capitalisation. Additionally, the networks have become integral to helping Ether achieve scale, powering low-fee, secure and decentralised transactions and applications. Conclusion OKX\u2019s Ethereum Layer-2 network represents a significant step forward in addressing Ethereum\u2019s scalability challenges while unlocking new possibilities for decentralised finance and beyond. With lower fees, faster transactions, and enhanced interoperability, OKX\u2019s Layer-2 solution can reshape the Ethereum ecosystem\u2019s future and accelerate the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology.","article_summary":"As Ethereum continues to face scalability challenges, with high gas fees hindering its mainstream adoption and congesting its network, the need for Layer-2 solutions has become more pressing.

Buckley has been publicly critical of Bitcoin and opposed offering Bitcoin ETF products to clients. Under Buckley's leadership, Vanguard refused to provide its brokerage customers access to U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the SEC. The appointment of Ramji, set to take effect July 8, signals a potential change in Vanguard's stance. As head of BlackRock's iShares division, Ramji oversaw the launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Ramji has spoken positively about the technology underpinning Bitcoin and its potential to remove friction in financial markets. His experience pioneering Bitcoin ETFs at BlackRock has many wondering if he will now push for similar offerings at Vanguard. Click the image to learn more. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, bringing in the bitcoin-friendly Ramji means the door is \"much more open now\" for Vanguard to embrace Bitcoin. The company offers index funds and ETFs to both retail and institutional investors.

The incident follows a significant breach in August 2023, when hackers exploited a vulnerability in Cypher\u2019s protocol, draining $1 million in cryptocurrencies. The attack exploited weaknesses in smart contracts, enabling the removal of bad loans and resulting in significant financial losses for the platform. The developer Cobra expressed disappointment, highlighting Hoak\u2019s betrayal. Hoak had remained with the project to aid in its recovery post-hack. The statement underscored the breach of trust and integrity within the development team, raising concerns about the security measures in place. In response to the fraud, Cobra announced intentions to pursue legal actions against Hoak, seeking accountability for the financial misconduct.

Pertsev has been given a sentence of 64 months in jail for his role in the creation and maintenance of the platform, which the court says has been used to conduct crimes and terrorism by hiding the origin, destination, and ownership of the crypto transactions, Court ruling on Tornado Cash Developer case The firm, created by Pertsev and two others, was meant to offer community privacy solutions. Nevertheless, the investigations proved that it was involved in the laundering of roughly $1 billion. The $2 billion amount of Ethereum went through various thefts and hacks. Pertsev\u2019s assertion that Tornado Cash was not made for illegal purposes was insufficient to dismiss the court\u2019s findings that there was proof of this. The court ruled Pertsev responsible for the development and the absence of measures to prevent abuse of Tornado Cash. It declared that the service was created, knowing the possibility of its misuse. To name a few, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus stole about $450 million worth of cryptocurrency. They sent it through Tornado Cash, thus showing that this service is very important for the criminal underworld.

The court convicted him of money laundering, which reflected the problems of software developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.

However, his post came hours after Ilya Sutskever, the co-founder of OpenAI, announced he was leaving the company and would pursue a \u201cproject that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d Prior to quitting OpenAI, Sutskever had gone silent since December 2023. With his first post since the break being a resignation notice, some people seemed concerned, given Sutskever\u2019s position in the company. Both Leike and Sutskever co-led the Superalignment team at OpenAI. The unit was formed to prevent superintelligent AI models from going rogue.

OpenAI said it can \u201celevate humanity.\u201d However, many argue that the substantial progress in AGI could possibly result in human extinction. Consequently, many people are concerned with how companies like OpenAI are building AGI. Sutskever, however, affirmed that OpenAI will build AGI that is safe. \u201cI\u2019m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial under the leadership of\u201d Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Mira Murati, and Jakub Pachocki.
