Our Jito price prediction expects JTO price to record a maximum level of $5.53 in 2024. In 2030, we expect JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain, which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we\u2019ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $4.2, resulting in a correction to $3.3. Is Jito A Good Investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to participate in governing one of the network\u2019s largest liquid staking protocols\u2014undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will have a keen interest in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito\u2019s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there\u2019s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, the unveiling of a future roadmap or the declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Recent JTO News/Opinions Jito, a liquid staking and MEV infrastructure project, now leads as the top protocol on Solana with $1.4 billion in total value locked. This equals about 10 million SOL, or roughly 38% of the Solana ecosystem\u2019s $3.7 billion TVL, per DeFiLlama. Marinade is second with $1.37 billion, followed by Kamino ($1 billion), Raydium ($613 million), and Marginfi ($424 million). Jito Price Prediction May 2024 Over the last few weeks, JTO coin price has been on an uptrend and it aims to record further gains by breaking above the $4.5 mark.
